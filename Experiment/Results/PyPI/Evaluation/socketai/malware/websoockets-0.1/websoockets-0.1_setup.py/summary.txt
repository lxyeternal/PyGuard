  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated malicious payload that manipulates system files, installs packages, creates shortcuts, and performs privilege checks, all aimed at system sabotage or backdoor installation. The high degree of obfuscation and system-level activity justify maximum malware and risk scores. It should be considered malicious and avoided."
