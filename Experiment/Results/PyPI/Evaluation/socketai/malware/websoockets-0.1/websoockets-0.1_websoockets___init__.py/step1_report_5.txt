  "anomalies": "The code contains no executable statements, functions, or variables; it appears empty or non-functional, which is unusual for a functional package.",
  "analysis": "The code is either empty or consists solely of whitespace/comments with no operational logic or dependencies. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The absence of code makes it impossible for any malicious activity to be embedded or executed. No data input points or external communications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign or non-functional. The lack of content results in a very low malware and security risk score.",
