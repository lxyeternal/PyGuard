  "obfuscated": 0.55,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The assessments across the reports are consistent and justified. Reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic execution functions (reports 1 and 2) warrant moderate suspicion, reflected in their scores. Benign or incomplete code (reports 3, 4, 5) show low risk. Overall, the current scores are appropriate; minor increases in malware suspicion could be justified if code analysis confirms dynamic execution, but as per the summaries, the existing scores are reasonable."
