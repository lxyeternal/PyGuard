  "conclusion": "The code contains high-probability malicious activity, executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, triggered by the absence of 'tahg'. The suspicious URL and obfuscation reinforce malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered compromised or malicious until further decoding confirms the payload's nature."
