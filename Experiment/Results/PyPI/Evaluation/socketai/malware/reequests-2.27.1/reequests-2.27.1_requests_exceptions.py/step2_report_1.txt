  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for HTTP request errors.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data processing or external input.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Standard class hierarchy, no malicious behavior, straightforward.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate, no security risks.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (or 0). The report assigns 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data processing.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Standard, no malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, typical exception module.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Again, reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data handling.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Standard exception hierarchy, no suspicious code.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious intent or security risks.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data processing.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Typical class definitions, no obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, benign code.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data processing.  \n- Anomalies: None.  \n- Analysis: Standard, straightforward exception classes.  \n- Conclusion: No malicious activity or security concern.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward exception class hierarchy.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The code is standard for a Python library's error handling module.\n- The assigned scores in all reports are consistent with the code's nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code, even a conservative higher risk score (e.g., 0.1) would be unwarranted. The code is purely structural, with no runtime data handling or external communication.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
