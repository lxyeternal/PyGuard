{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for HTTP request errors within the requests library, serving as a structured error handling mechanism.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class definitions that do not process external input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; purely class hierarchy definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; class inheritance and exception raising are static and do not involve untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward, standard, and lacks suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various HTTP-related exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and each other. It imports from well-known modules and does not perform any dynamic operations, network communication, or data handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is purely structural, providing a hierarchy for error handling in the requests library. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class hierarchy for a Python HTTP library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
