{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes related to request handling errors in the requests library.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; exception classes are used for error handling, not data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only sets up class hierarchies and exception handling structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward class definitions with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of exception class definitions used for error handling in HTTP requests. It imports external exception classes and defines subclasses, including some that add additional context or specify error types. No input handling, data processing, or network activity occurs. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. The code structure is standard for a library's exception module, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign exception class definition module for the requests library. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security threats are present.",
