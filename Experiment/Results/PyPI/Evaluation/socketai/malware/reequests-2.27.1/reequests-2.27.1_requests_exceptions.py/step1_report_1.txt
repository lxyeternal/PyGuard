{
  "purpose": "This module defines a set of exception classes for handling errors and warnings related to HTTP requests using the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3 and a local compatibility module. No input data sources are explicitly present; the code defines classes for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or handle untrusted data directly; it only defines exception classes that might be used elsewhere in the application.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this code since it solely defines exception classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The class definitions and imports are standard and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining various custom exception classes for request-related errors, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and library exceptions. It imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compatibility module. No input, data processing, or network activity occurs within this module. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard exception hierarchy for HTTP request error handling. It appears to be legitimate, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
