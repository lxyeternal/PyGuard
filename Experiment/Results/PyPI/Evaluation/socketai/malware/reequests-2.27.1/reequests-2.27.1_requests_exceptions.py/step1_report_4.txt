{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes for the Requests library, mainly to handle different error scenarios encountered during HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it defines exception classes used elsewhere in the application.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; this code solely defines error classes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data, as this code only establishes exception hierarchies and messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python exception module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from external modules and defines a set of custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions or other custom classes. The class hierarchy seems standard, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors are present. The module's purpose appears purely to facilitate error handling within the Requests library. No anomalies or malicious indicators are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class definition module for the Requests library, containing no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and aligns with typical Python package practices.",
