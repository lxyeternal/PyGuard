{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and warnings for the requests library to handle various HTTP and connection-related errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads only from imported modules and does not process external input directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly declares classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The structure follows standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for a Python HTTP requests library. It imports exceptions from external modules and defines subclasses for specific error conditions. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code does not interact with external data or perform any operations that could be malicious. It appears purely structural and informational, facilitating error handling within the library.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical exception class declaration module for handling request errors, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as part of the error handling mechanism without any indication of sabotage or malware.",
