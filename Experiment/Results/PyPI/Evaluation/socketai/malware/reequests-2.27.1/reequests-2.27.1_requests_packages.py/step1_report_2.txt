  "sinks": "Modifications to sys.modules for 'requests.packages' and related modules, affecting module namespace resolution.",
  "flows": "Importing 'chardet' or fallback, then remapping sys.modules entries for 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' to alter their module paths within 'requests.packages'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual manipulation of sys.modules to alter package namespace resolution, which could obscure original module sources. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or explicit malicious actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to maintain backward compatibility with older packages by dynamically importing 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'. It then remaps the modules 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' into 'requests.packages', likely to ensure compatibility with code expecting these modules in a specific namespace. This involves modifying sys.modules entries, which is an uncommon and potentially risky practice, but it is not inherently malicious. The code does not perform data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary purpose is to manipulate module namespaces for compatibility reasons, which is unusual but not malicious. There are no indicators of malware or malicious intent. It is a risky practice but not harmful per se, assuming intended behavior.",
