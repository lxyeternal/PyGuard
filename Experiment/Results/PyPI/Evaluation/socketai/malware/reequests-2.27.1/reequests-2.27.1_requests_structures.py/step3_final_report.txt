{
  "purpose": "Provides case-insensitive and lookup dictionary data structures used in request handling, particularly for HTTP headers and key-value data.",
  "sources": "Internal data storage in self._store, which is an OrderedDict; keys and values are set and retrieved via class methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; data is stored and retrieved internally without external communication or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into self._store via update or __setitem__, and data is retrieved via __getitem__, lower_items, or copy methods. No external data flows or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in both classes returns self._store.values(), which is an iterable view, not a proper copy. This is a functional bug but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, straightforward data structures for handling headers and lookup data. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication is present. The only notable issue is the incorrect implementation of the copy() method, which could cause functional bugs but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The code is readable, well-structured, and typical for utility modules in request libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor bug in the copy() method should be fixed for correctness but does not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0.",
