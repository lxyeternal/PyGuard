  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling HTTP headers and key-value lookup with case-insensitivity.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), data update methods (update), data retrieval methods (__getitem__, get), and internal storage (_store).",
  "sinks": "Methods accessing or manipulating data such as __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, and copy.",
  "flows": "Input data (initialization, updates) flow into internal storage (_store). Data retrieval flows from internal storage to calling functions via __getitem__, get, and other methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. Use of standard library collections and typical class methods. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are standard data structures for managing key-value pairs with case-insensitive keys or simple lookups. The classes use common Python patterns, including internal storage in OrderedDict and dict. There are no external data flows that could be exploited maliciously. No code injections, dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code primarily provides utility data structures for other parts of a larger application, likely HTTP request handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a utility module for data handling with no security concerns identified.",
