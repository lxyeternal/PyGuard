{
  "purpose": "The code embeds malicious activities, including downloading, extracting, and executing a cryptominer from an external source, and sending system data to a remote server, indicating active malware behavior and potential data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen calls for downloading miner and logging data; open/write operations for extracting and saving files; subprocess.Popen executing the miner binary; network requests to external logging server.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external miner binary via subprocess; network connections to remote server for logging; file system modifications during extraction and renaming.",
  "flows": "Code downloads miner archive -> extracts files -> runs miner process -> sends logs to external server; system info sent at startup and during miner operation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated directory paths (.config/.../ruda/krot); automatic execution of miner without user consent; silent subprocess execution; external communication with suspicious URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code begins as a standard requests library but includes functions that download a tar.gz archive from GitHub, extract it, and run a miner binary, which indicates cryptomining activity. It also sends system information to an external server. These functions are invoked automatically based on OS detection, leading to malicious activity on affected systems. The code's structure and external communications are suspicious, and the miner's download and execution are clear indicators of malicious intent. The network requests to Heroku and other URLs further suggest data exfiltration. The code is not obfuscated but contains hidden directories and silent execution, which are typical of malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively performs malicious operations, including cryptomining and data exfiltration, embedded within a seemingly legitimate library. The malicious activities are explicit and consistent across the code. The scores should reflect high malicious intent and security risk, with malware and risk scores at 1, and obfuscation remaining at 0. The code poses a severe security threat and should be flagged and removed from any distribution.",
