  "conclusion": "The code actively performs malicious operations, including cryptomining and data exfiltration, embedded within a seemingly legitimate library. The malicious activities are explicit and consistent across the code. The scores should reflect high malicious intent and security risk, with malware and risk scores at 1, and obfuscation remaining at 0. The code poses a severe security threat and should be flagged and removed from any distribution."
