The main risks are related to executing external files and commands, which are typical in such scripts but should be handled carefully. The package name suspicion warrants verification but is not inherently malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code actively performs malicious operations, including cryptomining and data exfiltration, embedded within a seemingly legitimate library. The malicious activities are explicit and consistent across the code. The scores should reflect high malicious intent and security risk, with malware and risk scores at 1, and obfuscation remaining at 0. The code poses a severe security threat and should be flagged and removed from any distribution."

The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The security risk score of approximately 0.2-0.3 reflects the unconventional nature but does not indicate malicious intent."
