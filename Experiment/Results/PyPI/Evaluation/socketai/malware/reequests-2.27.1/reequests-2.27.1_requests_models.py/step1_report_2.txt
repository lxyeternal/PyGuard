{
  "purpose": "The code provides core classes and functions for handling HTTP requests and responses in the 'requests' library, including request preparation, encoding, hooks, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include request parameters (method, url, headers, data, files, json, params, auth, cookies, hooks), and response content from raw network streams.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the request body (body, data, files, json), headers (including cookies, content-type), and response content (content, text, json).",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (e.g., request parameters) through encoding and preparation methods into request bodies or headers; responses flow from raw network streams through decoding, parsing, and properties like content or json.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. No obfuscation or unusual language features detected. Hooks are registered normally; no suspicious hook behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HTTP request/response handling with thorough input validation, encoding, and error handling. It uses safe practices like proper URL parsing, IDNA encoding, and content decoding. No code segments perform network connections, data exfiltration, or system damage. The functions and classes follow expected patterns for a request library. The only notable aspect is extensive error handling and support for streaming, which are standard features and not malicious. No anomalies such as hidden network calls or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical core implementation for an HTTP client library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles request and response data safely and efficiently. The security risk and malware scores are very low.",
