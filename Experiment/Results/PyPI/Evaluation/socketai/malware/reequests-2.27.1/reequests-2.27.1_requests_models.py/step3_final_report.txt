{
  "purpose": "The code implements core classes for handling HTTP requests and responses, including URL validation, encoding, header management, cookies, and response parsing, as part of an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "URL parsing and validation, header processing, cookie handling, request body encoding, response content reading.",
  "sinks": "Response content decoding, header handling, URL reconstruction, request body encoding.",
  "flows": "Input data (URL, headers, body, cookies) -> encoding/validation -> request preparation -> response parsing and content decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no network exfiltration, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL validation with IDNA encoding, safe header and cookie handling, proper request encoding (including multipart/form-data), and response content decoding. Error handling is comprehensive, and no suspicious patterns or network activity are present. The code aligns with typical HTTP client implementations, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an HTTP request/response handling module. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores from the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0. The risk score should be lowered from 0.5 to 0, as no security issues are evident.",
