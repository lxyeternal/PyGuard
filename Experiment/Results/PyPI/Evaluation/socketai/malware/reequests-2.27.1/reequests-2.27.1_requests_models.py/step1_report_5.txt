{
  "purpose": "This module defines core classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters during request and response preparation (e.g., URL, headers, data, files, cookies, hooks). It also reads from file-like objects during response content streaming.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe sinks include setting headers (like 'Cookie', 'Content-Length', 'Content-Type'), assigning request body data, and processing response content (decoding, parsing JSON). These are standard operations and do not involve untrusted data directly leading to code execution.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows include input parameters to methods like prepare_url, prepare_headers, prepare_body, and prepare_cookies. Data from these flows is used to construct request components. Response content is read and decoded, but only as per HTTP response, not from untrusted sources within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and well-defined methods for HTTP handling. There is no evidence of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious data exfiltration. The only notable pattern is the cautious handling of encoding and URL parsing, which is standard. The code does handle JSON decoding errors explicitly but does so in a benign manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for creating and preparing HTTP requests (Request, PreparedRequest) and for handling responses (Response). It carefully encodes URL parameters, handles headers and cookies, and manages request bodies with support for multipart data and JSON. The response class includes content streaming, decoding, and error handling. No suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution, network data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code adheres to standard security practices, such as cautious encoding, input validation, and error handling. All data flows appear to be within the expected scope of an HTTP client library and do not involve processing untrusted sources in a malicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard HTTP request and response processing with proper input validation and encoding practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a legitimate core part of a well-maintained HTTP client library, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
