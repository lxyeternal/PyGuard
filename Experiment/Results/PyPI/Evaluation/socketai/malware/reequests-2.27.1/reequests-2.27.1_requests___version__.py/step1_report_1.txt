{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' library, including title, description, URL, version, author information, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments at the beginning of the module, including metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted, and no untrusted input handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all data are static assignments intended for metadata purposes.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code consists solely of static metadata variable assignments. The comments are stylized ASCII art which does not impact execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata variables with static string values, including Unicode characters. There are no input, output, or data processing operations. No functions, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The presence of ASCII art comments is cosmetic and does not influence code behavior. The metadata aligns with standard package information conventions and shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely contains static metadata assignments for the 'requests' package, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks detected. It is a typical, benign package information file.",
