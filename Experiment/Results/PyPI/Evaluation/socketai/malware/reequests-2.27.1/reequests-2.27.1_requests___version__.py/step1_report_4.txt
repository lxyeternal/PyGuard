  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including version, author, license, and description.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables assigned from hardcoded string and numeric values.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static metadata to variables, no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward metadata assignment. Unicode characters in '__cake__' are benign decorative emojis.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variable assignments describing the 'requests' library. It includes versioning, author information, licensing, and descriptive text. There are no inputs, external data, or executable logic. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The Unicode emojis are harmless and serve as decoration. The file appears to be a standard metadata declaration typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as package metadata with no malicious intent. It does not contain any suspicious behavior, external data handling, or security risks.",
