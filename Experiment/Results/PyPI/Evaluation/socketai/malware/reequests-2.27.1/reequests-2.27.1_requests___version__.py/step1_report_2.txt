  "sources": "Metadata assignments at the beginning of the code: __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static string and numeric values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious activity detected. The code contains only straightforward metadata assignments with no dynamic execution, user input handling, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of variable assignments for package metadata. There are no functions, external calls, or data processing. All variables contain static, hardcoded values. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The presence of Unicode characters in __cake__ is benign and decorative. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for the 'requests' package and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
