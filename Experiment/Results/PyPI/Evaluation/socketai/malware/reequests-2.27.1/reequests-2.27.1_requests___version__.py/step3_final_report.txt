  "purpose": "Static package metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python library, containing descriptive variables and Unicode decorations.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.) with no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling points; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments do not involve data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Unicode characters (__cake__) are decorative; no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. No functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code are present. Unicode characters are purely decorative. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. The confidence level is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static package metadata file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
