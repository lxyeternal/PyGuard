{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, mainly for use in SSL/TLS certificate verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the path of the CA bundle to standard output using print().",
  "flows": "The 'where' function source flows to the print statement, displaying the path.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code performs a straightforward retrieval and display of a certificate bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package to locate the CA bundle. When run directly, it prints this path. No user input, network calls, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code is simple and intended for utility purposes, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that outputs the location of the default CA certificate bundle from certifi. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
