{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, mainly used for SSL/TLS verification in requests.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function from the certifi package, which retrieves the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path; however, this is a benign output with no untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function (source) flows directly to the print statement (sink), which outputs the path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from certifi, then prints the path to the CA bundle when executed directly. It contains no user input handling or external data processing. The code's intent is to display the default CA certificate bundle path, which is standard behavior for diagnostic or informational purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended to show the default CA bundle path from certifi. There are no signs of malware or security issues.",
