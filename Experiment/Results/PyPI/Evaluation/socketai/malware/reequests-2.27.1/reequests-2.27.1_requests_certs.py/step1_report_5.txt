{
  "purpose": "This module returns the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for configuration or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package via 'from certifi import where' and the '__main__' block calling 'print(where())'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' outputs the CA bundle path to standard output; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: 'where' function from 'certifi' -> Sink: 'print' outputs path to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and does not perform any unusual actions or contain hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known, reputable library 'certifi' to locate the CA bundle and prints the location when run directly. It is a minimal utility script with no input processing, network communication, or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It is simply retrieving and displaying a known file path.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that reports the location of the CA bundle provided by 'certifi'. There are no security issues or malicious behaviors present.",
