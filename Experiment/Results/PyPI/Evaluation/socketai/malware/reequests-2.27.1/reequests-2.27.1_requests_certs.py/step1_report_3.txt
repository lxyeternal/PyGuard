{
  "purpose": "This module provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location via 'where()' from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or data from unverified sources.",
  "flows": "The code calls 'where()' and prints its output; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi to identify the CA bundle path and prints it when executed directly. The code is simple, well-structured, and uses standard libraries. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or sensitive operations that could be malicious. There are no unusual or suspicious elements present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely to output the location of the CA bundle from certifi. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
