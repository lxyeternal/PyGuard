{
  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and calling 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'where()' function outputs the path to a CA bundle, which could be used as input for network requests or SSL verification.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi' and, if run as a script, prints the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard library and third-party modules appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to print the default CA bundle path provided by 'certifi'. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are present. The purpose aligns with legitimate SSL verification use cases. The code is minimal and standard in structure, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script to print the path of the trusted CA bundle from 'certifi'. It performs no malicious actions, contains no suspicious behavior, and is safe for use. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
