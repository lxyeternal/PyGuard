{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package, serving as a utility to identify the CA bundle location.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi'; execution of 'print(where())' when run as main.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or data leaks; output is a static file path.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' (source); execution of 'print(where())' (sink) when run as script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted library 'certifi' and prints the path to the CA bundle, which is a standard utility. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is purely informational, and its simplicity reduces the likelihood of security issues. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that safely outputs the CA bundle path. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and accurate, reflecting its harmless intent.",
