  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Describes cookie management utilities, extracting cookies, generating headers, etc.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard utility code, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Similar to report 1, cookie management utilities.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Standard cookie handling functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, cookie jar management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.95).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Cookie management, extraction, header creation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, no code behaviors suggestive of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal security risk, which is reasonable given the utility nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned across reports are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary; all scores are reasonable and justified.\n- Given the high confidence levels and the benign nature of the code, I would also assign:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0.2 (reflecting minimal security concern, standard for utility code)\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is standard, well-structured utility code for cookie management.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behaviors are present.\n- The scores in the reports are justified and aligned with the analysis.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and appropriate for use within the requests ecosystem.",
