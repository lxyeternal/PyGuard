  "purpose": "Utility module for managing cookies in requests, including extraction, header generation, and cookie jar manipulation.",
  "sources": "Request objects' URL and headers, response headers, cookie dictionaries, and existing cookie jars.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers added to requests, cookies stored/removed in cookie jars, and cookie extraction from responses.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers → cookie extraction and header creation → cookie jar updates and removals.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity; minor oversight in getheaders() not returning explicitly, but not security-critical.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured cookie management utilities with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It handles cookies safely, with no network connections, code injection, or backdoors. The data flows are limited to local cookie handling, and no external system modifications are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforwardness and clarity of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard cookie utility module with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
