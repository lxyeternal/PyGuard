  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes cookie utilities for requests, no network or system modification.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low).\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, utility functions for cookie management, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on cookie handling.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature as a utility module.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Again, standard cookie management functions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still within reasonable bounds given the code's purpose.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues with the scoring.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar utility functions for cookie handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate, as the code is purely utility.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard cookie management, no network activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious code or behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with risk scores ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, which are reasonable for utility code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of cookie management utilities.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The risk scores of 0.1–0.2 are appropriate, reflecting low security risk typical of utility code.\n- Malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
