  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a utility module for cookie management, compatible with requests and cookielib.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- The functions and classes handle cookies, headers, extraction, creation, and manipulation in a standard way.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears well-structured, purpose-driven, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- All data flows are standard for cookie handling.\n- No signs of malware or security risks.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The code is mostly utility functions and classes with minimal room for logical errors.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `getheaders()` in `MockResponse`, which does not return anything explicitly, but this is not a security issue, just a potential bug or oversight. However, it does not impact security or functionality critically here.\n- No significant flaws or mistakes that would impact security.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal risk. Given the code's purpose and content, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2. This is justified because the code is purely utility functions for cookie management, with no malicious or exploitable behavior.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9 to 0.95) are justified given the code's clarity and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, justified by utility nature)\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented utility module for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are—no adjustments needed. The code is safe and does not pose security risks.",
