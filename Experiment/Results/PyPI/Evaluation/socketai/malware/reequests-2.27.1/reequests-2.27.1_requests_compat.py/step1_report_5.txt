{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3 for the requests library, ensuring proper imports and type definitions across Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements for modules like chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, urllib, urlparse, urllib2, cookielib, Cookie, StringIO, collections, collections.abc, and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly manipulates untrusted input or data flows; it primarily handles module imports and type definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up environment compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard compatibility imports and definitions for cross-version support.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to maintain compatibility between Python 2 and 3 by conditionally importing modules and defining types accordingly. It handles optional dependencies like chardet and simplejson gracefully, without any suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments. All import statements and definitions serve the purpose of environment compatibility and are standard practice. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is present. The code contains typical version-specific import logic and type aliases, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module for Python 2 and 3 with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is safe and follows common practices for cross-version support.",
