{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3 for the requests library, providing unified access to functions and modules across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load external modules such as chardet, charset_normalizer, sys, simplejson/json, and various standard library modules based on Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the code mainly imports modules and assigns variables. No untrusted data handling or processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "The code detects Python version and conditionally imports modules and assigns variables accordingly, establishing environment-specific imports and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code is standard for compatibility handling, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by attempting to import optional modules (chardet, simplejson). It then detects Python version and imports appropriate modules from the standard library, setting variables for compatibility. The logic is straightforward, with no code execution based on untrusted input or dynamic code evaluation. All imports are standard for compatibility and do not contain malicious intent. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for handling differences between Python 2 and 3 in the requests library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be safe and purposeful.",
