{
  "purpose": "This module handles import compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3, providing unified interfaces for URL handling, JSON parsing, and other utilities across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info via sys.version_info and attempts to import optional dependencies such as chardet, simplejson, and standard library modules related to URL parsing, JSON, and cookies.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data leakage could occur. The code primarily sets up environment compatibility and imports modules.",
  "flows": "The source of version info influences the conditional imports and variable assignments, but no flow involves untrusted data reaching sinks for harmful effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. It performs standard compatibility handling with conditional imports based on Python version, which is common in cross-version code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on compatibility imports and variable definitions for cross-version support. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version and sets up aliases for string and numeric types. It also attempts to import optional libraries like chardet and simplejson. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. All imports and assignments are typical for a compatibility layer, with no suspicious logic or data flow. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any actions that could be exploited. Overall, it is a standard compatibility module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
