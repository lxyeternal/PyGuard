{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 for handling HTTP requests and related functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and third-party packages such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, json, urllib, urlparse, urllib2, cookielib, Cookie, StringIO, and collections.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into potential vulnerabilities; no use of input functions or untrusted data handling within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and sets up compatibility variables without processing external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is purely for compatibility and imports only standard libraries and modules.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a try-except block to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' to handle character encoding detection. It then checks Python version to conditionally import modules suitable for Python 2 or Python 3, setting up compatibility shims. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are performed. The code maintains cross-version compatibility without executing any external or untrusted data, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely imports necessary modules and sets version-dependent variables.",
