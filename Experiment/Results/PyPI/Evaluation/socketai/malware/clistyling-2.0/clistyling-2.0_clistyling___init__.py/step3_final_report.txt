{
  "purpose": "A terminal styling, animation, and UI utility library for colors, banners, cursor control, and layout management. Designed to enhance terminal aesthetics and interactivity.",
  "sources": "User input via input(), terminal size queries, environment variables, system commands (_system), stdout for display.",
  "sinks": "stdout for output, system commands for terminal control, user input collection; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input and system calls into terminal display functions; no external data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder functions and incomplete features (e.g., DynamicRGB, some color transitions), indicating unfinished code but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive terminal UI toolkit with functions for colors, banners, animations, and layout. It uses standard system calls and threading for animations. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors. Placeholders suggest ongoing development rather than obfuscation or sabotage. No suspicious data flows or external dependencies that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a benign terminal utility library primarily aimed at aesthetic and interface enhancements. It does not contain malicious code or sabotage mechanisms. Its potential for resource misuse exists but does not constitute malware. Overall security risk is very low.",
