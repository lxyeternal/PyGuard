{
  "purpose": "This code provides terminal manipulation and text formatting utilities, including color, centering, animations, and banner creation, primarily for aesthetic terminal displays.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for OS detection; calls system commands for terminal control; reads terminal size; takes user input in certain functions.",
  "sinks": "Executes system commands via _system(); uses input() for user input; writes ANSI escape codes to stdout; uses sleep and threading for animations.",
  "flows": "OS detection leads to conditional imports and function behaviors; terminal size influences positioning; user input and system commands are triggered within functions, affecting terminal state; animations read user input in a thread and manipulate cursor visibility and terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of detailed terminal control code, but no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Some placeholder variables (e.g., '...' in Colors.DynamicRGB) indicate incomplete code or intended dynamic behavior. No suspicious network connections or file manipulations are evident. The code includes animation and styling features which could be misused if embedded maliciously, but no malicious behavior is explicitly present.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly a utility library for terminal styling, colors, and animations. It manipulates terminal output, manages cursor visibility, and can perform animated text effects. Functions such as Init(), Clear(), Title(), Size(), and Command() call system commands, which could be misused if user inputs commands unsafely, but within this code, they are straightforward wrappers. No network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. User input is handled locally via input(), with no external data leaks observed. The threading used for animations appears to be standard. Some functions like DynamicRGB() and certain color transitions are incomplete, but no malicious logic is embedded in their placeholders. Overall, the script's behavior aligns with terminal styling tools, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a comprehensive terminal styling and animation library without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily manipulates terminal output, cursor visibility, and colors. No malicious or security-compromising features are detected within this code snippet.",
