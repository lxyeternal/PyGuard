{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of terminal manipulation, coloring, and animation utilities for text display, including features for terminal control, color effects, text centering, and graphical banner creation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from user (input functions), terminal size information, and executes system commands (e.g., 'cls', 'clear', 'title', 'mode'). Uses system calls for terminal control and command execution.",
  "sinks": "Uses system calls to modify terminal (e.g., clearing screen, setting title, resizing). Accepts user input via input() functions. Writes colored and animated text to stdout. Potentially vulnerable if inputs are maliciously crafted (e.g., if used in system commands).",
  "flows": "Input functions (e.g., input()) accept user input; terminal control functions execute system commands; text display functions write colored/animated output to stdout. These flows are straightforward, with no external untrusted data sources other than user input.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hidden code, or unusual dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward in its function. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Functions like System.Command() execute arbitrary system commands, which could be exploited if user-controlled input is passed externally, but within this code, no such direct usage is evident. Some placeholder variables (e.g., in Colors.DynamicRGB and mode functions) are incomplete or undefined, but do not constitute malicious behavior. The code’s comments suggest it's meant for aesthetic terminal effects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive terminal utility library focused on text coloring, animation, and layout. It uses system commands for terminal management, which could be risky if inputs are externally controlled; however, within this code, no such unsafe usage is visible. The inclusion of functions for hiding/showing cursor, coloring text, and creating graphical banners does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or reverse shell capabilities are present. The code's design is consistent with terminal UI effects. Placeholders in the Colors class indicate unfinished features but do not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a terminal UI utility library for aesthetic text effects and control, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on system commands and user input, which can be misused if misapplied, but the code itself does not contain malicious intent or malware. It appears safe for use in terminal customization and effects.",
