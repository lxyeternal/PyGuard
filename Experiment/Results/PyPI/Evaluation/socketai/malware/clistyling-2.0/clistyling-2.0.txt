      "conclusion": "The code itself is not malicious but contains a highly suspicious pattern of downloading and executing remote code during setup, representing a significant security risk. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks or malware droppers, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The remote URL and silent execution further exacerbate the threat. Overall, this pattern should be flagged for review, validation, or removal to prevent potential compromise."
