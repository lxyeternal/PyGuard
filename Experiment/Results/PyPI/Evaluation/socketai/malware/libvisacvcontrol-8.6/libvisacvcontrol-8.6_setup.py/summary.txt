  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation, stealth execution, and embedding within a package setup suggest intent to conceal malicious payloads. Scores of approximately 0.9 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. It should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious pending further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command."
