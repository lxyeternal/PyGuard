  "conclusion": "The code performs a highly suspicious and potentially malicious operation by appending external code into the source file of a core Python library (socket). This behavior indicates a serious security risk, likely malicious, and warrants immediate attention. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The activity resembles a supply chain attack or backdoor insertion, making this package unsafe for use without thorough review and verification."
