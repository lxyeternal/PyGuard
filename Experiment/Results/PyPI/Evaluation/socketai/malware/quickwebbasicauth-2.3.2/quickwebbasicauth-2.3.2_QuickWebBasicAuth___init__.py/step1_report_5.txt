{
  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration and define some module metadata and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging; module metadata variables; function add_stderr_logger() which creates and adds a logging StreamHandler.",
  "sinks": "None present; code primarily deals with logging setup and metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions or output; the code only manipulates logging handlers and module metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for setting up logging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, defines a NullHandler fallback for older Python versions, sets module metadata, and defines a utility function to add a stderr logger with a specific format and level. The code performs no network activity, data processing, or input handling that could lead to security issues. The removal of NullHandler is benign cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard logging setup code with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
