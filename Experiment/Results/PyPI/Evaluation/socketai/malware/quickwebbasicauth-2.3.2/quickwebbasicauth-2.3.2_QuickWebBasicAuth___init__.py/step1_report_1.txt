  "purpose": "Set up logging configuration and define package metadata for the FlaskBasicAuth package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging, package metadata variables, and the add_stderr_logger function.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers that output to stderr, no untrusted input processing or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Logging setup flows from import to configuration of log handlers; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily manages logging and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging handlers with standard library modules, defines package metadata, and provides a utility function to add stderr logging. It handles exceptions for compatibility between Python 2.7+ and earlier versions. The code appears to be standard setup code without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No untrusted data sources, secret handling, or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard logging setup and package metadata configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
