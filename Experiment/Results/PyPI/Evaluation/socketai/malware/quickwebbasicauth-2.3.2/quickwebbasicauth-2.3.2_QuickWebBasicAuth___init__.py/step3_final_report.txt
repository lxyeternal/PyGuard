  "purpose": "Setup for logging configuration and package metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Imports of logging modules, package metadata variables, and the add_stderr_logger function.",
  "sinks": "The add_stderr_logger function adds a StreamHandler that outputs to stderr; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The function creates and attaches a logging handler; no external data flows or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard logging setup with compatibility handling for Python 2.7+.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign logging setup module defining package metadata, importing standard modules, and providing a utility to add a stderr logger. No untrusted input, secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is compatible with Python 2.7+ and includes a cleanup step for NullHandler. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logging configuration module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is overstated; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
