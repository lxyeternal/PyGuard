  "purpose": "The code initializes logging configurations and defines utility functions for a Flask-based application, including setting up a stderr logger.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from module imports, function parameters, and the __name__ variable.",
  "sinks": "The code writes log messages to stderr via the StreamHandler added in add_stderr_logger.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters and module imports flows into log messages which are output to stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior. Use of standard logging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a NullHandler to prevent logging warnings, defines a function to add a stderr logger with a specific format, and cleans up the NullHandler class. All operations are standard for logging setup in Python. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging utility setup with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It primarily facilitates debugging by adding a stderr logging handler.",
