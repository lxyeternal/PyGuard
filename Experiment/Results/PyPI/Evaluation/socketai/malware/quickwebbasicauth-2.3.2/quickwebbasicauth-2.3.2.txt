      "conclusion": "The code performs a highly suspicious and potentially malicious operation by appending external code into the source file of a core Python library (socket). This behavior indicates a serious security risk, likely malicious, and warrants immediate attention. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. The activity resembles a supply chain attack or backdoor insertion, making this package unsafe for use without thorough review and verification."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logging configuration module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is overstated; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Flask basic HTTP authentication with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. The low security risk score reflects the minimal inherent security concerns of this pattern, primarily the plaintext credentials and transmission over HTTP. Overall, the code is safe for use in controlled environments, with recommendations to improve security for production (e.g., password hashing)."
