  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed to establish persistent remote access across multiple platforms by fetching and executing remote code. It employs persistence mechanisms and hiding techniques typical of malware or backdoors. The remote code execution and system manipulation justify a high malware and security risk score."
