  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated PowerShell payload execution during package installation, with stealth tactics and error suppression. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack vectors. Scores should reflect high malicious likelihood and obfuscation."
