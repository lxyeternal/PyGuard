{
  "purpose": "Detects execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Checks for 'tahg' directory; reads environment and filesystem; executes encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check leads to execution of encoded PowerShell command, which may perform malicious actions silently.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell payload; silent error handling; execution with hidden window; broad try-except blocks suppress errors.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for a specific directory and, if absent, executes an encoded PowerShell command with hidden window, suppressing errors. The payload is obfuscated, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The use of subprocess with shell=False but passing a string is technically incorrect but masked by broad exception handling. The pattern of obfuscated, stealthy execution during setup strongly suggests supply chain malicious activity or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent due to obfuscated PowerShell payload execution during package installation, with stealth tactics and error suppression. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack vectors. Scores should reflect high malicious likelihood and obfuscation.",
