  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but the actual intent cannot be determined without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present). Specific source points are not explicitly shown due to lack of code details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, file writes, or sensitive data handling points, but explicit sinks are not clearly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like system commands or network endpoints, possibly passing through intermediate processing steps; exact flow paths cannot be confirmed without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or malicious indicators such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected in the visible code fragment. Lack of clear malicious behavior or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. No unusual dynamic execution, suspicious imports, or unsafe data handling observed. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common coding practices. Without additional context or hidden code segments, no malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious indicators identified. However, incomplete code context limits absolute certainty.",
