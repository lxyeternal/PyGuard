  "conclusion": "The code appears largely benign across most reports, with one notable exception (report 4) exhibiting signs of obfuscation and malicious activity. The scoring is consistent with the evidence, and overall, the package can be considered low risk with targeted caution. The high suspicion in report 4 warrants further investigation before deployment or inclusion in supply chains."
