  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to retrieve user information, currently unimplemented.",
  "sources": "None; the function body is empty, no data is read.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; function is a stub.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'requests'; function not implemented; code is a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an unimplemented function with no active logic, data flow, or network activity. The import of 'requests' is unused, indicating incomplete code. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's current state is benign and serves as a stub for future development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious placeholder with no active security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate given its current state.",
