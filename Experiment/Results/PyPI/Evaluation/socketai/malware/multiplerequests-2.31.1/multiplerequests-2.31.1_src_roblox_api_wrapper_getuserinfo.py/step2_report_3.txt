  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the details provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify that the code is a stub: a function defined but not implemented.\n- The 'requests' library is imported but unused in all cases.\n- No actual data sources, network requests, or data flows are present.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code appears incomplete or a placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Issues present?** No. The function is empty, no active code.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None; correctly notes it's a stub.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern; just incomplete.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No; consistent with the previous.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Placeholder code, no issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1 seem fine.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0 are suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Incomplete stub, no malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Placeholder, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports assign malware=0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. Risk scores are low, reflecting the code's incomplete and benign nature.\n\n- **Is there any evidence of malicious intent?**  \n  No. The import of 'requests' without usage and an unimplemented function is typical of stub code.\n\n- **Any assumptions or potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code does not process data, make network requests, or handle secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code is a stub with no active behavior, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is justified. Slightly above 0 (e.g., 0.1) could be acceptable to account for potential future issues, but in the current state, 0 is more precise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a placeholder with no malicious or risky behavior. The current scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
