  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the reported issues with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the `getuserinfo` function is defined but unimplemented (`pass`), with no actual logic or network activity.\n- The `requests` library is imported but not used in any report, which suggests incomplete code or placeholders.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present; the code appears to be a stub.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident in the current code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the function is intended to retrieve user info, likely via network.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No active data sources or sinks; the function is empty.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the import and unimplemented function, but nothing suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; code is a stub.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, considering the code's incomplete state. Malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the function's lack of implementation and no active data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk is even lower (0), which is appropriate. Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Reiterates the lack of implementation and unused import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same observations: function is empty, import unused.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate low risk score.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Also notes the function is a placeholder, no logic, no network calls.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n**Assessment:** The lowest risk score (0) is justified here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, since code is straightforward and unimplemented.\n- **Risk:** Slight variation (0.1 vs 0), but given the code is just a stub, 0 or 0.1 are reasonable.\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the current code state.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The code does not contain any active malicious or vulnerable behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** (slightly above zero due to import, but overall very low risk)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No active code execution, data flow, or network activity.  \n- The import of `requests` alone does not indicate malicious intent.  \n- The code appears to be a placeholder or stub, with no security concerns at this stage.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a minimal stub with no malicious or security issues, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
