  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to retrieve information about a logged-in user",
  "sources": "The 'requests' library imported at the beginning; the 'user' parameter passed to getuserinfo()",
  "sinks": "Potential network request made through 'requests' (if implemented); data handling within getuserinfo()",
  "flows": "Input from 'user' object flows into the getuserinfo() function; external request might send data over the network",
  "anomalies": "Function is unimplemented (pass); no actual logic or data handling present; only import and function definition exist",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' but does not use it, and defines an unimplemented function with no logic. There is no data processing, no network calls, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code appears incomplete or a placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is incomplete, functioning as a stub with no operational behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity or security issues in its current form.",
