  "malware_score": 1,

  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior typical of malware, involving remote code fetch, decoding, and execution without validation, and stealthy process execution. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the high scores assigned are justified. The code should be flagged as malicious and handled accordingly."
