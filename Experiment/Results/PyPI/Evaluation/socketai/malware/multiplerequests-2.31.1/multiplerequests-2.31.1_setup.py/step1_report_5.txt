{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package using setuptools, then downloads an external script from a remote URL, decodes it from base64, writes it to a file in the user's roaming directory, and executes it asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Request to a remote URL (https://frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com/getpackage), reading response data, reading README.md file",
  "sinks": "Writing decoded data to a local file, executing the local file via subprocess.Popen",
  "flows": "Remote URL data (package_name) is decoded from base64 and written into a file, then that file is executed asynchronously",
  "anomalies": "Fetching a package from an untrusted URL, executing code decoded from base64 without validation, writing to user directory, no verification of downloaded content, use of exec() on untrusted data, running process with suppressed window",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a typical setup for a Python package, which is benign. However, the subsequent code downloads data from an external URL, which could be malicious. The response is read as raw bytes, then directly decoded from base64 and executed via exec() without validation or sanitization. The code writes this decoded content to a file in the user's roaming profile directory and launches it asynchronously with suppressed window, preventing visibility. These behaviors are indicative of potential malicious activity, such as remote command execution, backdoor installation, or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any checks on the downloaded content, nor does it restrict what can be executed, making it highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading, decoding, and executing remote code without validation, which poses a high security risk. It appears designed to stealthily run remote code on the host system, potentially for malicious purposes.",
