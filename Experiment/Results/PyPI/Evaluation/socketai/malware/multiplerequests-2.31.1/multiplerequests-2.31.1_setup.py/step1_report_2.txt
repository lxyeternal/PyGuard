  "purpose": "Setup and package configuration, followed by downloading and executing remote code.",
  "sources": "Reading from URL at 'https://frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com/getpackage' and the local file system for writing 'frvezdffvvcode.py'.",
  "sinks": "Executing dynamically decoded base64 content via exec() and launching subprocess with the downloaded script.",
  "flows": "Request to remote URL -> download content -> write to file -> decode base64 and execute -> run script in subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading code from an obfuscated URL and executing it dynamically without validation. Use of 'exec' with remote content is suspicious. The filename and URL are non-descriptive and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup with setuptools, then downloads a payload from a suspicious URL. The payload is stored as base64-encoded data, decoded at runtime, and executed dynamically. The use of 'exec' on remote code, combined with launching the code in a separate process, indicates potentially malicious activity. The code does not verify the integrity or origin of the remote payload, which poses a security risk. The naming and obfuscated URL are signs of malicious intent. No benign functionality justifies this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script downloads and executes remote code dynamically without validation, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. It could be used to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the user's system.",
