{
  "purpose": "Function to send a message from a user to a recipient",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user, recipient, message",
  "sinks": "Potentially where the message is sent or processed; however, the function implementation is empty",
  "flows": "User, recipient, and message data are passed into the send function but are not processed or transmitted due to the empty function body",
  "anomalies": "The function is defined but contains no implementation; no data processing, network calls, or side effects observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a send function with parameters that suggest message transmission functionality. However, the function body is empty ('pass'), indicating no actual processing, data handling, or transmission occurs. No data is read or written, and no external calls or operations are present. As such, the code does not perform any actions, malicious or otherwise. Its purpose appears to be a placeholder or interface definition without implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a placeholder function with no operational code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues since the function does nothing. It likely serves as a stub for future implementation.",
