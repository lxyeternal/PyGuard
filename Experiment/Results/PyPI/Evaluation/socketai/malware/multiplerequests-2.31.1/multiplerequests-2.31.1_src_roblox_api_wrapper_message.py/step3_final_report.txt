{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function intended to send messages between users",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'user', 'recipient', 'message' (inputs), but no data is processed or read",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission occurs; function does nothing",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; function body is empty with 'pass'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward stub with no implementation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines an unimplemented 'send' function with parameters for user, recipient, and message. All reports correctly identify it as a placeholder with no operational logic, data processing, or network activity. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. Malware scores are consistently zero, and confidence levels are high, reflecting the benign and incomplete nature of the code. The security risk scores are also minimal, with most at 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the lack of active functionality. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no security threat in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, unimplemented placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
