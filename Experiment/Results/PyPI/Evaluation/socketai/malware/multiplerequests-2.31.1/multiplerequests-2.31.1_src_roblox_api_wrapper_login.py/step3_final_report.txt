  "purpose": "Placeholder functions for Roblox login API interactions, currently inert.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: cookie, username, password",
  "sinks": "None, as functions do nothing",
  "flows": "No data flow; functions are empty",
  "anomalies": "Functions are unimplemented; no logic or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two stub functions with 'pass' statements, accepting sensitive parameters but performing no actions. No data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The functions' design indicates they are placeholders for future implementation. The parameters involve sensitive data, which could pose risks if later implemented insecurely, but currently, there is no active threat. The malware score is correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The security risk score is low (~0.1), acknowledging potential future concerns if these functions are misused. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the code's simplicity and inert state.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign as it stands, serving as placeholders without active behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. Future implementations should handle sensitive data securely to prevent potential risks.",
