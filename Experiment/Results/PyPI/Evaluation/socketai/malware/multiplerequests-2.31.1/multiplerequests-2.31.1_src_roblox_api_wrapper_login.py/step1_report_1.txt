  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for login to roblox.com API, currently not implemented.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cookie', 'username', and 'password'.",
  "sinks": "No actual sinks or data processing present as functions are empty.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as functions do nothing.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are defined but contain no logic; potential for future malicious code insertion exists, but currently none.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for login purposes but does not implement any logic. The parameters suggest login credentials or cookies might be used, but without implementation, there's no malicious activity. The code itself is minimal and inert, with no data handling, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. However, the presence of such stub functions could be a placeholder for future malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code currently does nothing malicious; it is a placeholder with no active behavior. Risk is very low, but future implementations could introduce security concerns.",
