{
  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for logging into roblox.com API, possibly for automation or account access.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'cookie', 'username', 'password' in functions 'cookielogin' and 'userpasslogin'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present as the functions currently do nothing; potential sinks would be if these functions stored, transmitted, or used credentials insecurely.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur since functions are empty; in a complete implementation, credentials could flow from input parameters to network requests or storage.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are unimplemented; no code execution, no handling of credentials, no network calls, or other behaviors. The presence of login functions suggests potential for malicious use if implemented, but as-is, no malicious activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two placeholder functions intended for login operations with no implementation. They currently perform no actions, do not process or store data, and do not execute any behavior that could be malicious. Without further implementation, there's no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The structure suggests future use for authentication automation, but in its current state, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely skeletal with no active logic or data handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues as-is but indicates potential for future malicious use if implemented improperly.",
