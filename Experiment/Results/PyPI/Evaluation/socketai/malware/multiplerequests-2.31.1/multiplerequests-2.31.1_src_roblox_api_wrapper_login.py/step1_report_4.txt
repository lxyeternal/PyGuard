  "purpose": "Placeholder functions intended for user authentication via Roblox API using cookies or username/password.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (cookie, username, password)",
  "sinks": "None, as the functions currently do nothing",
  "flows": "No data flows occur, as functions are unimplemented",
  "anomalies": "Functions are empty with no implementation; no code execution or data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two stub functions intended for login purposes but contains no implementation. There are no data processing, no handling of untrusted input, and no execution of suspicious or malicious code. The functions are placeholders with no active behavior, and there are no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or security risks at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code consists solely of empty function definitions with no active logic or malicious intent. It appears to be a skeletal setup for future implementation. No security risks, malware, or anomalous behaviors are present in this code fragment.",
