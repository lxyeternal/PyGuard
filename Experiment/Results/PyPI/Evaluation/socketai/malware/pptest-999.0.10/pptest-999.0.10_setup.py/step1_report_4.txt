  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pptest' package, defining installation behavior and entry points.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools, defines custom install_scripts class, reads package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Setup process involving custom script renaming during installation, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Custom script renaming logic, but implementation appears incomplete or incorrect due to missing 'basename' and 'shutil' imports; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py with a custom class intended to rename scripts after installation. However, the script uses 'basename' without importing os.path.basename, and 'shutil.move' is called without importing shutil, which could cause runtime errors but not malicious activity. No input/output flows indicate untrusted data handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The renaming logic does not introduce malicious behavior but seems to be incomplete or buggy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with an intended custom script renaming feature. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The main issue is incomplete implementation, not malicious intent.",
