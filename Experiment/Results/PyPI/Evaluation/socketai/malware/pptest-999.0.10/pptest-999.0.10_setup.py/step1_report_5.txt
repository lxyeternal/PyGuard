{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup configuration, including custom script installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, importing modules, and reading output script paths via self.get_outputs()",
  "sinks": "Moving files using shutil.move() which can modify or replace existing files in the filesystem",
  "flows": "get_outputs() provides script paths -> script renaming and moving via shutil.move()",
  "anomalies": "Use of self.get_outputs() without validation; potential missing import for 'shutil' and 'basename' usage without definition; printing debug info; minimal logic for renaming files",
  "analysis": "The script extends setuptools to customize script installation behavior, renaming scripts ending with .py or .sh. It imports 'setup' and 'install_scripts' but lacks import for 'shutil' and 'basename', which suggests incomplete or faulty code. The renaming logic is straightforward but lacks validation, and debug print statements are included. No malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code primarily manages package setup and script file renaming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with minor custom script renaming logic, containing no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. Missing imports and incomplete variable references are technical issues but not malicious.",
