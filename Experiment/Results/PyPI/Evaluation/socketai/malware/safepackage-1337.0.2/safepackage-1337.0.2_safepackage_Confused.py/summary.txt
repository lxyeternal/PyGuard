  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, acting as a credential stealer with active data exfiltration. It does not contain obfuscation. The behavior warrants a malware score of 1, high security risk score of 1, and no obfuscation (score 0). All signals confirm active malicious intent with high confidence."
