  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'safepackage' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup functions, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input is directly used in a way that could cause data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content as long description; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, importing necessary modules, reading a README file for long description, and defining package metadata. The install_requires field only lists 'requests', a common dependency, with no dynamic or untrusted input. No suspicious logic, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical setup.py files.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard package configuration script with no indicators of malware or security concerns.",
