  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project named 'safepackage'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; dependencies list ('requests').",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external commands, or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data from files and variables; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual version number '1337.0.2' but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The version number '1337.0.2' is unconventional but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. All security signals are clean, and the code functions as intended for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
