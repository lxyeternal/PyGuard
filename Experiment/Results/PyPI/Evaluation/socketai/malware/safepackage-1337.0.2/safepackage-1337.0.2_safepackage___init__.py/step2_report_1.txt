  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports focus solely on import statements, with no evidence of data flow, source, or sink activities.\n- The module name 'Confused' appears suspicious across reports, hinting at obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The use of wildcard imports ('*') is a risky practice, as it conceals what is actually imported, making analysis more difficult.\n- No actual code logic, data processing, or network activity is visible, which limits definitive conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Code Presence:\n\n- The original code **only** contains import statements:\n  ```python\n  from safepackage.Confused import *\n  from safepackage.calc import *\n  ```\n- No data flows, sources, sinks, or other logic are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe issues reported are *not* about malicious behavior directly observable from this code snippet but are about potential obfuscation and suspicious naming.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import modules, suspicion due to 'Confused'.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.6 — high, justified by the module name and wildcard import.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 — somewhat low, but still indicates some concern.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — moderate, considering the suspicion but no direct evidence.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The high obfuscation score aligns with the module name and import style. Malware score is low but not zero, reflecting some concern.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with focus on module naming.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — inconsistent, given the suspicious name 'Confused'.\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe obfuscated score should be higher due to the module name 'Confused'. The reasoning is similar to Report 1, but the score undervalues the suspicion.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — again, inconsistent with the suspicious name.\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with low suspicion.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nObfuscated score should be increased; module name 'Confused' warrants a higher suspicion level.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — again, inconsistent.\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nObfuscated score should be higher, given the module name.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — slightly higher, but still low.\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nObfuscated score should be higher, similar to previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of issues:\n\n- **Obfuscated scores** are generally too low given the suspicious module name 'Confused'.\n- **Malware scores** are low but could be slightly higher if there are concerns about obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores** are reasonable but could be adjusted upward based on the suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated scores** should be increased to reflect the suspicious naming, perhaps to around 0.7, especially since the code uses wildcard imports and an unusual module name.\n- **Malware scores** should remain low unless further evidence suggests malicious activity.\n- **Risk scores** should be adjusted upward accordingly, perhaps to 0.4 or 0.5, given the potential for obfuscation to hide malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 — no direct evidence, but keep cautious.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 — module name 'Confused' and wildcard imports are suspicious.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 — moderate, due to potential obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious activity, but the naming and import style raise suspicion of obfuscation. The scores should reflect this higher suspicion.\n\n**Final note:**  \nFurther analysis of the actual content of `safepackage.Confused` and `safepackage.calc` is necessary to confirm whether malicious code exists. For now, the concern centers on potential obfuscation rather than confirmed malware.",
