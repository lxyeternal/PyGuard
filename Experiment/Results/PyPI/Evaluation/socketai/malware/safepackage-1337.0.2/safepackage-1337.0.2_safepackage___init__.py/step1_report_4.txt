{
  "purpose": "Importing modules from the 'safepackage' package, likely for further processing or functionality within the larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'safepackage.Confused' and 'safepackage.calc' modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow cannot be determined as the code only shows import statements without further logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements with no additional logic; the module names 'Confused' and 'calc' could be benign or suspicious depending on their content. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules from a package named 'safepackage'. The module names are generic, with one called 'Confused', which might suggest obfuscation or complexity, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. Since no functions, data handling, or other logic are present, there are no observable sources or sinks. The code is minimal and standard in structure, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior. Without examining the content of these modules, no malicious activity can be confirmed or ruled out solely based on these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The import statements are standard, and no suspicious patterns are evident. Further review of the imported modules is necessary to fully assess their security implications.",
