The scores should reflect a low malware likelihood but moderate suspicion of obfuscation. Further analysis of the actual content of the imported modules is recommended to confirm or refute malicious intent."

The behavior warrants a malware score of 1, high security risk score of 1, and no obfuscation (score 0). All signals confirm active malicious intent with high confidence."
