  "purpose": "The function calc adds two input values, likely for basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Inputs x and y received as function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the sum of x and y.",
  "flows": "Input parameters x and y flow directly to the return statement after addition.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function performing addition. It reads two inputs and returns their sum. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, and no code injection points. The structure is straightforward. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic arithmetic function with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
