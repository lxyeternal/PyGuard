  "purpose": "Simple function to calculate the sum of two numbers",
  "sources": "Parameters x and y are input values to the function",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no untrusted data handling beyond input parameters",
  "flows": "Input parameters x and y are processed directly and their sum is returned",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic addition function with no external data sources, no insecure operations, and straightforward logic. It lacks any network operations, file handling, or environment variable usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies; it appears to be a benign utility function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless function for adding two numbers with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
