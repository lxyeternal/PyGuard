  "purpose": "A simple addition function intended to compute the sum of two inputs.",
  "sources": "Function parameters x and y as input sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters x and y flow directly to the return statement, producing the output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function performing addition without external dependencies, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a basic addition operation with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
