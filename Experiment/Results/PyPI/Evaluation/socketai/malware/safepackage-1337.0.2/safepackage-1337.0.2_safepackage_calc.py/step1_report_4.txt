  "purpose": "Simple function to calculate the sum of two inputs",
  "sources": "Inputs to the calc() function (parameters x and y)",
  "sinks": "Return statement output",
  "flows": "Inputs x and y are directly returned as their sum",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward addition operation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'calc' that sums two parameters and returns the result. There are no external data sources, no hardcoded credentials, no use of environment variables, no network activity, and no complex or obfuscated code. The function is simple and appears to serve a basic arithmetic purpose. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors present, nor any signs of code injection, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign function for addition with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
