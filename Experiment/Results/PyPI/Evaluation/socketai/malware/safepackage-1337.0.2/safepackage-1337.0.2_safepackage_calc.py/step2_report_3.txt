  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a straightforward function: `def calc(x,y): return x + y`.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a simple addition function with no external dependencies, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed in any report.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the reports' observations are accurate.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently and accurately describe the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - No report mentions any potential vulnerabilities, such as injection, data leaks, or misuse.\n   - **No issues detected** in their reasoning or summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence in their assessment)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's simplicity.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments indicate no malicious or suspicious behavior, a `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified.\n   - The `malware` score is also 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code performs a benign addition operation with no malicious behavior.\n   - **No issues here.**\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's straightforward nature.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is a trivial addition function, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign; all scores are appropriate, and the analysis is consistent and justified.",
