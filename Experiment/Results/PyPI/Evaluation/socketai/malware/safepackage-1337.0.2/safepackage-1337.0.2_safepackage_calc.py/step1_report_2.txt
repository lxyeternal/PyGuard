  "purpose": "The function calc is intended to compute and return the sum of two input values x and y.",
  "sources": "Input parameters x and y received directly as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the sum; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters x and y to the return statement that outputs their sum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple addition function with straightforward logic. No external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior detected. The function does not contain obfuscation or malicious code patterns. It performs a basic arithmetic operation with no side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple addition, and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
