{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling various API errors in an OpenAPI client library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; exception classes are instantiated with parameters.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and attributes could potentially leak data if improperly handled, but no direct data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; exception handling involves message formatting and attribute setting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Code is straightforward exception class definitions and a utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base OpenApiException, each tailored for specific HTTP errors or validation issues. Exception messages are constructed dynamically with optional context. The render_path function constructs a string path representation from a list, used in error messages. No data from external sources is processed directly, nor is there any network activity or data manipulation that could be malicious. The code does not contain obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard exception handling module for an API client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code segment. It appears safe and standard.",
