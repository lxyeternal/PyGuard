  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various API errors and provide utility functions for rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code mainly defines classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions and error handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions, including handling for HTTP response errors. It includes methods to format error messages and to instantiate exceptions based on HTTP response status codes. No data is fetched from or sent to external sources, nor does the code perform any network operations, file I/O, or data processing that could be exploited maliciously. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors evident. The functions are straightforward, and the logic adheres to standard patterns for API error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for API error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated malicious code. It appears to be a standard utility module for managing API exceptions.",
