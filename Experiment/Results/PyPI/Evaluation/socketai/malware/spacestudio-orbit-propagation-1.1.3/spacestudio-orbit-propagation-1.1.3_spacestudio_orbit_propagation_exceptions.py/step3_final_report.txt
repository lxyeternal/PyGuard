{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling API errors, validation issues, and HTTP response errors, along with a utility function for rendering error paths.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from exception parameters such as 'msg', 'path_to_item', and 'http_resp' objects, primarily used for error message construction.",
  "sinks": "Error messages may include data from exception parameters, but these are used solely for error reporting and do not lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised with messages that incorporate data from the source parameters; the 'render_path' function formats path data into strings for error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard for API error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions and a utility function, with no external data processing, network activity, or malicious patterns. The exception classes handle error reporting with context, but do not perform any unsafe operations. The code is well-structured, uses standard Python features, and contains no obfuscation or malicious intent. The error message formatting is typical and does not pose security risks. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate error handling in an API client, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception handling module for an API client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The analysis and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
