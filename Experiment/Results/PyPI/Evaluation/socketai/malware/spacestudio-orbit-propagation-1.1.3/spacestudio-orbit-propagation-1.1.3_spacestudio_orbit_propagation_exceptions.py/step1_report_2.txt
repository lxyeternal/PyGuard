{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling API-related errors and exceptions in an OpenAPI-generated client library.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class and function definitions with no data input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no points where untrusted data is processed or outputted in a security-sensitive manner.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily raises exceptions and formats error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual behavior are present. The code is standard for an exception hierarchy and error rendering.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions for handling various API errors, including rendering detailed error messages. It includes a helper function for formatting error paths. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is present. The classes and functions follow typical patterns for API error handling, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions and error formatting for an OpenAPI client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security vulnerabilities within this fragment.",
