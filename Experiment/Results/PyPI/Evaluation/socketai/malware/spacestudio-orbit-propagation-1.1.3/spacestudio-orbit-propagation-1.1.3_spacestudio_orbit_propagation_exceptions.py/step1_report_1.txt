  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling API errors and validation issues in an OpenAPI-based API client.",
  "sources": "None; this code only defines classes and functions for exception handling and error reporting.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "None; there are no source-to-sink data flows since this is solely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious constructs; all classes and functions are standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for API error handling, including detailed messaging and response parsing. It includes classes for type, value, attribute, and key errors, as well as a base API exception with response parsing logic. No input or external data processing occurs, nor are there any apparent attempts to inject or exfiltrate data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions and classes are standard for API client error management, with no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to manage errors and exceptions in an API context.",
