  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- The code is standard, with no obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious behavior.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- Exception messages include context but do not leak sensitive data maliciously.\n- The functions and classes follow typical patterns for error management in API clients.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern could be the formatting of error messages, but these are standard and do not pose security risks.\n- The render_path function is a simple utility for formatting error paths, with no suspicious behavior.\n- Exception classes handle response errors and validation issues, with no external data manipulation.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk:** Given the nature of the code—error handling classes—it is appropriate to assign a low risk score, likely close to 0. The reports have assigned 0 or 0.5; I agree with 0, considering the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores.\n- The code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the purpose of the code.\n\n**Final note:** All reports are thorough and accurate; I see no reason to challenge their assessments.",
