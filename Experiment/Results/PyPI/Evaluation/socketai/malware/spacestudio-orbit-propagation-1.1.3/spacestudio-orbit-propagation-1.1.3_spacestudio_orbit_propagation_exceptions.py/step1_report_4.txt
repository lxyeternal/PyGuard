{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exceptions and error handling classes for an OpenAPI client, primarily to manage API response errors and type/value validation errors.",
  "sources": "Input sources include HTTP response objects and error message parameters passed to exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks are the exception messages, which include paths and data, but these are only used for error reporting, not maliciously exploited.",
  "flows": "Error information flows from HTTP responses or error parameters into exception classes, which format and propagate error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code adheres to standard error handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured exception hierarchy for API error handling, including detailed context like response headers and bodies. Render_path function formats error paths. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data manipulation is present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected; the code serves as a typical error management module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API error handling library without malicious intent or security risks. It focuses on exception definitions and formatting for API error responses.",
