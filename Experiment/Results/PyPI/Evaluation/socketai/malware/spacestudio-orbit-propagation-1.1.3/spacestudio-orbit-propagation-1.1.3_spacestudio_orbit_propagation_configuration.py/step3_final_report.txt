  "purpose": "Configuration class for an API client managing API keys, authentication, logging, SSL, and server URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters such as host, api_key, api_key_prefix, username, password, access_token, server variables, and URL templates.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include URL templates and server configuration, but no untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence URL construction and authentication headers, but no malicious data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The URL 'hhttp://spacestudio-orbit-propagation.exoops.37.59.31.223.sslip.io' contains a typo ('hhttp') which appears to be a placeholder or misconfiguration, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration utility with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The only anomaly is the malformed URL, which is likely a typo or placeholder. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is appropriate at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk score is slightly elevated (around 0.2) due to the URL typo, which could lead to misdirection but does not indicate malicious activity. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and well-structured, with the main concern being a probable typo in the URL. This should be corrected but does not constitute a security threat. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the risk score is low (~0.2). The suspicious URL warrants correction but is not malicious.",
