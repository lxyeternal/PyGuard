{
  "purpose": "The code initializes the spacestudio_orbit_propagation SDK package by importing API classes, exceptions, configuration, response handlers, and data models for satellite orbit propagation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for API classes, exception classes, configuration, response handlers, and models from the spacestudio_orbit_propagation package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified. Imports are static and do not process external input directly.",
  "flows": "The code sets up the SDK's namespace by importing modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard for SDK package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of import statements for various classes and models from the spacestudio_orbit_propagation package. It imports API interfaces, exception classes, configuration, response handling, and data models. There are no dynamic executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted inputs. The structure appears to be a typical package setup script. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The code solely imports modules to be used elsewhere in the application.",
