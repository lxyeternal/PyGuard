{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for the SpaceStudio Orbit Propagation API, importing modules, models, and exceptions for use in the SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (spacestudio_orbit_propagation.*) and internal package modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code sets up module imports and configurations without any data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. The header comments are documentation, not executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, version declarations, and documentation comments. It imports classes and exceptions necessary for the SDK's functionality. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data manipulations within this fragment. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard SDK bootstrap code with proper structure and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard initialization script for a Python SDK package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply imports necessary modules and sets up the environment for the SDK. No security concerns are identified.",
