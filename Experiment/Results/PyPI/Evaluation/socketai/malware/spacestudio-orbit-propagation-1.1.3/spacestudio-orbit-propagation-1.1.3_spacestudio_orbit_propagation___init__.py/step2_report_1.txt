  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a static setup module comprising import statements, version info, and documentation comments.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data sources.\n   - The code is purely for initializing the SDK package, importing models, exceptions, and API classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly state that the code is a standard SDK setup script with no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reports do not overlook any hidden malicious patterns; they correctly identify the absence of obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware score: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - security risk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the analysis; no malicious activity or obfuscation is present.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a malware score of 0 and security risk of 0, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is purely static, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable code structure.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as standard SDK setup code without malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores align with the detailed reasoning provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static SDK initialization module.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, safe SDK setup script with no security concerns. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
