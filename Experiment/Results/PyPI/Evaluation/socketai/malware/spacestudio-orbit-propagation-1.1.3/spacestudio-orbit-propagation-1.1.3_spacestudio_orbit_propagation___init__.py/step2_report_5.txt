  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static setup or initialization script for a Python SDK related to space orbit propagation.\n- They consistently note that the code consists solely of import statements, version info, and documentation comments.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and the security risk is also 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0 or 1), indicating strong certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any of the typical indicators of malicious behavior such as code injection, obfuscated code, or backdoors.\n- The import statements are from the package itself and are standard for SDK setup.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are comprehensive and consistent; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code is typical for SDK initialization and does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, which is justified given the static, read-only nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard SDK setup module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The provided reports are accurate and reasonable in their assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analyses and the nature of the code.",
