{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python SDK package for the Spacestudio Orbit Propagation API, importing various modules, models, and exceptions for use in the SDK.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in the code; all imports are static or predefined within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, execution of malicious code, or unauthorized actions.",
  "flows": "Since there are no input/output data flows, external data flows are absent; the code is primarily setup and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior, are present. All imported modules are part of the SDK or standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, versioning information, and a series of import statements from the 'spacestudio_orbit_propagation' package. No data processing, dynamic code execution, or external data reading occurs. The imports include models, exceptions, and API classes, which are typical for a Python SDK setup. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as an SDK setup module, performing static imports of package components without any malicious intent or security concerns. It appears safe and standard for SDK initialization purposes.",
