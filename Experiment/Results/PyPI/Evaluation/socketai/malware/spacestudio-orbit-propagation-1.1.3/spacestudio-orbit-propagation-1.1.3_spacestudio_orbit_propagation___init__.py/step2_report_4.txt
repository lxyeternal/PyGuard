  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, reasoning flaws, or security concerns.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static SDK setup module that imports various components, models, and exceptions.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network operations are present.\n- The code is consistent with standard SDK initialization patterns.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the clear, straightforward import statements.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- None of the reports identify any anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The code does not include any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- The reports are thorough in their reasoning, correctly concluding that the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The confidence level of 1.0 is appropriate given the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- There are no indications of supply chain security issues, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The code is a typical SDK setup script, performing static imports without any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code appears safe and standard.",
