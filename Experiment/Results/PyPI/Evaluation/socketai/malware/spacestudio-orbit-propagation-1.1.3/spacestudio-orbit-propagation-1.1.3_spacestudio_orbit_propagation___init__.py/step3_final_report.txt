{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an SDK setup module for the spacestudio_orbit_propagation package, importing API classes, models, exceptions, and defining version info, primarily for initializing the SDK environment.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the spacestudio_orbit_propagation package, version string, and documentation comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only performs static imports and metadata definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present; the code is purely static and standard for SDK initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script comprising import statements, version information, and documentation comments. It does not execute any dynamic logic, handle external data, or perform network operations. All imported modules are part of the package, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected, and the code aligns with typical SDK initialization patterns. The overall assessment indicates a safe, standard setup module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static SDK initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further security review or mitigation is necessary.",
