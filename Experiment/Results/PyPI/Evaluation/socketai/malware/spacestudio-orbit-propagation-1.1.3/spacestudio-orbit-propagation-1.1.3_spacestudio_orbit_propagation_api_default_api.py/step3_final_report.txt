  "purpose": "Auto-generated API client for orbit propagation, facilitating requests to compute orbit trajectories.",
  "sources": "Request parameters, headers, and optional authentication tokens.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request via call_api, response reading and deserialization.",
  "flows": "Parameters → Serialization → HTTP request → Response read → Deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API client using common patterns for request serialization, network communication, and response handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or backdoors are present. The use of response.read() is typical for consuming response streams. Authentication is handled via standard Bearer tokens, with no hardcoded secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, network-based nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated API client with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
