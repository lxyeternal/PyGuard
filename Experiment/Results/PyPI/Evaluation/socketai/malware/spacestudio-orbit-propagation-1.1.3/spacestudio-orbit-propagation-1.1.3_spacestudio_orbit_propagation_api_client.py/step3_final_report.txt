  "purpose": "A comprehensive API client library for handling requests, serialization, deserialization, authentication, and file downloads in a standard manner.",
  "sources": "Configuration inputs, request parameters, headers, body, files, and response headers (notably 'Content-Disposition' for filename extraction).",
  "sinks": "Network request execution, response data processing, file writing, and header-based filename handling.",
  "flows": "Input data (configuration, request params) → request serialization → network request → response reception → response deserialization → file saving or data return.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The handling of filename from headers is standard but should be validated in deployment; no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard API client implementation. It manages serialization/deserialization, request setup, authentication, and file download processes using common libraries and practices. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The temporary file handling and header parsing are typical, with no signs of sabotage or data exfiltration. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by the normal handling of external data and headers. The high confidence scores (above 0.9) reflect the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign API client library with no malicious, sabotage, or obfuscation elements. It adheres to standard practices, and the minimal security risk is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
