  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented HTTP client wrapper supporting SSL and proxy configurations. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk score accurately reflects potential external misconfigurations but does not indicate inherent vulnerabilities or sabotage. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts with standard security considerations."
