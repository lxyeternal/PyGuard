  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'spacestudio-orbit-propagation' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Variables containing package metadata, dependency list, and setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function that finalizes the package installation process.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variables (NAME, VERSION, REQUIRES, etc.) into setup() parameters, and then to the package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external data sources, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata and requirements, and calls setup() with these parameters. The long description is HTML-encoded but static. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. The code strictly adheres to common packaging practices without any signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign Python package setup script. There are no indicators of malicious intent, no suspicious or malicious code, and no security risks present.",
