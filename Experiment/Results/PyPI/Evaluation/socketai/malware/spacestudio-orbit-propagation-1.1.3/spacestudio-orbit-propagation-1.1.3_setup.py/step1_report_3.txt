{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'spacestudio-orbit-propagation' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata (name, version, description, dependencies, etc.) for packaging; no external or untrusted input is read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations. No data is being transmitted, processed insecurely, or stored in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining static variables to calling the setup() function with these variables; no external input influences this flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, importing setuptools and defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. All data is static and predefined; there are no inputs or outputs that could be exploited. No malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and standard for package distribution.",
