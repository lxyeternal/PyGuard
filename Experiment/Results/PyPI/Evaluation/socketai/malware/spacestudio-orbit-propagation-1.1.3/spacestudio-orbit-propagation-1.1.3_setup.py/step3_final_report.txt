  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'spacestudio-orbit-propagation'.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependency list, and description strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' using setuptools, containing static metadata, dependencies, and description strings. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or obfuscated patterns are present. The description contains HTML entities but no malicious content. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging code with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
