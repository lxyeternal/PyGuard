  "purpose": "Setup configuration and metadata for the 'spacestudio-orbit-propagation' Python package.",
  "sources": "Constants (NAME, VERSION, PYTHON_REQUIRES, REQUIRES), setup() parameters, string literals including long_description content.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The only inputs are package metadata and static strings, which are safe.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It includes package metadata, dependencies, and description. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious code injection, or suspicious logic. All strings and variables serve straightforward purposes related to package configuration. The content appears legitimate and typical for open-source package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only manages package metadata and dependencies without executing any untrusted or harmful code.",
