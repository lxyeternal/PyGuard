{
  "purpose": "This code imports a default API module from a package related to space orbit propagation.",
  "sources": "The code reads an import statement from a package module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code simply imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with a comment to ignore linter warnings. It does not process or handle any input or untrusted data. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security issues are present. The package appears to be related to an API for space orbit calculations, which seems legitimate. The code is minimal and standard for a module import, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward import of a module without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain any security risks or malware indications.",
