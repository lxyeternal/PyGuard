  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code snippet is just a simple import statement with a linter suppression comment. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities in the provided code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, minimal, and standard for a package setup. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n   These scores seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree on zero for malware and security risk, there's no need to adjust scores upward. The code is clearly benign.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code only performs an import; no malicious payload, code execution, or suspicious behavior is present. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.** It is a straightforward import statement with a linter suppression comment, typical in many projects.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.  \n- No further action needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to review additional code snippets or reports.",
