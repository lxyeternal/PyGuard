{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that imports a specific API class from a package, likely for use in a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "The only source of data input is the import statement, which loads a class from an external package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flows; the import simply loads a class for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are evident. The code contains only import statements and a comment to ignore linter warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, consisting solely of an import statement and a comment to disable linter warnings. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other potentially malicious actions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable based on this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to be a standard import statement within a larger project. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
