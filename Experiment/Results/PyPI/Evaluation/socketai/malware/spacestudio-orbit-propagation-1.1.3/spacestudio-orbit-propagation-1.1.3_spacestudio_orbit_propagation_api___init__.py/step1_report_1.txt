  "purpose": "The code imports a default API class from a module within the spacestudio_orbit_propagation package, likely to facilitate API interactions in a larger project.",

  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data manipulation or output; no execution of external code or untrusted data processing",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible as the code only contains an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a flake8 directive to ignore linting issues; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with a flake8 directive. It does not include any logic, user input, network activity, or data handling. The import appears standard for modular code organization. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple import statement for project structure. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
