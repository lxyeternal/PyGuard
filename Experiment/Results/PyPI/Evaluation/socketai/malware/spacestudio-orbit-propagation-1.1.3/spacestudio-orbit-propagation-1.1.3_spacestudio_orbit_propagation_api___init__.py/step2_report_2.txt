  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is just an import statement with a linter suppression comment. No logic, data handling, or external code execution is present.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or mistakes in reasoning; the conclusion that the code is benign is correct.  \n- **Scores:** malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature. The confidence score is 1, which is appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** The code is trivial and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only an import statement with a linter suppression.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues found; reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** All zero scores for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk, which is reasonable. Confidence is 1.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, only an import statement with a suppression comment.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues in reasoning; the conclusion is correct.  \n- **Scores:** Zero for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk, consistent with the code snippet.  \n- **Confidence:** Slightly less at 0.9, but still reasonable given the simplicity.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; no logic or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws in reasoning.  \n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk, which is appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, fitting for such a straightforward import.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import, no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Zero for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk, consistent with the code.  \n- **Confidence:** 1, appropriate for this benign code snippet.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just a benign import statement with no malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are consistent with the nature of the code snippets.  \n- **Potential risks:** None of the reports suggest any real vulnerabilities or malicious activity.  \n- **Malware and obfuscation scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Security risk:** Also 0, fitting for such simple import statements.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0, given the code's transparency.  \n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, reflecting no security threat.  \n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code snippets are standard, benign import statements with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
