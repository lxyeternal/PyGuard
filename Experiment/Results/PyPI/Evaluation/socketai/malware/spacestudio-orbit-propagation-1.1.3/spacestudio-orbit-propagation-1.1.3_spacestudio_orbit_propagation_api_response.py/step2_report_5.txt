  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's characteristics, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a generic API response data model using pydantic.\n- Fields: status_code (int), headers (optional dict), data (generic), raw_data (bytes).\n- Uses `model_config` with `arbitrary_types_allowed = True`.\n- No functions, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward and matches the described purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious code are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The use of `arbitrary_types_allowed` can weaken type validation, but this is a common pattern for flexible schemas, not malicious.\n- **Malware or malicious intent:** None detected. The code is a data schema, not executing or processing untrusted data internally.\n- **Potential security risks:** Minimal; mainly related to the flexibility introduced by `arbitrary_types_allowed`, which could be misused if data is improperly validated elsewhere, but not inherently dangerous.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports correctly identify that the code is a schema definition with no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Score Review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent across reports.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.2). Given the code's nature, a higher score isn't justified unless the configuration allows malicious exploitation, which isn't the case here.\n\n### Justifications:\n\n- The use of `arbitrary_types_allowed` increases flexibility but doesn't introduce malicious behavior.\n- No external data handling, code execution, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a data schema.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications needed; the scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n- The only consideration is that `arbitrary_types_allowed` can be misused if data validation is not handled properly downstream, but this is a known trade-off, not an attack vector.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                      |\n| Security Risk      | 0                      |\n\nThe code is a standard, benign data schema with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
