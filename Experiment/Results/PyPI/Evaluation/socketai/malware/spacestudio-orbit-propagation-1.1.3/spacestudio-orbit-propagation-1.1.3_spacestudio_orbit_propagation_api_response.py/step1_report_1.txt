{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model for deserialization and type enforcement.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries (pydantic, typing). No external input handling or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines a data structure without executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; the class serves as a schema, with data assigned externally during instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' in model_config can bypass certain pydantic type checks, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic data model for API responses using pydantic. It specifies fields for status code, headers, data, and raw bytes. There are no functions executing input/output, no data processing, or external calls. The inclusion of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' allows for flexible data types but does not enable malicious behavior on its own. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or privacy violations are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard data container.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard definition of an API response model with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted input directly and primarily serves as a data schema.",
