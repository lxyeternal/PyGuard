  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data schema for API responses with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' introduces a minor validation flexibility concern but is not inherently malicious. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk (~0.1-0.2)."
