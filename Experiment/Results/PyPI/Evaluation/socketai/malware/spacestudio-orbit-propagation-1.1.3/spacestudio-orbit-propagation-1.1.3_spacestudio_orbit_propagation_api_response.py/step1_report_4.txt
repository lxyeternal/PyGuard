{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object model for structured data handling and validation.",
  "sources": "None, the code does not read external input or data sources directly.",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data is being processed or written to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The model config allows arbitrary types, which is typical for flexible data handling but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic class 'ApiResponse' inheriting from Pydantic's BaseModel, with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. It uses type hints and Pydantic features for validation and description. The 'model_config' permits arbitrary types, increasing flexibility but not indicating malicious intent. No code execution, external calls, or data manipulation occurs. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a standard data model for API responses using Pydantic with no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward implementation intended for data validation and serialization.",
