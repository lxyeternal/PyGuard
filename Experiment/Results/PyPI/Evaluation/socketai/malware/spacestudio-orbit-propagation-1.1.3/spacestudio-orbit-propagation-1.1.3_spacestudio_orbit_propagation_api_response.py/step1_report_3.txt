  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model for deserialization and handling of HTTP responses using pydantic.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code is defining a class structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions; just data modeling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is a class definition only.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' in model_config can bypass some pydantic type checks, but this alone isn't malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a generic class 'ApiResponse' extending pydantic's BaseModel. It specifies fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. The class config allows arbitrary types, which may reduce some validation strictness but is not inherently malicious. No external data handling, network activity, or code execution present. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, straightforward pydantic data model for API responses, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' is a flexible configuration but not malicious.",
