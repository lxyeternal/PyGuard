  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a generic API response model using pydantic.\n- Fields: status_code (int), headers (optional dict), data (generic type), raw_data (bytes).\n- Uses `model_config` with `arbitrary_types_allowed = True`.\n- No functions, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is a straightforward data container.\n- The use of `arbitrary_types_allowed` can bypass some validation but is not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks in the code itself.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws identified.\n- Potential concern: allowing arbitrary types could be misused if untrusted data is deserialized without validation, but this is a common pattern and not malicious per se.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across reports. This aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** mostly 0.2 or 0.3, reflecting minimal concern due to `arbitrary_types_allowed`. This seems reasonable given the context.\n\n### Justification for higher risk or malware scores:\n- The code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The only potential concern is misuse of `arbitrary_types_allowed`, which could allow malicious payloads if data is deserialized improperly, but this is a known and documented feature, not an exploit.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or malware.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are based on weak evidence.\n- The code is a standard pattern for API response modeling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 to 0.3 is reasonable, given the potential for misuse if data is untrusted, but not inherently risky.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to `arbitrary_types_allowed`), but not a significant security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard data schema with no signs of malicious activity. The minimal risk score reflects a slight concern about flexible type handling but does not indicate a security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the risk score low unless additional context suggests misuse or malicious payloads.",
