  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object with type safety and validation using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "targets": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "The model allows arbitrary types through 'arbitrary_types_allowed', which could potentially be misused if used improperly, but in this context it is just a configuration setting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic response model for APIs using Pydantic. It specifies fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data, with appropriate type annotations and descriptions. The inclusion of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' allows for flexible data types but could be risky if misused, although this setting is a common practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard design patterns for API response modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation for modeling API responses with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
