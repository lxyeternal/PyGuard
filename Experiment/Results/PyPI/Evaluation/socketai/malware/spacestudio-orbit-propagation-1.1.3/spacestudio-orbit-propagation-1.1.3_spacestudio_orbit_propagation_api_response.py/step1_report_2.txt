{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data structure for use with pydantic validation.",
  "sources": "Input data for 'headers' (optional), 'status_code', 'raw_data', and 'data'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if 'data' is populated from untrusted sources without validation; 'raw_data' is raw bytes from HTTP response.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the model via the fields 'status_code', 'headers', 'data', and 'raw_data'. No external or untrusted data processing beyond typical data assignment is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward, with a focus on data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pydantic generic model for API responses, including status code, headers, data, and raw response body. It uses standard pydantic features and type annotations. No external or suspicious library usage, no code injection, or malicious logic present. The model configuration allows arbitrary types, which is typical for flexible data schemas but could pose security considerations if used improperly. Overall, the code appears to be a standard data container with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard data model for API responses with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves its purpose for serialization/deserialization safely.",
