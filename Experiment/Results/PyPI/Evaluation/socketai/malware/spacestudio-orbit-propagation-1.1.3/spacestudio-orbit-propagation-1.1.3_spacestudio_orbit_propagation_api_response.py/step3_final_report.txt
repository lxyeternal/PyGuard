{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic API response data model using pydantic, serving as a schema for serializing/deserializing API responses.",
  "sources": "Reads data from external API responses, including status_code, headers, data, and raw response body.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could flow into the data or raw_data fields if used improperly, but the code itself does not process or execute this data.",
  "flows": "External API response data flows into the model fields; no internal processing or data manipulation occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed = True' in model_config, which can reduce validation strictness, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, declarative pydantic model defining an API response schema. It does not contain executable logic, external calls, or data processing. The only notable aspect is the 'arbitrary_types_allowed' setting, which could potentially weaken validation if misused downstream but is not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity. The risk score is slightly elevated (~0.1-0.2) due to the configuration allowing arbitrary types, which could be misused if data validation is not properly handled, but this does not constitute a security threat in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data schema for API responses with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' introduces a minor validation flexibility concern but is not inherently malicious. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk (~0.1-0.2).",
