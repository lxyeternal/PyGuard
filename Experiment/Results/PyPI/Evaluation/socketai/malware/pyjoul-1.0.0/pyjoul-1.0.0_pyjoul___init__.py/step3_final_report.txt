{
  "purpose": "The code processes data, likely involving input/output operations, environment variables, or network interactions, typical for data handling scripts.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, file reads, network requests",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file write operations, system commands",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file system, possibly through intermediate processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls detected; no unusual code patterns or backdoors observed",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with standard data processing patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The absence of suspicious network activity or secret handling supports a benign assessment. Confidence is moderate (0.7) due to limited context, and no obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal, and the current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
