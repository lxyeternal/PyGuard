  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without seeing the actual code, this cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions (e.g., reading files, network requests, environment variables) that may provide untrusted data, but none are explicitly identifiable without the code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve executing system commands, writing to files, or network communication, but specific sinks cannot be pinpointed without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be established without the actual code. Need to identify source and sink points to trace flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without viewing the code. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious variable names, or unusual constructs can be confirmed.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to analyze source, sink, or flow patterns. Cannot evaluate code for malicious behavior or obfuscation without the code content.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to determine malicious intent or security risks due to lack of code input. No apparent suspicious activity can be confirmed at this stage.",
