  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be fully determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, possibly user input via function arguments, or files if present in the full code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or external command executions (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, parameters) through processing functions towards outputs or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with normal function definitions, variable assignments, and control structures. No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, cryptic variable names, or obfuscated sections, are present. The code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or malware like data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious in context. Without additional context, the code looks benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears standard and safe. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
