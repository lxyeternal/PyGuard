{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a setup script for a Python package, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file, and the hardcoded string assigned to 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc'.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) call which executes dynamically decoded code; potential execution of obfuscated malicious code.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' is decoded through XOR with a key derived from a large numeric string, then executed via eval(compile()) during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code that decodes and executes a string at runtime; use of eval() and compile() on decoded data; random variable names and obfuscated string; no clear legitimate reason for this dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a long obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc', decodes it via XOR with a key derived from a numeric string, then executes the decoded code dynamically using eval(compile()). This behavior suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads or unauthorized actions, especially since the code executes during package installation without any explicit validation or logging. The rest of the script is a typical setup configuration with no other suspicious activity. The obfuscation and runtime execution pattern strongly indicate malicious intent or sabotage, potentially executing hidden malicious code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated dynamic execution during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior or sabotage. The purpose appears to be to hide malicious code that is decoded and executed at runtime. This pattern is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks or hidden backdoors.",
