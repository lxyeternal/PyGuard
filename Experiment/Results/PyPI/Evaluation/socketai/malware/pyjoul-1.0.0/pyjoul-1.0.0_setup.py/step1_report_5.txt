{
  "purpose": "The script defines a Python package setup configuration and includes a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the associated decryption process are sources of potentially untrusted data that lead to code execution.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) statement executes code derived from the obfuscated string, representing a high-risk sink where malicious code can be executed.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts the obfuscated string into executable code and then executes it via eval(compile()), forming a source-to-sink flow that executes potentially malicious payload during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of an obfuscated string, a custom installation command overriding 'install', and dynamic code execution via eval(compile()) are unusual and suspicious behaviors. The decryption process hints at hiding malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a README file, and defines package metadata. The core concern is within the 'InstallCommand' class, where in the 'run' method it attempts to decrypt an obfuscated string using a XOR cipher with a large numeric key. After decryption, it uses eval(compile()) to execute the decrypted code dynamically. The obfuscated string and the decryption process are indicative of malicious intent, potentially hiding malicious code that executes during installation. The overall structure suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior behind normal setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload that decrypts and executes hidden code during package installation, posing a significant security risk. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are strong indicators of malicious intent, likely used to deliver or run malicious code stealthily.",
