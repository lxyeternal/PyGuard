{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up a Python package using setuptools, including custom installation logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings (wopvEaTEcopFEavc and iOpvEoeaaeavocp), and the path to README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic code executed via eval(compile(...)) which processes an obfuscated string. This code could potentially be malicious.",
  "flows": "The static string wopvEaTEcopFEavc is decoded with a key from iOpvEoeaaeavocp, resulting in a string executed via eval(compile()), creating a source-to-sink flow from the obfuscated string to execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated string that, after decoding, is executed dynamically. The decoding process involves XOR with a repeating key, a common technique to hide malicious code. The use of eval(compile()) on decoded code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures but includes a concealed block where a string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) is obfuscated and then decoded with a repeating key. The decoded string is then executed dynamically with eval(compile()), which is a high-risk pattern often associated with malicious payloads or backdoors. The decoding process involves XOR operations, a common method to hide malicious code. The try-except block suppresses errors, making detection of failures or malicious payloads difficult. No other suspicious activity or external network connections are present in the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a concealed, obfuscated payload that is decoded and executed at runtime, indicating malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The rest of the code appears to be standard setup code for a Python package, but the presence of this hidden dynamic execution significantly raises security concerns.",
