  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are justified and align with the observed code features. Obfuscation and dynamic execution warrant cautious handling, but no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Slightly lowering malware scores in suspicious reports could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable. Overall, the assessment is balanced and appropriate."
