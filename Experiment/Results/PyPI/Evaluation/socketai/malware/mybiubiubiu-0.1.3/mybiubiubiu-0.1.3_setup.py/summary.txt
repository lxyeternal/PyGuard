  "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data collection tool exfiltrating system info to an external server. While it lacks active malicious payloads, its behavior is privacy-invasive and suspicious. The scores in the reports are reasonable, though the malware score could be slightly lowered from 0.75 to around 0.4, with the risk score remaining high due to privacy concerns. Overall, it should be treated as potentially malicious or highly suspicious."
