{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package but includes a suspicious, encoded PowerShell command executed when a specific directory does not exist, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen call executing the encoded command; potential download or execution of malicious payloads",
  "flows": "Filesystem check triggers subprocess call; encoded PowerShell command runs in hidden window, potentially downloading or executing malicious code",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command via base64; silent exception handling; embedded suspicious URL; execution in hidden window; obfuscation techniques",
  "analysis": "The code performs a directory existence check, then executes an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags, which is suspicious. The command is base64-encoded, obscuring its intent, and is executed silently, preventing error visibility. The embedded URL ('www.esquelesquad.rip') suggests malicious C2 activity. The setup() function appears standard but is likely used as a cover or trigger for malicious payloads. The high use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL strongly indicates malicious behavior. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.85, risk ~0.85) are consistent with these indicators, reflecting a high probability of malicious activity and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior with encoded, hidden PowerShell execution and a malicious URL, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The package should be treated as malicious, and further analysis or removal is recommended.",
