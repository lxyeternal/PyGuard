Potential use of eval() or exec() functions, or network connections to suspicious domains, would be notable if present.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code begins with import statements, but some modules are imported without direct use, indicating possible obfuscation or leftover code. Data is read from environment variables or configuration files, suggesting external input sources. There are functions that perform data transformations, some of which include dynamic code execution methods such as eval(). The code includes network socket connections, but the destinations are not clearly verified, raising suspicion. Several variable names are intentionally obscure, and some code segments contain unnecessary complexity, potentially hiding malicious intent. No explicit hardcoded credentials are visible, but the obfuscation and use of eval() suggest possible malicious hiding. The overall structure lacks clear documentation and contains unusual patterns, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious design.\"),\n  \"conclusion\": \"While the code's explicit purpose is ambiguous, the presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, and unclear network interactions raises concerns about malicious behavior. The code could be designed to hide malicious activities such as data exfiltration or remote command execution. Due to these factors, it warrants caution and further analysis, especially if included in a supply chain context.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0.6,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.7\n}",
