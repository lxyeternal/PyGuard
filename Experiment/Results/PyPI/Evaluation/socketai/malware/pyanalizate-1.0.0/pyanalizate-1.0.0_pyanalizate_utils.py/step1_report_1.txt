  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific functionality within a Python package, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to the absence of code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external modules or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, file operations, network communications, or data serialization that could lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like system calls, network sockets, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors, are detectable without code content. The absence of code makes it impossible to identify such anomalies.",
  "analysis": "Due to the lack of provided code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No source, sink, or flow analysis is possible. No unusual or suspicious patterns can be observed without actual code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code content provided for a definitive security assessment. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks can be determined from an empty input. Please provide the code for a thorough review.",
