      "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and accurate; the code snippet is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary based solely on this import statement. To fully assess security implications, review the usage of 'downrun' in the larger codebase. The overall risk remains negligible."

      "conclusion": "The code is vulnerable to command injection due to unsafe handling of untrusted input in os.system. While no malware is present, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands, posing a high security risk. The scores should reflect the absence of malicious code but acknowledge the high potential for exploitation."
