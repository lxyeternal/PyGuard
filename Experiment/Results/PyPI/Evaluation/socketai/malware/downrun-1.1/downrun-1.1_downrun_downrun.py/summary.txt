  "conclusion": "The code is vulnerable to command injection due to unsafe handling of untrusted input in os.system. While no malware is present, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands, posing a high security risk. The scores should reflect the absence of malicious code but acknowledge the high potential for exploitation."
