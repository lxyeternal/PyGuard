  "purpose": "Setuptools package configuration for distributing the 'downrun' Python package.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings for package metadata (name, version, description, author info), and calls setup() with these parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input handling, network operations, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Static metadata is passed directly to setup(), no dynamic data flow or external data processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns. The description 'downloads and runs a file fr' could imply malicious intent but is only a descriptive string, not executable behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script using setuptools to define package metadata. It does not contain any runtime code, input handling, or network operations. The description string could hint at malicious intent, but as written, it is merely a string attribute. There are no suspicious code patterns, data leaks, or malicious payloads present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The descriptive string could be misleading, but the code itself is benign.",
