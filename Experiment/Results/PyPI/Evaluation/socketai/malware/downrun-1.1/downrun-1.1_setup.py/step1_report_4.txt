  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'downrun'.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, description).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or data output points.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external output.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the description fields are very brief and generic. No suspicious code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain any code that reads external inputs, executes code dynamically, or connects to external systems. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The description strings are minimal, but that alone does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
