{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If it does not exist, it executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, then proceeds with package setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; execution of subprocess with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command (remote code execution potential)",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> conditional execution of encoded PowerShell command -> package setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command triggered conditionally; silent exception handling; suspicious URL 'esquelesquad.rip' embedded in payload",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg'. If absent, it runs a hidden, base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which is likely malicious given the obfuscation and remote URL. The setup() function is wrapped in try-except to suppress errors, hiding potential issues. The encoded command and URL suggest remote payload delivery or backdoor activity. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL collectively indicate malicious intent. The silent exception handling further conceals potential failures, increasing risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated remote PowerShell command triggered under specific filesystem conditions. The behavior strongly suggests malicious activity, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The package appears legitimate on the surface but embeds malicious payloads. The overall security risk is high, and malware likelihood is very high.",
