      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated remote PowerShell command triggered under specific filesystem conditions. The behavior strongly suggests malicious activity, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation. The package appears legitimate on the surface but embeds malicious payloads. The overall security risk is high, and malware likelihood is very high."
