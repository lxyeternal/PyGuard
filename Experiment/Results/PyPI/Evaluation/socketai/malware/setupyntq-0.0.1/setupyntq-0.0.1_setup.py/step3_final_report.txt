  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to specify package information. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, obfuscated patterns, or malicious behaviors. All fields are hardcoded static strings, and there are no network operations or code execution beyond package setup. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and the code aligns with typical packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
