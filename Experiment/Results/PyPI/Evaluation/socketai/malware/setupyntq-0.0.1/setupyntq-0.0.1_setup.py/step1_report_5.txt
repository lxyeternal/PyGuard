  "purpose": "To define and configure the metadata for a Python package named 'setupyntq' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static source: the setup() function parameters and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The email address is hardcoded but not suspicious. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, license, author, email, description, long_description, keywords, and packages. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated elements, and no suspicious or malicious patterns detected. It functions solely as a package configuration script. The email address appears standard, and no other anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
