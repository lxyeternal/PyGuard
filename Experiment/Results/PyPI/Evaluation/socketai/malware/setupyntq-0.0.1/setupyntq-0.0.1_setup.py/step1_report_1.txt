{
  "purpose": "The code is used for configuring the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'setupyntq'.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; static values are used for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink as no external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration with no suspicious or unusual code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "This script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static metadata for packaging. All values are hardcoded, with no input handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The package name, version, license, author info, and description are straightforward and typical for a setup script. There are no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python packaging configuration script with no malicious intent or security concerns identified. It simply defines metadata for distributing a package named 'setupyntq'.",
