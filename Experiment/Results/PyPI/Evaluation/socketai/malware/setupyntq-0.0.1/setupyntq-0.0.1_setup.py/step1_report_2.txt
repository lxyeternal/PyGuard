  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'setupyntq'.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the script uses static strings and variables within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; no data leaks or system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. Use of a common setup pattern with static metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setuptools setup configuration defining package metadata, including name, version, license, author info, description, and package list. It does not include any code that executes external commands, writes to files outside standard package metadata, or contains obfuscated/malicious code. There are no hidden backdoors, credential leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The use of static author email and license information is typical for package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and standard Python setup script for packaging a project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
