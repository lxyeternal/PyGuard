  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and package a Python project for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading is present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or inputs are processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, such as name, version, license, authors, and description. It does not include any dynamic or obfuscated code, nor does it perform any network operations, data processing, or input handling. The use of hardcoded strings for metadata is typical for setup scripts and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
