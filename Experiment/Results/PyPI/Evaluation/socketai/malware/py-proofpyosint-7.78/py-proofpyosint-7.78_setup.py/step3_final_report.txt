{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of the 'tahg' directory; if absent, it executes a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, likely for malicious purposes. It also defines package metadata for setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; execution of subprocess with encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command; potential network activity or payload execution hidden within the command.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check ('tahg') -> if not exists -> execute encoded PowerShell command silently.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded (base64) PowerShell command executed silently; error suppression with try-except; embedded URL comment indicating external control; obfuscation and stealthy execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a filesystem check for 'tahg'. If missing, it runs a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is obfuscated and executed silently, likely to evade detection. The command's embedded URL suggests external malicious control. The setup() function appears legitimate but is exploited as a vector for malicious payloads. Error suppression may hide failures, increasing stealth. The obfuscation and stealthy execution are typical of malicious activity aimed at remote code execution or backdoor installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent, executing obfuscated PowerShell commands silently during package setup or import, with embedded external control indicators. It should be classified as malicious or highly suspicious.",
