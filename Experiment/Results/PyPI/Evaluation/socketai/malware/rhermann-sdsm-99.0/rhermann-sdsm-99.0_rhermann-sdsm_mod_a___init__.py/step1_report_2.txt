  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without seeing the actual code, this cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, reading from environment variables, file operations, or network requests (specific sources cannot be identified without code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or data leaks via print or logging statements (specific sinks cannot be identified without code).",
  "flows": "Without actual code, source-to-sink data flow cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code content; need specific code to detect unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to analyze code structure, data flows, or identify malicious or anomalous behavior. The review requires actual code snippets to evaluate security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, no definitive malicious behavior or security issues can be confirmed. More detailed code is required for a thorough assessment.",
