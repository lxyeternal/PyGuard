  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, environment variables, network or file operations, hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data to sinks like network transmission or file system, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no concrete evidence of malicious activity, with most lacking actual code snippets for analysis. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk 0.2-0.3) are consistent with their reasoning. The cautious approach in the absence of code is appropriate. Descriptions do not reveal suspicious patterns or obfuscation, and the low confidence scores reflect limited information. The assessments are conservative but justified, aligning with supply chain security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' evaluations are consistent and reasonable given the available data. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The low risk scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
