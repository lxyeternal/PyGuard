{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints a static message, serving as a benign placeholder or example.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only outputs a static message via print.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function executes a print statement without external data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, single function that outputs a static string. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no external data sources, no malicious patterns, and no obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the code shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scoring or analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
