  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints a static message, with no input or external data.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from any source.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the function only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prints a static message. All reports confirm the absence of input sources, data flows, external communications, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, benign, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores correctly reflect the harmless nature of this code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
