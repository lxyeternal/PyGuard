  "sinks": "No data outputs or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since no data input or output operations are present",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function definition that prints a static message. There are no external dependencies, no data inputs, and no code execution beyond printing a fixed string. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The simplicity suggests it's just a placeholder or demonstration function.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, trivial function with no signs of malware or security issues.",
