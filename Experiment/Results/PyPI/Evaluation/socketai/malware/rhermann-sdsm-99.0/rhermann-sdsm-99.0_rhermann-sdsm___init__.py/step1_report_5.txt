  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing or network communication based on the functions and variables used.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, user inputs, or possibly network inputs if present. Specific sources are not clearly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file I/O operations, or system commands. Exact sink functions are not explicitly identified in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network or file operations, but specific source-to-sink paths are not detailed in the code snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are visible in the provided code fragment. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with typical function definitions and control flow. Without explicit code that handles untrusted data, network connections, or system modifications, there are no apparent malicious behaviors. The absence of suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns suggests normal functionality. Due to the lack of detailed code content, some assumptions are made based on the structure and common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no evident signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, and no malicious intent is detected. Confidence is moderate due to limited visibility into the actual implementation details.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
