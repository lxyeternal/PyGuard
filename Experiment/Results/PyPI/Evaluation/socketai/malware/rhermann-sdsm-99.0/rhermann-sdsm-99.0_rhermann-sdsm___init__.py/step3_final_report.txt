  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include network communication functions, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), and data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into eval/exec, network transmission, or file operations that could lead to data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or network data flow into eval/exec or network sockets, potentially leading to malicious actions at sinks like remote command execution or data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation (high obfuscation score), dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded IPs/domains, complex control flow, or network activity suggestive of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code in Report 2 exhibits high obfuscation (0.8), uses eval/exec with untrusted data, and shows network communication, indicating likely malicious behavior. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 lack such indicators, with benign or inconclusive descriptions. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these observations. The overall assessment aligns with the suspicion that Report 2's code could perform remote code execution or data exfiltration, warranting higher malware and risk scores. The other reports show minimal or no malicious signals, justifying low scores.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 demonstrates probable malicious activity with high obfuscation and dangerous functions, justifying a malware score of 0.6, obfuscation score of 0.8, and security risk of 0.7. The remaining reports are benign, with scores reflecting low risk. Overall, the code's malicious potential is concentrated in Report 2, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
