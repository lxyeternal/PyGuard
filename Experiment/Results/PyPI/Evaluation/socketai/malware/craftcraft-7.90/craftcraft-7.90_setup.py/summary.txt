  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, with error suppression and stealth tactics indicating malicious behavior. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. Further decoding of the payload is necessary for confirmation, but current analysis warrants treating this package as potentially malicious."
