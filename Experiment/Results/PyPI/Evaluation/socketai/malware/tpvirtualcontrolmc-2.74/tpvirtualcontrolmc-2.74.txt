      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, strongly indicating malicious activity. The broad exception handling and concealment tactics further increase risk. The assigned scores (malware: 0.85, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 0.9) are justified. Immediate further analysis of the encoded payload is recommended, and the package should be flagged as potentially malicious until confirmed safe."
