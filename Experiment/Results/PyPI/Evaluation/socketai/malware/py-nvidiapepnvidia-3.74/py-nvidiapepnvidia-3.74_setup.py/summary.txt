  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, specifically executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during setup. The indicators—encoded command, silent execution, suspicious comment—justify a high malware and security risk score. It should be treated as malicious or compromised, warranting further investigation and remediation."
