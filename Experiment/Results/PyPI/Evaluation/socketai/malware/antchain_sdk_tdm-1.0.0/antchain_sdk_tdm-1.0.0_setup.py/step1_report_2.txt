{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) with collected system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get() call, sending data to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a network request during installation that transmits system information to an external server, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The URL is obfuscated and potentially used for data exfiltration. The request is embedded within a setup script, which is an uncommon and suspicious practice.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, after executing the standard installation process, collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and sends this data to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. The purpose of this network activity appears to be to gather environment details without user consent during package installation. This behavior could be part of a supply chain attack or data exfiltration effort. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials but performs network activity that could be malicious or privacy-invasive. The URL used is suspicious and may be associated with tracking or command-and-control servers. Overall, the code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data during package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unusual network request during package installation to an external server, transmitting system information. This behavior is suspicious and could be malicious, indicative of a data exfiltration or tracking attempt embedded within a setup script.",
