{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script defines package metadata and a custom installation command that performs an HTTP request during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends data (hostname, cwd, username) to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows directly into the external server via requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class performs an outbound HTTP request during installation without any user consent or obvious purpose; the URL is suspicious and may be used for data exfiltration. The code does not include any obvious documentation or justification for this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when executed, collects environment and system information and transmits it to an external server. The data collected includes hostname, current directory, and username, which could be used for reconnaissance. The external URL is suspicious, indicating potential data leakage. The code runs during package installation, which could be malicious if the user is unaware. The code does not perform any other malicious activity but secretly transmitting system data during install is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py contains a potentially malicious behavior where system information is covertly sent to an external server during installation, constituting data exfiltration. While it doesn't execute harmful payloads, the behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
