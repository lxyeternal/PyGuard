{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is intended to configure the installation of a Python package named 'antchain_sdk_tdm'.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username using socket, os, and getpass modules. It also imports the requests library to send data over the network.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call with system information parameters acts as a sink where untrusted data (system info) is sent to an external URL, potentially leaking user or system data.",
  "flows": "The code collects system info (hostname, cwd, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This flow indicates data exfiltration from the user's environment during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code embeds an external request to a suspicious domain (ceye.io), commonly used for command-and-control or data exfiltration in malicious activities. The request is made during package installation without user consent. There are no other malicious or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. After executing the standard install procedure, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username. These details are sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain. The purpose appears to be tracking or exfiltrating system info without user awareness. The code does not perform malicious actions beyond data transmission, but the behavior is suspicious for a setup script, which typically should not send data externally. The domain used for exfiltration is suspicious and commonly associated with data collection or command-and-control servers. No obfuscation or malware payload is present, but the activity itself indicates malicious intent due to unauthorized data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information during package installation, which is malicious behavior. It could be used for tracking or further malicious activities. The external request to a suspicious domain during setup indicates a security breach or malicious intent.",
