{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines package metadata and a custom installation process that collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io' with collected system data, which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from sources (hostname, cwd, username) during the custom install run, then sent via requests.get() to an external server, potentially leaking sensitive system info during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information to an external URL during package installation, which is atypical for standard setup scripts. The URL used is a suspicious domain, possibly for command and control or data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setup process by overriding the run() method of the install command. It gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity aimed at fingerprinting or spying on the user system. The data exfiltration occurs silently during package installation without user consent, which is a security concern. The URL used appears suspicious and is associated with a known data collection service, further raising suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user awareness. This constitutes a privacy violation and potential supply chain attack vector. The package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
