{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrate this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request, which is atypical and suspicious behavior for a setup script.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the system environment: socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends data over the network to an external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which acts as the sink for exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the sources (system info) through the requests.get() call, which transmits the data to the external server during the run() method of the CustomInstall class, executed during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the covert collection and transmission of system info during setup, sending data to a suspicious external domain, and overriding the standard install command without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform additional actions after standard installation. It gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This activity is not typical for setup scripts and indicates potential privacy invasion or malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The external domain ceye.io is known for data collection and testing, which raises suspicion. The network request occurs during installation, making it covert. The activity aligns with malicious supply chain tactics, such as information gathering without user knowledge. Given the behavior, the malware score should be high, and the security risk score should reflect the severity of covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. This behavior constitutes a privacy violation and potential security threat, especially if the package is distributed maliciously. The scores should be set to reflect high severity, with malware and security risk scores close to 1.0, and obfuscation remains at 0.",
