{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to package and install a Python module named 'antchain_sdk_tdm'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket (hostname), os (current working directory), and getpass (username).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via requests.get to an external URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) with collected system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "The system information (hostname, cwd, username) flows from sources to the requests.get call, which transmits data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unintended data exfiltration by sending system info to an external server during installation, which is suspicious. No other anomalies are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, upon installation, collects system details (hostname, current directory, username) and sends them to an external URL using the requests library. This behavior occurs during setup execution, not standard for typical package installation. It does not perform malicious payload execution but leaks system info, which can be used for reconnaissance or exfiltration. The URL used appears suspicious and possibly malicious or intended for tracking or information gathering. The code uses standard libraries and methods but misuses the setup process for covert data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a covert data exfiltration mechanism embedded in the setup script. While it doesn't perform direct malicious actions like executing harmful commands, sending system info during installation without user consent is suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. This could be part of a supply chain attack or malicious package intended for reconnaissance.",
