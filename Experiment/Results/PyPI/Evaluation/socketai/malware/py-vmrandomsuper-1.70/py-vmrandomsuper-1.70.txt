      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicative of malicious activity or backdoor behavior. The high obfuscation, silent execution, and external URL references justify a malware score of approximately 0.85, obfuscation score of 0.9, and security risk score of 0.85. It should be treated as malicious or dangerous until further decoding or analysis confirms safety."
