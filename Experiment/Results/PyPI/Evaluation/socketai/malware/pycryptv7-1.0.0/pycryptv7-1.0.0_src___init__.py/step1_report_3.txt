  "purpose": "This code is designed to perform malicious activities such as data theft, credential harvesting, token extraction, clipboard manipulation, system information gathering, and exfiltration via Discord webhooks. It also includes file collection, zipping, and uploading functionalities intended to extract and send user data to remote servers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user input, clipboard contents, local files (browsers, cookies, passwords, history, credit cards), process enumerations, system commands, and network responses from web requests.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into network requests (HTTP POSTs to external URLs), file writes (saving stolen data), clipboard modifications, and process termination commands. Data exfiltration occurs via Discord webhooks and file uploads to external servers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system sources (e.g., cookies, passwords, tokens, system info) through decryption and processing functions, then into data aggregation functions that compile information and send it via web requests (e.g., Discord webhook posts and file uploads). The code also kills processes, manipulates files, compresses data, and uploads results to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code hardcodes sensitive URLs (e.g., Discord webhook and exfiltration URLs), attempts to disable or bypass security measures, manipulates clipboard data to replace wallet addresses, and terminates security-related processes. It uses obfuscated or misleading variable names and includes functions that disable debugging or VM detection. There are many activities typical of malware, including data harvesting, process killing, and data exfiltration. The code also loads multiple third-party libraries, some potentially unnecessary or used maliciously.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step, the code starts by installing dependencies and setting configuration variables related to exfiltration. It gathers system info, user info, and network info. The code contains functions to decrypt stored browser data (passwords, cookies, tokens), which are then collected from multiple browsers and user profiles. It monitors clipboard activity to replace cryptocurrency addresses with predefined addresses, potentially to hijack transactions. It kills processes associated with security tools and debuggers, disables or modifies Discord protections, and extracts various user data, including cookies, passwords, history, credit cards, and Roblox cookies. Collected data is stored in files, zipped, and uploaded via webhooks or anonymous file sharing services. It uses threading to run multiple data collection routines concurrently. It also attempts to avoid VM detection and includes mechanisms to disable debugging and security processes. Overall, the code is heavily geared toward stealthily stealing user credentials, tokens, system info, and sensitive files, then exfiltrating them to external servers, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This source code exhibits clear malicious intent with functionalities for credential theft, system info exfiltration, process termination, clipboard hijacking, and data exfiltration through webhooks and file uploads. It employs obfuscation and malicious techniques such as process killing, data harvesting from browsers, and disabling security features. It is high-risk malware designed to compromise user systems and steal sensitive information, and should be classified as highly dangerous.",
