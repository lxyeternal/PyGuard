  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described behaviors with the code, and evaluate the scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code installs numerous dependencies, including requests, httpx, pyperclip, pyotp, winregistry, psutil, pycryptodome, PIL, asyncio, threading, and more—often in a suspicious manner.\n- It gathers system info, browser data (passwords, cookies, history, credit cards), Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, and screenshots.\n- It decrypts stored browser data using Windows APIs and Chrome's Local State.\n- It manipulates clipboard addresses, replacing crypto addresses with predefined ones.\n- It exfiltrates data via webhooks to \"https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen\" and uploads files to anonymous hosts.\n- It kills processes related to security tools, debuggers, and virtual machines.\n- It modifies browser and Discord files to disable protections.\n- It captures screenshots, zips data, and uploads it.\n- It performs process checks, disables VM detection, and hides itself in startup folders.\n- It uses threading for concurrent data collection.\n- It employs obfuscated variable names and redundant functions, indicating an attempt at stealth.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:** High confidence that the code is malicious, with malware, obfuscation, and high security risk.\n\n- **Malware:** 1 — The code is clearly designed for data theft, system info exfiltration, process termination, and disabling protections.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — Some variable names are misleading, but overall, the code is relatively readable.\n- **Security Risk:** 1 — The code performs extensive malicious activities, exfiltrates data, kills processes, and manipulates system files.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's scores are reasonable and justified. The confidence level is high, and behavior matches the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed analysis confirming malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware:** 1 — The behaviors are identical: credential theft, process killing, data exfiltration, disabling protections.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — Some variable names are misleading, but overall code is somewhat readable.\n- **Security Risk:** 1 — The code is highly dangerous, with multiple malicious techniques.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the code's activities. The malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:** Confirms malicious intent, with detailed analysis of credential theft, process sabotage, and data exfiltration.\n\n- **Malware:** 1 — The code is a comprehensive info stealer with anti-debugging, process killing, and data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.5 — The code shows some obfuscation, variable renaming, and redundant functions.\n- **Security Risk:** 1 — The behavior is highly malicious, with data theft, process termination, and system manipulation.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate; malware and risk are high. Obfuscation score is slightly higher, which is justified given some obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on data exfiltration, process termination, and anti-detection techniques.\n\n- **Malware:** 1 — The code is malicious, performing credential theft, system info gathering, process killing, and exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — The code employs significant obfuscation, misleading variable names, and redundant functions.\n- **Security Risk:** 1 — The behavior is highly malicious and dangerous.\n\n**Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified. Malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:** Confirms the code as a comprehensive info stealer with malware features.\n\n- **Malware:** 1 — The activities match the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — Some variable names are misleading, but overall code readability is decent.\n- **Security Risk:** 1 — The code exfiltrates data, kills processes, disables protections, and captures screenshots.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 1, which is appropriate given the extensive malicious activities.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. The code shows some obfuscation but not heavily encrypted or complex. The higher obfuscation score (0.8) in Report 4 is justified due to misleading variable names and redundant functions.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 1, justified by the code's malicious intent, data theft, process killing, and exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 1 — The code is clearly malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 — The code employs some obfuscation, variable renaming, and redundant functions, but not heavily encrypted or deeply obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** 1 — The overall risk is extremely high, involving credential theft, data exfiltration, process termination, and system manipulation.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 1.0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.6            |\n| Security Risk   | 1.0            |\n\nThis code should be classified as highly malicious, with maximum security risk, and moderate obfuscation. It warrants immediate removal and investigation.",
