  "purpose": "This code is designed to collect sensitive user data, including system information, browser credentials, cookies, tokens, wallet addresses, and screen captures, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and uploads to external services. It also includes malware-like functionalities such as process termination, persistence, and file zipping for data collection.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (e.g., COMUPTERNAME, APPDATA), system commands (e.g., wmic, powershell), user input via clipboard, and local files (browser databases, history, cookies, local state). It also reads process information, system specs, and network info.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through HTTP POST requests to webhook URLs, file uploads to external sites, and network requests to external domains (e.g., kekwltd.ru, transfer.sh). It writes collected data into files and zips them before uploading.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser data, clipboard, system commands, and environment variables into collected data structures, which are then sent via HTTP requests or written to files. Data is collected across multiple modules (browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system info, screen captures), then aggregated and uploaded. Some functions terminate processes or modify system files, creating potential backdoors.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include aggressive process killing (e.g., discord processes), persistent startup modification, code that attempts to decrypt browser data, hardcoded webhook URLs, extensive use of threading for parallel data collection, and obfuscated or misleading variable names. The code also modifies or disables certain system protections (e.g., bypassing token protections). It performs extensive collection of browser and system data, often with minimal error handling, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by actively harvesting sensitive user data: browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, and screenshots. It employs techniques to decrypt encrypted browser data, enumerate processes, and manipulate system registry. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and external file hosts, indicating data theft and unauthorized surveillance. The code attempts persistence by modifying startup folders and killing security-related processes. Its obfuscated variables and redundant functions (e.g., multiple request wrappers, stealthy threading) support malicious activity. Overall, the structure is designed for covert information collection and exfiltration, typical of malware payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a comprehensive info-stealer with features typical of malware: data harvesting, process termination, persistence, and covert exfiltration. It targets browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system details, and screenshots, then transmits this information to external servers. The combination of stealthy techniques, hardcoded URLs, and data exfiltration points strongly indicates malicious intent.",
