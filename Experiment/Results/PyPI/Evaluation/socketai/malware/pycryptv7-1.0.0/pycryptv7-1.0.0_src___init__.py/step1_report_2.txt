{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for stealing sensitive user data, including browser credentials, cookies, system information, Discord tokens, and other private files, then exfiltrating this data via webhooks or uploads to external servers. It also includes malware-like features such as process termination and process monitoring.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser storage files (Login Data, Cookies, History, Credit Cards), Discord tokens from local storage and cache, system environment variables, running processes, user input via clipboard, and captured screenshots.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through HTTP POST requests to external URLs (notably a domain 'kekwltd.ru') and file uploads to anonymous file hosting services. Screenshots and collected data are sent over network requests and saved files are uploaded.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from browser storage, clipboard, and system info is decrypted and collected, then sent via HTTP requests or uploaded files to external servers. Tokens and credentials are extracted and stored in local variables before being transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded URLs for data exfiltration, extensive use of subprocess to run commands, process termination commands, and process list checks indicating anti-debugging or anti-VM tactics. The code employs obfuscated or misleading variable names, and performs actions like killing processes and modifying browser files to disable protections.",
  "analysis": "The script loads multiple modules, including cryptography and system utilities, and contains functions to extract and decrypt passwords, cookies, tokens, and system info. It manipulates browser data, captures screenshots, and searches user directories for files with keywords suggesting sensitive data. It includes mechanisms to disable security tools and terminate processes, which are typical malware behaviors. The script dynamically retrieves and decodes encrypted credentials, then consolidates and exfiltrates this data via webhooks and file uploads. The code structure suggests an intent to avoid detection by checking system attributes, running in VMs, or manipulating process lists. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, multiple credential harvesting functions, and process-killing routines confirms malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily steal user data and system information, then exfiltrate it remotely while attempting to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, acting as a data stealer and system manipulator. It harvests user credentials, cookies, system info, and browser data, then exfiltrates this information to external servers. It employs anti-debugging measures and disables security tools. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware potential is confirmed.",
