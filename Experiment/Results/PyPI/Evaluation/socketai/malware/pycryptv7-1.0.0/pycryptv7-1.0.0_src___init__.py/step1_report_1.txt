{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for information theft and system compromise, including data exfiltration, password and cookie harvesting, browser data theft, and possibly executing malicious downloads or commands.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, environment and system APIs, browser and system data files, clipboard content, process list, network responses, and local files such as Local State, Login Data, Cookies, History, Web Data, and various browser profiles.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to a suspicious webhook URL, uploading files and data to external servers, system commands to kill processes and modify system files, decrypting and reading sensitive data from browser storage, and potentially executing or manipulating files and processes.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system and browser files (sources), decrypted and processed, then sent via HTTP POST requests or uploaded files (sinks). For example, browser passwords/cookies are read, decrypted, stored locally, and then uploaded or sent over network requests to the webhook. Process killing and registry checks are triggered based on system information. Clipboard data is manipulated to replace crypto addresses, and files are zipped and uploaded to external services.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of hardcoded URLs and webhook endpoints, multiple system and browser data exfiltration functions, attempts to kill security and debugging processes, obfuscated or misleading variable names, and malicious behavior indicators such as copying browser credentials, cookies, and history, as well as stealing Roblox cookies, and possibly executing malicious commands or downloads. The presence of code to delete system processes, modify browser files, and exfiltrate sensitive data is suspicious. Some functions are designed to hide or mask activity, e.g., hiding files in temp directories and disabling certain protections.",
  "analysis": "The script operates as a credential and data stealer, targeting browsers, Roblox, and system info, then exfiltrating data through HTTP requests to a specified webhook URL. It manipulates clipboard content to replace cryptocurrency addresses, captures screenshots, and zips data for upload. It also attempts to disable or kill security tools and process monitoring, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The code uses multiple techniques for data extraction, decryption, and exfiltration, with obfuscated and misleading variable names. The presence of malicious activity patterns and data collection from multiple sources strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info stealer targeting browser credentials, cookies, history, system info, and various cryptocurrency addresses, then exfiltrating data via HTTP requests and file uploads. It also attempts process termination and system checks to evade detection. Its behaviors align with typical malware used for credential theft, system exploitation, and privacy violation.",
