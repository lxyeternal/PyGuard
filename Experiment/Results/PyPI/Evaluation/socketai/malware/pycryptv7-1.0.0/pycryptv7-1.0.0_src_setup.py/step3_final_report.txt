  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings within the setup() call: name, version, author, author_email, description.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author string ('\"RonnieMcNutt1243\"') with embedded quotes; stylistic irregularity but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script with static metadata. No dynamic input, network activity, or code injection is present. The author string contains quotes, which is stylistically odd but harmless. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. Malware scores are zero; security risk scores are negligible. The minor anomaly in the author string does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and typical for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The unusual author string is a stylistic concern, not a security risk. The scores assigned across reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
