  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pycryptv7' Python package, defining metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources; static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; purely metadata declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Author name contains a suspicious string ('RonnieMcNutt1243') which could be an alias or for obfuscation, but no direct malicious activity is evident. Description is enclosed in quotes, which is acceptable but unusual formatting is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup configuration defining package metadata. No external input, no dynamic code, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The author name appears unusual but not inherently malicious. No indications of code injection, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual author name does not impact security but may warrant further context if suspicious.",
