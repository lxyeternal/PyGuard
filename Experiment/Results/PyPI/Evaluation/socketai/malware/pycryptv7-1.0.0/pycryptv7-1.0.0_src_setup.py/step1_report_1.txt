{
  "purpose": "To define the metadata and configuration for the 'pycryptv7' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data defining package name, version, author, author email, and description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only processes static, hardcoded metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Author name appears as a suspicious or potentially joke username, but this alone is not malicious. The description string is enclosed in quotes unnecessarily, but that is benign. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools.setup to configure package metadata. All values are hardcoded strings, with no input handling or external data processing. The author name and description contain quotation marks, which are syntactically harmless but stylistically unusual. No indications of malicious behavior or suspicious activity were found. The code appears to be a standard setup script with minor formatting irregularities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. Minor stylistic issues do not affect security. No anomalies suggest malicious behavior.",
