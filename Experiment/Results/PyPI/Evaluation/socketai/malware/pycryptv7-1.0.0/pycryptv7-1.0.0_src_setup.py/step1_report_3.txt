  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pycryptv7' Python package, intended for package distribution.",
  "sources": "No direct data inputs; metadata provided via static strings in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no external connections or data processing observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Author name includes unusual characters ('\"RonnieMcNutt1243\"'), but this appears as a string value, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It lacks any code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated content. The author string includes quotes within the string, which is unusual but harmless. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code adheres to typical setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package metadata for distribution.",
