  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script ('my_script.py') using the system shell.",
  "sources": "os.system() call that executes 'python my_script.py'",
  "sinks": "os.system() execution leading to command execution in the shell",
  "flows": "Input to os.system() -> Shell command execution",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands; simple script invocation",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a main() function that calls os.system() to run 'python my_script.py'. This is a straightforward script execution pattern. Since the command is hardcoded and does not incorporate untrusted input, it does not exhibit typical malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code could potentially be used maliciously if 'my_script.py' contains harmful code, but within this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script solely executes another Python script using a system call. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware within this snippet. However, if 'my_script.py' is malicious, this code could indirectly facilitate malicious activity, but based on this code alone, it is benign.",
