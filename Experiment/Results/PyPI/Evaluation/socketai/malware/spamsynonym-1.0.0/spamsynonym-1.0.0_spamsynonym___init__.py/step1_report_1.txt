{
  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script named 'my_script.py' via the operating system command.",
  "sources": "The call to os.system with the string 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "os.system command execution potentially executing arbitrary commands if the input string is manipulated.",
  "flows": "User or environment input could influence the string passed to os.system, leading to code execution if misused.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a fixed string, which appears normal; no input sanitization or dynamic input used here. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and defines a main function that calls os.system with a fixed command to run 'my_script.py'. There are no inputs, user data, or environment variables influencing this command. The script is straightforward and does not include any hidden or malicious behavior. The only potential security concern is if 'my_script.py' itself is malicious, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply runs another script using a fixed command without any user input or dynamic data, posing minimal security risk. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain attacks based solely on this snippet.",
