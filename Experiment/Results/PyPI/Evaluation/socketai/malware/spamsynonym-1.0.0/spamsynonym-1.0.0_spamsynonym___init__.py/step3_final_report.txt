{
  "purpose": "This code executes an external script 'my_script.py' using a static system call.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only contains a fixed string in os.system()",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes 'python my_script.py', which could run malicious code if the script is compromised",
  "flows": "The code flows from the main() function to os.system() with a fixed command, leading to execution of 'my_script.py'",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no dynamic command construction, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines main() which calls os.system() with a static string, and executes main() if run directly. The command is fixed and not influenced by user input, reducing risk. No obfuscation or malicious code is present within this snippet. The security concern depends on the external 'my_script.py', which is outside the scope. The code itself is benign, straightforward, and does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary risk lies in the external script 'my_script.py'. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, reflecting reliance on external code. The reports' assessments and scores are consistent and appropriate.",
