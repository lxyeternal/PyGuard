{
  "purpose": "The code executes another Python script named 'my_script.py' using the operating system command.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it simply calls os.system with a fixed command string.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call is a sink where the command string is executed in the shell.",
  "flows": "The program flow involves calling main(), which then executes os.system with a static command to run 'python my_script.py'.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The command executed is static and directly calls a script. No input validation or dynamic command construction is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, defines a main() function that executes a shell command to run 'my_script.py' via os.system, and calls main() if the script is run directly. The command is hardcoded and does not incorporate user input or untrusted data, reducing risk. However, using os.system can be risky if the command string is dynamically constructed from untrusted sources, which is not the case here. The code appears straightforward and does not contain malicious intent or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes a static command to run another script, which by itself does not indicate malicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious activity within this code fragment. It is a simple wrapper to invoke another script.",
