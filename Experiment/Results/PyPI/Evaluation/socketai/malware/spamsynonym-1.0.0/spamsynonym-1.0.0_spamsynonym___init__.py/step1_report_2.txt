{
  "purpose": "The code runs an external Python script named 'my_script.py' using the system shell.",
  "sources": "The call to os.system() with the string 'python my_script.py'",
  "sinks": "Execution of external command via os.system() which can execute arbitrary commands if the input is manipulated",
  "flows": "The code executes the command 'python my_script.py' when run, directly invoking an external script",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with a fixed string; no input sanitization or dynamic command construction; minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports os, defines main() which calls os.system() to execute a script. There are no user inputs, no dynamic command execution, and no obfuscation or hidden code. The script executed ('my_script.py') is external, and without its content, we cannot evaluate its behavior. The code does not contain malicious logic by itself but relies on the external script. The use of os.system() instead of more secure subprocess modules could be considered a potential security concern if command strings were constructed dynamically, but here, it is a static command.",
  "conclusion": "This code executes a fixed external Python script using os.system(). It does not include malicious behavior by itself, but it could be used maliciously if 'my_script.py' is malicious. The code itself is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
