      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and potentially executing external code without validation, with filenames and URLs strongly indicating remote access malware. The high malware score of 1 and security risk score of 1 are appropriate, and the obfuscation score remains 0. This package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly."
