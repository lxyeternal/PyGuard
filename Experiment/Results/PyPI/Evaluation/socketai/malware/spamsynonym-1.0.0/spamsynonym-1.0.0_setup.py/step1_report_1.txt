{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that downloads and executes an external Python script from the internet during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089855354449432596/rat.py' in the CustomInstallCommand class, which fetches a remote Python script.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded 'rat.py' file is saved locally and can potentially be executed via the 'spamsynonym.rat:main' entry point, which could run malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code retrieves remote code from the URL (source), saves it locally, and likely executes it via the 'spamsynonym.rat:main' script (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The script automatically downloads and writes an external script during installation without verification, which is suspicious. The URL points to a Discord CDN, a common obfuscation or hosting choice for malicious payloads. The 'rat.py' filename suggests remote access trojan behavior. Installing dependencies dynamically without validation is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install command that, during installation, downloads a Python script ('rat.py') from an external URL and saves it locally. It then installs dependencies ('requests', 'pycryptodome') if missing. The entry point 'spamsynonym.rat:main' indicates that the package may execute the downloaded script upon invocation, which could be malicious. The use of a Discord CDN URL for fetching code, automatic download during setup, and the naming conventions are all suspicious indicators. No validation or integrity check of the downloaded code is performed. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malware delivery, likely to perform malicious remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and potentially executing a remote script during installation, with no safeguards or validation. The URL and filename strongly suggest malicious intent, indicating a high security risk.",
