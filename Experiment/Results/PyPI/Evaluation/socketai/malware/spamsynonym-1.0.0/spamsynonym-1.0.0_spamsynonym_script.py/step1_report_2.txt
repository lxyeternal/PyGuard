  "purpose": "Execute another Python script ('my_script.py') using a system call.",
  "sources": "os.system('python my_script.py')",
  "sinks": "os.system call execution, which runs an external script with system privileges",
  "flows": "Input from the script or environment (if any) is indirectly executed via the system call",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to run an external script, which can be manipulated if 'my_script.py' is replaced or altered; no validation or sanitization present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and defines a main function that invokes os.system to run 'python my_script.py'. This pattern can be risky if 'my_script.py' is replaced or modified maliciously, but in isolation, it merely executes another script. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The use of os.system instead of subprocess could be considered less secure, but it is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply runs an external script via a system call, which can be a security concern if 'my_script.py' is malicious or replaced by an attacker, but there is no direct malicious intent or malicious behavior evident in this code snippet itself. It is a potential security risk due to reliance on external scripts, but no malware or malicious activity is detected within this code.",
