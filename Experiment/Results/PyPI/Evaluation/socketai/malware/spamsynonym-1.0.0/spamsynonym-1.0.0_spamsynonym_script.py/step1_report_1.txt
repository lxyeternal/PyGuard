{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script named 'my_script.py' using the operating system's command line interface.",
  "sources": "The call to os.system with a fixed string command 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call which executes an external command based on a static string; if the string were dynamic, it could be a vulnerability, but here it is static.",
  "flows": "The script calls os.system with a hardcoded command, which could execute another script; no untrusted input appears to influence the command.",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system with a hardcoded command; no dynamic input or user data involved. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a main() function that calls os.system to execute 'python my_script.py'. Since the command is static and does not incorporate any user input or external data, there is no apparent data leakage, injection, or malicious command execution. The code is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious operations or contain obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a simple, static external script invocation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign with no malware or security concerns based on this code snippet.",
