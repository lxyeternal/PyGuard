  "purpose": "Execute another Python script ('my_script.py') using a system call.",
  "sources": "os.system('python my_script.py')",
  "sinks": "os.system call potentially executing arbitrary commands or scripts",
  "flows": "Input (command execution) originates from the script and executes 'python my_script.py' via the operating system",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system without input validation; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; straightforward command execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that calls os.system to run 'python my_script.py'. This is a direct system call executing a script. Since the script name is hardcoded and no user input is involved, the risk of malicious command injection from untrusted input is minimal. However, using os.system to run scripts can be dangerous if the command string is dynamically generated or comes from an untrusted source, which is not the case here. The code itself does not contain malicious behavior or backdoors; it simply executes another script. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. Overall, the code appears straightforward and benign, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple script runner that executes 'my_script.py'. There are no malicious behaviors detected; it appears to be a normal utility script. However, reliance on os.system for script execution can be risky if expanded or modified in the future, but in its current form, it is benign.",
