{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script ('my_script.py') using the operating system command line.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing directly from untrusted input; it uses a fixed command string.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a command that could potentially run arbitrary code if 'my_script.py' is malicious or altered.",
  "flows": "There is a direct flow from the code calling os.system to executing 'python my_script.py', which may run any code contained within that script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os, defines a main function that calls os.system with a fixed command to run 'my_script.py'. When executed, it runs that script in a subshell. Since the command is hardcoded and does not include external untrusted input, it reduces risk of injection. However, if 'my_script.py' is malicious or compromised, this code will execute it without verification. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and executes another script via os.system. While it does not contain malicious code by itself, it poses a security risk if 'my_script.py' is malicious or altered, as it will be run without validation. No malware or obfuscation detected in this fragment, but reliance on external script integrity is a concern.",
