{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script 'my_script.py' using the operating system shell.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment via the import os and the os.system call that executes 'python my_script.py'.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call is a sink where untrusted input could potentially be executed, but in this code, it executes a fixed string command.",
  "flows": "The code flow is from the import os, to calling os.system with a fixed command 'python my_script.py'.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses os.system with a fixed command, which is straightforward and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No input validation or dynamic command execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the os module and defines a main function that calls os.system with a static string to execute another Python script. The command executed is fixed and hardcoded, indicating no dynamic or untrusted input is involved. The code's purpose appears to be to run another script, which could be benign or malicious depending on the content of 'my_script.py', but within this code itself, no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious commands, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply runs a specified Python script using os.system. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, assuming 'my_script.py' is safe, but executing external scripts always carries a risk if the content is malicious.",
