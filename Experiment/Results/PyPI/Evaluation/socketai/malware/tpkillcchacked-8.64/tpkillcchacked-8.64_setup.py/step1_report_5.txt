{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration and execute potentially malicious code if a specific file does not exist.",
  "sources": "Reading the filesystem to check for 'tahg'; reading environment and system variables; executing subprocess commands with encoded PowerShell script.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution with encoded PowerShell command that may run arbitrary code; reading filesystem; package setup process (less concerning).",
  "flows": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' -> if not exists, run encoded PowerShell command -> continue with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command that executes hidden commands; attempt to download or execute external code; the code appears obfuscated and suspicious. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is often used to hide malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script first checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg'. If absent, it executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command that runs silently in the background, likely to download or execute remote malicious code. The setup() function appears normal, but the preceding malicious conditional block is suspicious. The try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding failures. The use of encoded PowerShell and filesystem check strongly suggests malicious intent to execute hidden code. The rest of the setup code appears benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden, encoded PowerShell command intended to run covertly, likely to download or execute malicious payloads, representing a high security risk. The rest of the code appears standard for package setup. Overall, this package exhibits malicious behavior with a high malware score.",
