  "malware_score": 0.8,
  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.85,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated, encoded PowerShell command triggered conditionally, with error suppression and hidden execution. While the actual payload remains unknown without decoding, the pattern aligns with common malicious tactics. The high scores are justified, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for definitive assessment."
