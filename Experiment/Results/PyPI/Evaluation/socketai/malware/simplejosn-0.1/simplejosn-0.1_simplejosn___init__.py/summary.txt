  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code's obfuscation and dynamic features suggest potential concealment but lack definitive malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with the primary concern being obfuscation rather than confirmed malware. Further analysis could lower the malware suspicion if no malicious activity is observed in controlled testing."
