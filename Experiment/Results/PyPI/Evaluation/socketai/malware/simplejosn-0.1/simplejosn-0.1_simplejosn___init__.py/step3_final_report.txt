  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data read operations, environment variables, network connections, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission or file writes, possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (score 0.8), dynamic code execution, complexity without clear purpose, potential concealment of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and signs of dynamic execution, raising suspicion but no explicit malicious activity is confirmed. The high obfuscation score (0.8) and moderate malware suspicion (0.3) are justified given the context. Other reports show straightforward, non-obfuscated code with no malicious indicators. The suspicion in Report 1 warrants cautious scoring, but without concrete malicious actions, the risk remains moderate. The overall assessment aligns with the scores, emphasizing obfuscation as the primary concern rather than confirmed malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code's obfuscation and dynamic features suggest potential concealment but lack definitive malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with the primary concern being obfuscation rather than confirmed malware. Further analysis could lower the malware suspicion if no malicious activity is observed in controlled testing.",
