  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script that performs specific tasks, possibly related to data processing or utility functions. Without further context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external modules. There are no obvious network input streams or file reads explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands if invoked. Specific dangerous functions are not explicitly evident from the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or function arguments through processing functions, potentially reaching output or system interaction points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates that the code uses typical Python constructs without suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. Usage of external libraries seems benign. The code does not perform suspicious network activity or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears to be a regular Python utility or processing script with no malicious intent.",
