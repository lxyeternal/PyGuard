      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, with heavy obfuscation, system privilege escalation, covert file and system modifications, and dynamic package management. It should be classified as malware with a malware score of 0.9, an obfuscation score of 0.9, and a security risk score of 0.9. It is highly dangerous and should not be executed or distributed."

      "conclusion": "The code's obfuscation and dynamic features suggest potential concealment but lack definitive malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with the primary concern being obfuscation rather than confirmed malware. Further analysis could lower the malware suspicion if no malicious activity is observed in controlled testing."
