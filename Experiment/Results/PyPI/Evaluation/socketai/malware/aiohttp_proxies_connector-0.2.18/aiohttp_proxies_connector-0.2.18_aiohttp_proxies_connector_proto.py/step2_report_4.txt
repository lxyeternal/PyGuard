  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions, scores, and reasoning with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Recognizes standard SOCKS4/5 implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as a standard SOCKS proxy implementation. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are detected. The low risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard protocol adherence, no malicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code's structure. No suspicious logic or hidden payloads. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces the view that the code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, aligns well with the code. Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable given the straightforward implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the absence of hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation. Notes standard protocol implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate assessment; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code and other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code handles network connections, authentication, and address resolution per protocol, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly zero across all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1-0.2). Given the code's nature, these are appropriate, reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4/5 proxy clients using asyncio.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious logic.\n- Error handling and protocol adherence are appropriate.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low; typical for proxy client code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe consistency across multiple independent assessments confirms the code's benign nature. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
