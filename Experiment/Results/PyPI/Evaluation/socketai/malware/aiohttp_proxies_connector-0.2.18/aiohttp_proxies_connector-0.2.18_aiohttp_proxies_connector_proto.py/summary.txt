  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments, assuming proper input validation and security practices are followed."
