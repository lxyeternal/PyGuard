  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers using asyncio.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.\n- The logic aligns with protocol specifications.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or covert channels are detected.\n- Error handling appears appropriate.\n- The code relies on user-provided parameters and standard libraries.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the code's transparency.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review per report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & sources/sinks/flows:** Correctly described.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The reviewer states no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The low risk score reflects minimal security concern, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & sources/sinks/flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Also accurate. The code appears legitimate and standard.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & sources/sinks/flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage; standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. Slightly lower risk score aligns with the absence of concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & sources/sinks/flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code remains within expected proxy client behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & sources/sinks/flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity, no suspicious data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the overall analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, matching the transparent code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate given the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **My expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — low, considering the code handles proxy connections securely without evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, well-justified, and accurately reflect the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type   | Estimated Value |\n|--------------|-----------------|\n| Malware      | 0               |\n| Obfuscated   | 0               |\n| Security Risk| 0.1             |\n\nThe code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
