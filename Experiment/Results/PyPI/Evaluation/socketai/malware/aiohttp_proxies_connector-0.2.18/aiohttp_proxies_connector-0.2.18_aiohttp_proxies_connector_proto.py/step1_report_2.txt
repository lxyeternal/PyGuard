{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling applications to establish proxied network connections.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, and optional credentials provided via class parameters; address resolution occurs via getaddrinfo; data received from network socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets, including connection requests, authentication credentials, and address requests; received data is processed for connection setup.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, credentials) flows into connection and authentication methods, which construct and send protocol-specific requests; responses from the proxy server are read and interpreted to establish the connection.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration mechanisms. It uses standard protocol implementation for SOCKS proxies. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation are detected. No cryptic or misleading variable names; no dynamic code execution or eval calls. The import statements are for standard libraries and specific error classes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio for asynchronous network operations. It includes functions for address resolution, connection negotiation, and error handling. The error handling is comprehensive, and the flow appears consistent with typical proxy client behavior. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities are present. No suspicious external communications or code that could facilitate covert operations are detected. The structure and logic are clear and aligned with standard proxy connection procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy clients without any malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. It does not perform any suspicious actions such as data theft, system intrusion, or covert communication. The logic is straightforward, adhering to protocol specifications, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malware. Overall security risk is minimal.",
