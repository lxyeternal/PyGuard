{
  "purpose": "This code provides asynchronous SOCKS proxy client implementations (SOCKS4 and SOCKS5) for establishing proxy connections, including handling authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from network sockets (_loop.sock_recv, _loop.sock_recvfrom), configuration parameters (host, port, credentials), and DNS resolution (_resolve_addr).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over network sockets (_loop.sock_sendall), including proxy negotiation requests, authentication data, and connect commands.",
  "flows": "Input data from user or DNS resolution flows into socket send commands for proxy negotiation and connection requests; network responses flow back into the code for validation and further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; code performs standard proxy negotiation procedures. The code does not perform any suspicious data exfiltration, system modifications, or external connections beyond intended proxy operations. Exception handling is standard for network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements typical proxy client logic for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 with standard address resolution, authentication, and connection procedures. No suspicious or malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or unauthorized access, is evident. It handles errors appropriately and maintains non-blocking socket operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern could be if malicious inputs are provided externally, but the code validates and handles errors appropriately. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate implementation of proxy connection logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard asynchronous SOCKS proxy client implementation with no detectable malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected network operations securely and correctly. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
