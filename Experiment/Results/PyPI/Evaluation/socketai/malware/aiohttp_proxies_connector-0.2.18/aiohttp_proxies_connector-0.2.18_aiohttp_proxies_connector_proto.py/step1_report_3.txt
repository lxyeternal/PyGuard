{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling an asynchronous connection to proxy servers and routing traffic through them.",
  "sources": "Reads include: user input parameters (host, port, username, password), address resolution via getaddrinfo, socket operations (sock_connect, sock_sendall, sock_recv), and network data received from proxy servers.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to proxy servers via _send(), which transmits SOCKS protocol negotiation requests and commands. Receives data from the proxy server for responses and connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user parameters and address resolution flow into proxy negotiation and connection requests. Responses from proxy servers are processed to confirm successful negotiation and establish the connection. No data flows directly from untrusted external sources outside initial parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. Use of standard libraries and protocols. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unnecessary dynamic execution. Error handling appears standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with appropriate validation, error handling, and asynchronous socket operations. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, system modification, or covert channels. All network operations are standard for proxy client implementations. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code relies on user-provided parameters for connection details, which are properly handled. No signs of malware, unauthorized data access, or security bypass mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client wrapper for asyncio, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected proxy negotiation and connection operations without suspicious activity. Overall, it is safe based on the provided code.",
