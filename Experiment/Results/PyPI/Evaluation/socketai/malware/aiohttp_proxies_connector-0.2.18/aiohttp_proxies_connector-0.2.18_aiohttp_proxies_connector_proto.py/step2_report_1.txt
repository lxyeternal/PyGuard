  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, the reasoning provided, and the scoring assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious or suspicious activity, citing standard SOCKS proxy implementation, appropriate error handling, and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Given the code is a typical proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, these scores seem reasonable.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score could be slightly higher, perhaps 0.3, considering potential misuse of proxy features, but as per the review, the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard implementation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the previous report, the scores are appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is described as a straightforward, standard SOCKS proxy client with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification:** The lower risk score reflects confidence in the code's benign nature.\n- **Recommendation:** The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, standard implementation with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with prior assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low but not zero risk, acknowledging that proxy code can be misused if deployed maliciously, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, but considering potential misuse of proxy features, a minimal risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content and analysis. No significant adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1             |\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
