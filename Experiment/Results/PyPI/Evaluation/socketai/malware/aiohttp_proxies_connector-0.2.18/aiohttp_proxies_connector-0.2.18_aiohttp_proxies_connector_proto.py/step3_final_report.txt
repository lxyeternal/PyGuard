  "purpose": "Implementation of asyncio-based SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers, facilitating proxy negotiation, address resolution, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Host and port parameters for proxy and destination; network socket operations for connection, data sending, and receiving.",
  "sinks": "Network socket send and receive functions; address resolution functions; potential data flow from user input to network transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> address resolution -> socket connection -> SOCKS negotiation -> data transmission over socket.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Protocol adherence appears correct.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients using asyncio. It handles connection setup, authentication, and address resolution according to protocol specifications. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Error handling is appropriate, and the code is transparent with no obfuscation. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) accurately reflect the benign and standard nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correct. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments, assuming proper input validation and security practices are followed.",
