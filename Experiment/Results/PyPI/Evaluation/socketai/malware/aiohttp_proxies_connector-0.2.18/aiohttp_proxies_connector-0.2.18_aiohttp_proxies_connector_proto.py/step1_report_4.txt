{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols to facilitate proxy connections asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames, ports, user credentials, and socket address resolution; socket communication occurs during negotiation and connection phases.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over the network includes proxy negotiation commands and connection requests; potential untrusted data could flow through socket operations during negotiation or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames and credentials flow into socket address resolution and authentication steps, then into connection requests, which are sent through socket send functions; received responses are checked for errors and success signals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; the code handles typical SOCKS proxy negotiation with no unusual or suspicious code constructs; error handling appears standard; no obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio for asynchronous socket operations. It resolves hostnames, performs authentication, and manages connection negotiation per protocol specifications. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoor functionalities. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident. The code's structure and content are consistent with legitimate proxy handling functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous Python applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security-critical vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is low.",
