{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network communication, including negotiation, connection, and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Reads include user input for host, port, username, password, and address resolution; data from socket reads during negotiation and communication.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to sockets during connection negotiation, authentication, and data transmission; receives data from sockets during these processes.",
  "flows": "Sources (host, port, credentials) flow through address resolution, SOCKS negotiation, and authentication routines, reaching sinks where data is sent over sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic. All functions appear standard for SOCKS proxy handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a typical implementation of SOCKS proxy protocols (version 4 and 5) with asynchronous socket handling using asyncio. It includes address resolution, authentication (with username/password options), and connection setup routines. No hardcoded secrets or malicious data manipulations are present. Error handling is appropriate, raising specific exceptions for connection failures and protocol errors. The code does not send or receive any unauthorized data or perform malicious actions outside expected proxy behavior. No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code appears legitimate and intended for proxy communication purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It securely handles network connections, address resolution, and negotiation without suspicious activity.",
