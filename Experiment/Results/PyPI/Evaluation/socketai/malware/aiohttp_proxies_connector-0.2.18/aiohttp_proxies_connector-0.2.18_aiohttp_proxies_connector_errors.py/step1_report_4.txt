  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS and proxy error handling",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading points present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leakage points present",
  "flows": "No data flows, source-to-sink paths are absent",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains class definitions for exceptions without any suspicious logic or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, used for error handling in network proxy contexts. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns are present. The classes are straightforward and serve as error identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional for exception handling and does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and typical for error management in network proxy modules.",
