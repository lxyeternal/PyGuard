{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that serve as exception types, no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; exception classes do not handle untrusted data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from built-in exception types. It serves as a structured way to manage error conditions in other parts of a larger system. There are no functions, input/output operations, or logic that could be exploited. The code appears to be purely structural and intended for error handling, with no malicious behavior or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain suspicious code segments.",
