  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, network communication, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as error categorization.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they accurately describe the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies noted.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves a typical purpose in error handling for network modules. No further action or concern is warranted.",
