  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as solely defining custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data input/output, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly for structured error handling within a larger system.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The code provided matches the descriptions: it only defines exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as part of an error management framework.\n\n**Error, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n- The class hierarchy appears correct.\n- No issues with the code as provided.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Confidence is high (1), reflecting the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly assume no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no data leaks.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are based on assumptions; all are factual based on code review.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and serves as a foundational error handling component.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final assessment:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
