  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions; no input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or execution path; only class inheritance hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various SOCKS proxy-related exceptions, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There is no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code serves as a structural component for error handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. The current scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
