  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data processing, input/output, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be purely structural, for error handling in a larger system.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious behavior:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are observed.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Security risk:**\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes, the security risk is minimal.\n   - No data leaks, no execution of untrusted code, no network activity.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which seems justified.\n\n4. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - Given the nature of the code, these scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports correctly state that there are no vulnerabilities, no data leaks, and no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Errors or flaws in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - They correctly identify the code as harmless and purely structural.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is standard, straightforward exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The reports are accurate and do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Based on the code provided, I would agree with the current scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves a clear purpose in error handling. It presents no security risks or malicious intent. The current scoring and reasoning are appropriate.",
