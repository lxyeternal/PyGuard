  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n- No data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are indicated.\n\nConclusion: The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of data flow, input/output, or suspicious patterns.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. Scores assigned:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty, which is appropriate.\n\n4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports agree that there is no malicious behavior or security risk, and the code is purely class definitions, risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No evidence suggests potential vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n5. Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or code execution.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n- The malware score should be 0.\n\n6. Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume that exception class definitions are harmless, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about hidden behavior or obfuscation are made; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n7. Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
