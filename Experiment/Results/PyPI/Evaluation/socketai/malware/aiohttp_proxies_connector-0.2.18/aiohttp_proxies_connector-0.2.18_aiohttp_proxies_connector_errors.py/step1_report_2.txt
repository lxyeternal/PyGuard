{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads; solely class definitions",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output operations; code only defines exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes. These classes are used to represent specific error conditions related to SOCKS proxy operations and connection issues. There are no data input/output operations, no network communication, and no logic that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to typical exception class definitions. There is no indication of hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. Overall, it appears to be a standard error handling setup for a SOCKS proxy library or module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining custom exception classes for error handling and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, harmless part of a larger application or library.",
