  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nThe code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning.**  \nAll reports uniformly state that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. Their reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned.**  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores if any.**  \nSince the code contains no dynamic behavior, no data handling, and no network operations, there's no justification for increasing risk scores.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities.**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error classification, with no vulnerabilities or exploitable logic.\n\n**Step 6: Check for consistency between reports and code.**  \nAll reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the code's nature, I agree with the reports' assessments. There are no issues to escalate or flag as security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\nThe code is benign, purely structural, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
