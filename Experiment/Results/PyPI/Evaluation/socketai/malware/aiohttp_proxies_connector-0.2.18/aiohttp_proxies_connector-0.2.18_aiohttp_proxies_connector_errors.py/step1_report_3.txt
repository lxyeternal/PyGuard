{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "None; exception classes are for error signaling only and do not process data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes. There are no functions, data processing, external data inputs, or dynamic code execution. The exception classes serve to categorize errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and authentication. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident from these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe set of custom exception classes for error handling in SOCKS proxy operations. It presents no malware, security risks, or obfuscation. The implementation appears benign and intended for structured error reporting.",
