  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS protocol errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; all classes are definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are static definitions with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions that inherit from standard Python exceptions. There are no input/output operations, no data handling, and no logic beyond class inheritance. No potentially malicious or suspicious code elements are present, nor are there any behaviors that could facilitate malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling in SOCKS protocol implementations. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security threats.",
