{
  "purpose": "This code facilitates creating network connections via SOCKS proxies, including parsing proxy URLs and establishing socket connections.",
  "sources": "Parsing proxy URL in parse_proxy_url(), user inputs in function parameters (socks_url, host, port), and optional environment data in kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment in sock.connect() and asyncio.open_connection(), creation of network connections via loop.create_connection().",
  "flows": "Source: parse_proxy_url() or function parameters → create_socket_wrapper() → sock.connect() or loop.create_connection() → destination host and port.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; no suspicious dynamic code execution; proxy configuration is flexible but benign. No unusual behaviors or code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code parses user-supplied proxy URLs, constructs SOCKS proxy socket wrappers, and establishes network connections through them. It validates host and port inputs, manages optional proxy credentials, and utilizes asyncio for asynchronous connections. No suspicious data leaks, malicious payloads, or backdoors are evident. The use of proxy configuration may facilitate privacy or circumvention, but does not imply malicious intent. The code appears well-structured with standard patterns for proxy connection handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate network connection tasks with support for SOCKS proxies. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks based on the provided content. It appears safe and consistent with typical proxy connection utilities.",
