  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and establish asynchronous network connections through these proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing, user info extraction, host and port validation, socket wrapper creation, and input parameters for connection functions.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio connection creation, and data flow through proxy sockets.",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL or parameters -> parse_proxy_url() -> create_socket_wrapper() -> connect() -> asyncio.open_connection() or create_connection()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution; standard URL parsing and socket handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard proxy connection setup with validation and error handling. It correctly restricts to SOCKS proxies, handles credentials securely, and manages asynchronous connections. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The use of unquote on URL user info is typical, though it could be exploited if maliciously crafted, but this is common practice. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and align with typical network utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connection management. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering potential misuse of proxy inputs but not an inherent flaw.",
