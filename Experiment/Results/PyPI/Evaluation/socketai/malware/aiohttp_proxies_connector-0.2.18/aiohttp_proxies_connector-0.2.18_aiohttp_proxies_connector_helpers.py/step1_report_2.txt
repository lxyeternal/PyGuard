{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous connection functions that optionally route through SOCKS proxy servers, parsing proxy URLs and creating socket wrappers accordingly.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url function reads proxy URL data; open_connection and create_connection functions read input parameters such as host, port, and optional socks_url; socket creation and connection methods read network parameters and proxy credentials.",
  "sinks": "socket.connect method initiates network connections; asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection send socket data over the network; unquote unescapes URL components, possibly containing user credentials.",
  "flows": "parse_proxy_url extracts proxy details from URL → create_socket_wrapper creates proxy socket → connect method establishes proxy connection → open_connection/create_connection proceed to establish final network connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of unquote on URL user info is standard but could mask maliciously crafted input. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution present. The code appears straightforward for establishing proxy connections.",
  "analysis": "The code handles proxy URL parsing, socket creation, and connection establishment using standard libraries and patterns. It includes error handling for invalid input and ensures only SOCKS proxies are used with proper validation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of asyncio and socket wrappers is consistent with legitimate proxy connection management. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are detected. All functions are designed to perform network connections securely, assuming the inputs are legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages proxy details, socket creation, and network connections without hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
