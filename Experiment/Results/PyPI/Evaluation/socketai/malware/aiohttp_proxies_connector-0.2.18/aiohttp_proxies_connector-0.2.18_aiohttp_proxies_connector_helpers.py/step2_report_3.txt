  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code handles SOCKS proxy connection setup, parsing proxy URLs, and establishing network connections via asyncio.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is claimed or evident.\n- The code appears well-structured, with proper validation and error handling.\n- The main concern might be the potential misuse of untrusted input, but that is typical for such utility code and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code functions as intended for proxy connection management.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risks:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2). These seem reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n- The code validates host and port, handles URL parsing, and restricts proxy types to SOCKS4/5.\n- Error handling is appropriate.\n\n### Scores:\n- The reports assign **malware=0** consistently, which is justified.\n- The **securityRisk** scores (~0.2) are low but reasonable, considering the code's utility nature.\n- The **obfuscated=0** aligns with the straightforward code.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The only minor concern could be the use of unquote on URL user info, which could be exploited if maliciously crafted, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **0** — No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **0.2** — Low, as the code facilitates proxy connections but could be misused if user inputs are malicious, which is typical for such utilities.\n\n**Additional justification:**  \n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- It handles user input securely with validation.\n- No signs of covert channels or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate | Justification                                                                                 |\n|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                | No malicious behavior or payloads detected.                                                 |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.                                          |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2              | Typical for network utility code; potential misuse depends on user inputs but no inherent risk.|\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connection handling. It is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a summarized report or any further analysis?**",
