{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxy servers, supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url() reads and parses proxy URLs; open_connection() and create_connection() read parameters such as host, port, socks_url, and optional credentials; create_socket_wrapper() reads proxy type, host, port, username, and password.",
  "sinks": "connect() methods on socket wrappers establish connections potentially using untrusted parameters; asyncio.open_connection() and loop.create_connection() create network connections using possibly untrusted socket objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like socks_url, host, port flow into parse_proxy_url() and create_socket_wrapper(); the parsed data then flow into connect() methods, leading to network connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily handles network connection setup with support for proxy URLs and credentials. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully handles parsing of proxy URLs, including unquoting credentials, and creates socket wrappers based on proxy type. It validates essential parameters and raises appropriate exceptions if inputs are invalid. It uses standard asyncio functions to establish network connections, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Usage of untrusted input is limited to network connection setup, which is expected for such utility functions, and there is no evidence of malicious data handling or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for establishing proxy-based network connections. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appropriately manages input validation and uses standard libraries. Overall, it is a benign and typical implementation for SOCKS proxy handling.",
