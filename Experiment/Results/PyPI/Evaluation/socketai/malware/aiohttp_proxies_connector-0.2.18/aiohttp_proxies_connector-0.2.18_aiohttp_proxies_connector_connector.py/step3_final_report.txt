{
  "purpose": "Implements a configurable proxy connector for aiohttp, supporting HTTP and non-HTTP proxies with optional DNS resolution bypass.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as host, port, username, password, proxy type, and proxy URL parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "URL construction for proxy, socket connection via create_socket_wrapper, and network connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Parameters are used to generate proxy URL and socket options, which then flow into socket creation and connection methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NoResolver to bypass DNS resolution could be exploited; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured proxy connector with support for custom DNS resolution and socket wrapping. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External helper functions are assumed safe. The use of NoResolver may be exploited in targeted scenarios but is a known technique. The code handles proxy URL formation and connection logic appropriately, with no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a proxy connector with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified given the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
