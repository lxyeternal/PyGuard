  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any potential issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module initialization (__init__.py style), importing classes, error types, functions, and defining `__all__` and `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code is typical for a Python package setup, primarily serving as an interface aggregator.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as defining and exporting classes, errors, helpers, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows; purely imports/exports.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `confidence=1`. These are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- Correctly notes no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious code.\n- Correctly concludes safety.\n\n**Scores:** Also appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- Recognizes the code as a standard module setup.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:** Correctly assigned.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar analysis.\n- No runtime or network activity, no suspicious patterns.\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Scores:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Same conclusion: standard module setup, no malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero.\n- **Security risk:** Zero.\n- **Confidence in assessments:** 1 for all, justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a typical, benign module setup with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard package interface file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**",
