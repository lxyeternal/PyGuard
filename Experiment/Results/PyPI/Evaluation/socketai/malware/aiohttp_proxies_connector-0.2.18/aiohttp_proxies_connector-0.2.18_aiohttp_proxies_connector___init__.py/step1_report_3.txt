{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports and imports for a SOCKS proxy library, providing error handling, connection management, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or functions that process untrusted data, no data transmission or network connections shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and module metadata (__version__, __all__). It organizes and exposes classes, error types, and functions related to SOCKS proxy handling. There are no inputs, network operations, or data processing in this snippet. It appears to be a standard module setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a straightforward module setup for a SOCKS proxy library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process or transmit sensitive data and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
