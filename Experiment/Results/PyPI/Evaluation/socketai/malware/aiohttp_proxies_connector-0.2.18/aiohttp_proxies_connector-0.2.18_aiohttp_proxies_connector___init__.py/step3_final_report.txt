  "purpose": "Module setup and export of classes, error types, and functions for a SOCKS proxy library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only imports and defines __all__ and __version__.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static import/export structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization file, importing classes, errors, helpers, and constants, then defining __all__ and __version__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or external inputs. All reports agree on its benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as an interface aggregator for the library. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code is standard for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. The supply chain risk is negligible.",
