{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and export classes, error types, and helper functions related to a proxy connector implementation, likely for network communication through a SOCKS proxy.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), including class definitions, error types, and functions, which are used internally or exposed externally.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution points; the code mainly imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow or source-to-sink pathways; the code only defines module structure and interface.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements; the code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module initialization file that imports specific components from sibling modules and exposes them via __all__. It sets a version string and organizes exports. There are no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external input handling. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign, typical package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It functions solely as an interface aggregator for related classes and functions.",
