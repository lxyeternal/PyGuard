  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify that the code is primarily import/export setup, typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or module initialization.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity is present in the snippets.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and the confidence levels are 1, indicating strong agreement on benignity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward, importing classes, functions, and error types from local modules and defining `__all__` and a version string.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data sources are evident.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: module setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware scores: All zero, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores: Zero, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- Security risk scores: Zero, consistent with the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a benign, standard module initialization file.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Final note:**\nGiven the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malicious or security-compromising behavior. The supply chain risk appears negligible.",
