  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward Python module (likely an `__init__.py`) that imports classes, error types, functions, and constants from sibling modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). It then defines `__version__` and `__all__` to specify the public API. There are no dynamic operations, data processing, or external inputs. The code is clean, simple, and typical for a package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities:** None. The code is purely structural, serving as an interface aggregator.\n- **Code anomalies or suspicious patterns:** None. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.\n- **Malicious behavior or backdoors:** Not evident. No network activity, data handling, or code execution points.\n- **Data flow or untrusted data sinks:** Absent. The code only imports and exposes symbols.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n- The code appears correctly structured for its purpose.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the code is standard and safe.\n- No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and the code is simple module setup, there is no reason to adjust scores.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**This code is safe, benign, and poses no security threat.** It functions solely as a module interface setup for a SOCKS proxy library.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, straightforward package initialization file with no malicious or risky elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
