{
  "purpose": "This source code defines module exports and imports related components, likely for a proxy or network connection handling library.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data fetching are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, perform output, or influence system state are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this code snippet, as it primarily involves imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward module setup with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions related to SOCKS proxy handling and network connection management, and then defines the module's public API via __all__ and a version string. It does not perform any dynamic operations, data processing, or system interactions that could be malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within this snippet. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script, exporting specific components for use elsewhere. It does not contain malicious behavior, sensitive data, or suspicious logic. Overall, it appears safe.",
