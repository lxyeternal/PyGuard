{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python module for handling SOCKS proxy connections, providing classes and functions related to proxy connection management and error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto) and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in the provided code; the functions and classes imported may be used elsewhere to perform network connections or handle data, but within this snippet, no direct sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and defines exports; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py style module setup, defining the public API via __all__ and importing necessary components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual logic. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or input handling by itself. All imports are from local modules, indicating modular design, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization file setting up imports and public API. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
