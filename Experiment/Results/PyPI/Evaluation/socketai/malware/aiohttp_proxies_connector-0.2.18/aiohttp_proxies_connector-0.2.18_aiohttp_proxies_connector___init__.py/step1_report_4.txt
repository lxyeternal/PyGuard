{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy client library, providing classes and functions related to proxy connections and errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sink points such as network transmission, file writing, or execution of untrusted data are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks within this code segment; it only imports components and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior, are evident in this snippet. The version string is a normal project identifier.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions related to proxy connections and error handling from local modules. It defines a version string and exports these components. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module file, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The absence of runtime behavior or network activity indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard component of a proxy-related Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily organizes and exposes functionality for use elsewhere.",
