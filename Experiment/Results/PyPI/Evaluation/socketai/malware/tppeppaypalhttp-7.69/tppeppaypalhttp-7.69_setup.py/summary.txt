  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The use of silent execution, obfuscation, and a suspicious URL strongly suggest this is malicious or backdoored code. The package should be treated as potentially malicious until further decoding and analysis confirm its behavior."
