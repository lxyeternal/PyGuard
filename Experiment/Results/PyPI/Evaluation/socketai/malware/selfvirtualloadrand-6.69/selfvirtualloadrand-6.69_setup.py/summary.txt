  "conclusion": "The code contains clear indicators of malicious activity, including obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup, stealthy behavior, and error suppression. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: ~0.9, obfuscation: ~0.9, security risk: ~0.9) are justified. The overall threat level is high, and the package should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms the payload's nature."
