  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, network requests, file reads, dynamic code execution functions (eval(), exec()), untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted inputs or environment variables flow into functions like eval(), exec(), or network requests, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscation techniques, hardcoded credentials, suspicious external references, incomplete or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code shows typical benign patterns in most reports, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation detected in reports 1-3 and 5. Report 4 indicates potential malicious behavior through dynamic code execution, untrusted data handling, and obfuscation, leading to higher malware and security risk scores. Confidence levels reflect the certainty based on available information, with higher confidence in benign assessments and justified suspicion in report 4.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risk; report 4 exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious intent, justified by higher malware and risk scores. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with minimal malware concern, but vigilance is warranted for code with suspicious patterns.",
