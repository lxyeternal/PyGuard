{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with custom install and develop commands that send environment variables to an external URL after installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to external URL with URL-encoded environment data",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables -> URL encoding -> Sending HTTP request to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending all environment variables to an external server during install/develop phases, which is not typical for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools modules, defines functions and custom classes to extend install/develop commands, and in those commands, it gathers all environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via HTTP POST request to an external URL. The function 'notmalfunc' is invoked after install or develop, leading to data exfiltration of environment variables to an external server controlled by an attacker. The URL uses ngrok, indicating a likely malicious or testing setup. There are no other suspicious behaviors like code injection, data leakage beyond environment variables, or obfuscated code. The core concern is the exfiltration of environment data during package installation or development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is performing unauthorized data exfiltration of environment variables by sending them to an external URL during package installation or development. This behavior suggests malicious intent or privacy violation, as it can leak sensitive information. The package itself appears legitimate in structure but contains malicious side effects.",
