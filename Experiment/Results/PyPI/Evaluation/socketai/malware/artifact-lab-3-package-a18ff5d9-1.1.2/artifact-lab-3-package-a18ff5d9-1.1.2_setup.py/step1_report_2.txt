{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script that installs dependencies and custom behaviors during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via os.environ, and makes an HTTP request with urllib.request.Request, passing encoded environment data.",
  "sinks": "The request sends data to an external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app), which could lead to data exfiltration of environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external server (sink) during install or develop commands.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends environment data to an external URL without user consent, and uses a hardcoded external URL with ngrok, indicating potentially malicious or unauthorized data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with custom install and develop commands. These commands invoke a function 'notmalfunc' that collects all environment variables and sends them encoded in a POST request to a specified external URL. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation or development setup. The use of ngrok URL suggests this may be used for malicious data exfiltration, tracking, or backdoor access. The code does not perform any apparent security checks, validation, or obfuscation. The behavior indicates an intent to secretly transmit environment data, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious data exfiltration mechanism that sends environment variables to an external server during package installation or development. This behavior indicates malicious intent related to unauthorized data collection or backdoor activities.",
