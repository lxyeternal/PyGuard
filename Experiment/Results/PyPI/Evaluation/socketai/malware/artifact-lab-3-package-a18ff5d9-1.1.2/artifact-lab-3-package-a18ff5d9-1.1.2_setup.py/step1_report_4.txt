  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with custom install and develop commands that send environment variables to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to a remote URL with environment data encoded in the request body",
  "flows": "os.environ -> notmalfunc() -> urllib.request.Request -> remote server (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app)",
  "anomalies": "Code sends all environment variables unencrypted to an external server upon installation or development setup, which is suspicious. The URL is an ngrok address, often used for temporary or suspicious hosting. The function name 'notmalfunc' appears misspelled and may be obfuscated or malicious. No input validation or safeguards are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to install and develop a package using setuptools. During these processes, it collects all environment variables and encodes them into a URL-encoded form. The notmalfunc() function then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation or development setup. The use of an ngrok URL indicates potential for remote data exfiltration or malicious command-and-control communications. There are no apparent checks, user prompts, or safeguards. The code does not perform any other malicious actions but leaks sensitive environment data to an external entity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables during package installation or development. It uses a suspicious remote URL and automatically sends potentially sensitive data without user consent. This constitutes a security risk and is highly suspicious for supply chain attacks or malicious data theft.",
