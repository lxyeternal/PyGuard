{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'Hello, World!' with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from any source.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function only executes a print statement with a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic function with no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no suspicious features, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or malicious intent are present, and the code poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
