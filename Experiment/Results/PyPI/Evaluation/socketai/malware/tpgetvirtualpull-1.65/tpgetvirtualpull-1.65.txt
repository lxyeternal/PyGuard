      "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell code executed conditionally, with suspicious URL references and silent error handling, strongly indicating malicious activity. The setup code appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious indicators. The high obfuscation and stealth tactics suggest the code is designed for malicious payload delivery or backdoor access."
