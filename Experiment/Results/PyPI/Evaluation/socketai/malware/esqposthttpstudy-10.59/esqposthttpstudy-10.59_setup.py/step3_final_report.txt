  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate malicious behavior in the setup script, focusing on hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution during package installation.",
  "sources": "The conditional check for 'tahg' directory; the subprocess call executing a base64-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess executing the encoded command; potential for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor setup.",
  "flows": "Check for 'tahg' directory existence -> execute hidden PowerShell command via subprocess -> potentially malicious payload runs silently during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command with hidden window flags; suppression of errors; execution during package setup; suspicious URL embedded in the payload.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a conditional execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command when 'tahg' does not exist. The command is encoded in base64, run with hidden window flags, and errors are suppressed, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The URL in the comment suggests command-and-control or malicious hosting. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are consistent with this behavior. The high likelihood of malicious intent justifies these scores, given the stealth, obfuscation, and potential for remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently, indicating malicious intent. The package should be considered malicious, and the high scores reflect significant security risks. It is strongly advised to avoid using or deploying this package until further analysis confirms benign behavior.",
