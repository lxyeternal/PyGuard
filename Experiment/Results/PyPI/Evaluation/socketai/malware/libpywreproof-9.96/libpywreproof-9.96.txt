      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, silent PowerShell execution triggered during setup. While the setup code itself is benign, the obfuscated payload execution poses a significant security risk. Decoding the payload would clarify intent; until then, treat as high risk."
