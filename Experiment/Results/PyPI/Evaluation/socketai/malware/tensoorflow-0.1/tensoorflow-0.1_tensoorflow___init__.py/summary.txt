  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign, with no confirmed malicious activity. Suspicious features such as eval/exec and obfuscation are present but not definitive. The malware and risk scores are appropriately conservative, with a slight increase for Report 4. Overall, the supply chain security risk is low, but continued monitoring of dynamic behaviors is recommended."
