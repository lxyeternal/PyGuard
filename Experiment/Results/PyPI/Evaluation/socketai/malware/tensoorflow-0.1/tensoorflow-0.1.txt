      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly obfuscated with complex, meaningless calculations and dynamic string assembly designed to hide malicious behavior. It conditionally performs system and file operations, potentially installing backdoors or executing malicious payloads. The use of system manipulation functions and environment variables indicates a high probability of malicious intent, representing a severe security risk."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign, with no confirmed malicious activity. Suspicious features such as eval/exec and obfuscation are present but not definitive. The malware and risk scores are appropriately conservative, with a slight increase for Report 4. Overall, the supply chain security risk is low, but continued monitoring of dynamic behaviors is recommended."
