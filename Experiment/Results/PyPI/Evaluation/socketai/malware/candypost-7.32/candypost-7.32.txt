      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during setup, indicative of malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and silent error suppression warrant caution. Further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command are recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
