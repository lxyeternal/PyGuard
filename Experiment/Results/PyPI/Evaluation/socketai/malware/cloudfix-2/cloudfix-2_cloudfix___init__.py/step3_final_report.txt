{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a benign, minimal Python script that reads environment variables and performs no suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ or similar methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables) are read but not propagated to any sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It reads environment variables but does not perform any harmful actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution. The absence of code or malicious indicators justifies a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The low security risk score of 0.1 reflects minimal inherent risk due to external interactions, but given the benign nature, it could be lowered further. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), as the code is simple and clearly benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the scores are consistent with the analysis. The overall assessment indicates a safe dependency with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
