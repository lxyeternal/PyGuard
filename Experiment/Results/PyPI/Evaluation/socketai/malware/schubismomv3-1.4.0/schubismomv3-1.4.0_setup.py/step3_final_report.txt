{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious activity involving decrypting and executing embedded code during Windows package installation, indicating a supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'APPDATA', decrypts hardcoded encrypted payload, writes 'gruppe.py' to disk, and executes it via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec' and subprocess, writing to user directories, and stealthy process creation, potentially leading to system compromise.",
  "flows": "Decrypts payload from hardcoded string -> writes 'gruppe.py' in APPDATA -> executes payload with subprocess -> payload runs malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of long encrypted string, use of 'exec' on decrypted content, writing files in user directories, and launching hidden subprocesses, all indicative of obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code decrypts a hardcoded payload using Fernet, writes it to a file in the APPDATA directory, and executes it stealthily via subprocess with no window flags. The use of 'exec' on decrypted code, encrypted payloads, and environment variable manipulation are classic indicators of malicious activity. The pattern is consistent across multiple reports, with high confidence in malicious intent. The encrypted payload and dynamic execution suggest obfuscation, and the activity poses a severe security risk, including potential remote code execution or data theft. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated~0.8) are justified and aligned with observed behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high-confidence malicious behavior, decrypting and executing payloads stealthily during installation on Windows. The activity is consistent with supply chain malware, warranting immediate security action. The scores are appropriate, reflecting the severity and obfuscation level.",
