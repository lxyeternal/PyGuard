  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered during package installation, indicating malicious intent. The external URL, encoded command, and silent execution strongly suggest remote code execution or data exfiltration. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate, and the package should be scrutinized or removed to prevent security breaches."
