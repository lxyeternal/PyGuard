      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, system-level manipulations, privilege checks, and indirect execution paths, all pointing toward malicious intent. It is likely designed to conceal payloads such as backdoors, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and justified. The package should be considered malicious and avoided; further analysis is recommended before any deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears mostly benign with no evidence of malicious activity. Minor concerns about potential obfuscation and input handling are acknowledged but do not warrant high risk scores. The overall security posture is low risk, and the existing report scores are justified."
