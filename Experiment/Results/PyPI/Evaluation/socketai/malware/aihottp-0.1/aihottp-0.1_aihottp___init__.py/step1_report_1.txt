{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard libraries and performs basic operations, likely for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; no user input or data reading functions are present in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network calls, file writes, or database interactions are present that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; the code performs isolated operations without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated elements, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard imports and performs routine operations without evident malicious intent. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The absence of network activity, sensitive data handling, or obfuscated code suggests a benign purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates in a straightforward manner without any suspicious elements.",
