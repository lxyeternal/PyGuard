  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, system-level manipulations, privilege checks, and indirect execution paths, all pointing toward malicious intent. It is likely designed to conceal payloads such as backdoors, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and justified. The package should be considered malicious and avoided; further analysis is recommended before any deployment."
