  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only anomaly is the URL pointing to a Rickroll video, which is a prank and does not pose a security threat. The malware score is 0, and the low risk score reflects the minor distraction factor. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use, with the URL being the only unprofessional element."
