  "purpose": "Standard setuptools setup configuration for packaging a Python project with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings in setup() parameters: name, version, author, email, description, URLs, classifiers, dependencies, package_dir, packages, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The project URL and bug tracker URL point to a Rick Astley YouTube video ('Never Gonna Give You Up'), which is a well-known prank (rickroll).",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only unusual aspect is the URL pointing to a Rickroll video, which is a prank but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) due to the URL anomaly. No data flows or suspicious code patterns are present. The code's structure and content are clear and standard, with no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only anomaly is the URL pointing to a Rickroll video, which is a prank and does not pose a security threat. The malware score is 0, and the low risk score reflects the minor distraction factor. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use, with the URL being the only unprofessional element.",
