  "malware_score": 0.8,
  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior, involving obfuscated payload execution during package installation, with indicators such as suspicious URL, obfuscation, and silent execution. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these findings."
