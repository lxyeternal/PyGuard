The scores are consistent with the observations, with a slight note that if obfuscation in Report 3 is confirmed, increasing the malware score slightly (e.g., to 0.3) could be justified. Otherwise, the current scores are appropriate and conservative."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors including payload encryption, remote code download and execution, persistence mechanisms, and obfuscation. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.85-0.9, obfuscated: 0.75-0.8, risk: 0.9) are justified and consistent with its capabilities. It should be treated as high-severity malware with remote control features."
