{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a straightforward Python script that imports modules, defines functions, and executes main logic. It does not exhibit obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and possibly external modules (though their specific use isn't detailed).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections or file operations if present, but none are explicitly evident in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables into variables or functions, but no clear malicious flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code structure is typical, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines functions in a conventional manner. No suspicious or malicious patterns like dynamic code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. There are no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated sections. The code appears to perform expected operations without unusual data flows or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is typical in structure and content, with no suspicious signals detected.",
