  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or functionality that involves external modules.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'input' function, environment variables, and potentially from imported modules or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output via print statements, writes data to files, or network operations if present in the imported modules.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources and environment variables through processing functions, possibly to output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network calls. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, processes inputs, and may perform file or network operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining, is detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns observed. The structure is typical, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate, with standard data handling routines. However, since no specific code content was provided, this analysis assumes typical usage. Confidence is moderate due to lack of detailed code.",
