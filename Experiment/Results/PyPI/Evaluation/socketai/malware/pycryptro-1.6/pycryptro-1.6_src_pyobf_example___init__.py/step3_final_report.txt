  "sources": "Code input, module imports, function definitions, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, environment variable usage, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to outputs or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious API calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with standard modules and no malicious patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious data flows are present. The confidence is high due to the detailed review and lack of suspicious indicators. The risk score is minimal, reflecting the low likelihood of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is considered safe with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The supply chain security risk is very low, and scores are justified based on the provided information.",
