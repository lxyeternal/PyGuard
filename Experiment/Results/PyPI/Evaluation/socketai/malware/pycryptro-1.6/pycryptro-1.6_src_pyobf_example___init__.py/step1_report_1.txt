  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or configuration tasks, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs could come from environment variables, user inputs, or imported modules; no explicit source code provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths cannot be determined without concrete code, but typically would be from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system effects).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code details provided; unable to identify specific sources, sinks, or malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The code appears benign based on the fragment available.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code seems standard, but a full review would require more context or the complete code.",
