{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'pycryptro' with specified metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata, such as name, version, author, email, URL, keywords, and a list of dependencies ('requests').",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior, file operations, network calls, or code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs is present; the setup process uses static configuration data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code follows standard setup conventions with no hidden or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package, importing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and directory structure. The author email and URL appear generic and do not indicate malicious intent. No input parsing, dynamic code execution, or external data handling occurs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
