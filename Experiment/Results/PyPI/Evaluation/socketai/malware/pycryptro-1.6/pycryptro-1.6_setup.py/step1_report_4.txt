  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'pycryptro' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read from the 'setuptools' module and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; setup configuration does not involve data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Author email appears generic; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package location. The only dependency is 'requests', which is common and benign. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident. The author email is generic and does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be straightforward and typical for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
