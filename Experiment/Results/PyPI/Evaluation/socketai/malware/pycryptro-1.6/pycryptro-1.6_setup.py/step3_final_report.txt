  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package info, author, email, URL, dependencies, and package directory.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static configuration data only.",
  "anomalies": "Author email and name are generic; no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with static configuration data. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The author info is non-specific but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The minor security concern about author info does not translate into actual risk. The dependency on 'requests' is common and harmless. No data flows or external code execution are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
