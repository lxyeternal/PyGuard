  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'pycryptro' Python package",
  "sources": "The entire script, primarily the setup() function call with its parameters",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no code execution or data handling beyond package configuration",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or data leaks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, hidden backdoors, or malicious code. The email address is generic; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and calls setup() to configure package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package location, author info, URL, and dependencies, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. The only dependency is 'requests', which is common for network operations but does not imply malicious intent. The author email appears generic and does not raise suspicion. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions solely as a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
