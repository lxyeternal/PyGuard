  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points such as eval, exec, network calls, input reading, environment variable access, file operations, and data handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system, system commands) via code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, hardcoded IPs or credentials, suspicious network calls, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are primarily benign, with straightforward logic and no evidence of malicious payloads. Report 3 mentions obfuscation but does not confirm malicious intent; the obfuscation score of 0.2 is cautious but acceptable. All other reports are consistent with their low malware and risk scores. The confidence levels are appropriate, reflecting the certainty of the assessments. No suspicious behaviors or security flaws are identified that warrant higher scores.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates minimal security risk and no confirmed malicious activity across the analyzed code snippets. The scores are consistent with the observations, with a slight note that if obfuscation in Report 3 is confirmed, increasing the malware score slightly (e.g., to 0.3) could be justified. Otherwise, the current scores are appropriate and conservative.",
