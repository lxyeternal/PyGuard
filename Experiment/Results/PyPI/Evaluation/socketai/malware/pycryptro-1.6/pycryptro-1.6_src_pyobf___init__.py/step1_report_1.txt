{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a basic web server that handles incoming HTTP requests and responds with a simple message.",
  "sources": "HTTP request handling functions, possibly reading request data",
  "sinks": "Response functions that send data back to the client, potentially logging or processing request data",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP requests flows into the request handlers and then into response functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network connections, and no obfuscated code detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries to create a web server, defining request handlers for specific routes. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data flows are evident. The code's logic is simple, handling incoming requests and sending responses without any hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a basic web server purpose. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
