  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates minimal security risk and no confirmed malicious activity across the analyzed code snippets. The scores are consistent with the observations, with a slight note that if obfuscation in Report 3 is confirmed, increasing the malware score slightly (e.g., to 0.3) could be justified. Otherwise, the current scores are appropriate and conservative."
