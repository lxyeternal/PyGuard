  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the obfuscated, stealthy execution of a PowerShell command conditioned on filesystem state. While the exact payload is unknown, the behavior pattern indicates potential malicious activity. The high scores assigned by the reports are justified; further decoding of the command is recommended for definitive assessment."
