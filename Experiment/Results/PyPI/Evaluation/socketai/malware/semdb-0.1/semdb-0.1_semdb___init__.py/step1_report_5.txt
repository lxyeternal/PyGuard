{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and utility functions, with no obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading input from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules; no hardcoded user input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to logs, files, or network connections; no suspicious or unexpected data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; no untrusted data flow paths that lead to security-critical operations are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; code structure is straightforward. No unusual language features or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of typical utility functions and standard processing routines. There are no signs of obfuscated code or hidden behavior. External libraries are used normally without suspicious patterns. No code segments perform network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The overall structure and content do not suggest malicious intent or malware. Security risk appears minimal, and no malicious signals are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard coding practices without suspicious patterns.",
