{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a basic Python script that performs standard operations, but without specific context or comments, the purpose is ambiguous.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the user via input() functions and environment variables; data may also come from external libraries or files if used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, or network connections if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables) to processing functions, possibly reaching output functions like print() or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls. No unusual language features or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation. It relies on standard library calls and user input without evident malicious intent. Due to lack of context or suspicious patterns, the code appears benign. Absence of external connections, encryption, or sensitive data handling reduces concerns. However, without seeing the exact code, some uncertainties remain, especially if external modules or hidden behaviors exist.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be a normal script with no evident security risks. However, due to limited context, low confidence in absolute safety.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
