  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during setup, embedded malicious URL, and error suppression. The scores reflect a high likelihood of malware presence and significant security risk. It should be considered malicious or compromised until further payload analysis confirms safety."
