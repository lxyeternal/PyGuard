      "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent due to silent, obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered during setup. The embedded URL and obfuscation reinforce suspicion. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend a malware score of 0.8, obfuscation 0.8, and security risk 0.8. Further decoding of the payload is advised to confirm malicious actions. All reports are consistent and justified in their assessments."
