      "conclusion": "The code contains high-risk malicious behavior characterized by obfuscated PowerShell execution, external URL contact, and stealthy operation. The setup script itself appears benign but is exploited as a vector for malicious payload delivery. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and should be treated as a serious security concern."
