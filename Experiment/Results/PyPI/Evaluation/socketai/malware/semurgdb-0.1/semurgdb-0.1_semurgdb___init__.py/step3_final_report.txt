  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network calls, dynamic execution points (eval/exec), hardcoded credentials.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or file writes, possibly via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation, use of eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, complex or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with straightforward utility functions, minimal or no suspicious patterns, and no evidence of malicious intent. The reports consistently show low malware and obfuscation scores, with high confidence in benign assessments. Report 5 indicates potential suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features but lacks confirmed malicious activity. Scores reflect this suspicion without asserting definitive malicious behavior. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the described code snippets, and scores are appropriate given the evidence. Further dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious patterns in report 5.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign with low security risks. Report 5 shows potential obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting cautious scoring but no definitive malicious activity. The overall security posture is low risk, with minor suspicion in specific areas. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no significant revisions are necessary unless further code details reveal more malicious patterns.",
