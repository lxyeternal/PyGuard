{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and perform an installation process that includes executing a potentially malicious payload.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and URL requests to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') via os.system('start '+filename).",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via a GET request to a remote server, and if on Windows, a file is downloaded and executed, creating a flow from environment data to remote server communication and local execution of remote content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a generic try-except block hiding errors, execution of a downloaded executable without verification, and retrieval of environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' for sending to an external server.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, along with os, requests, and platform modules. It defines a 'send' function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it via a GET request to a suspicious URL, and if on Windows, downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable. The 'PostInstallCommand' class extends the install command to run 'send' after installation. The setup configuration registers this custom command for the install process. The behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system information and run a remote payload silently during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment data and downloading/executing a remote payload without user consent, representing a high security risk. It appears to be intentionally malicious, hidden within a standard setup script.",
