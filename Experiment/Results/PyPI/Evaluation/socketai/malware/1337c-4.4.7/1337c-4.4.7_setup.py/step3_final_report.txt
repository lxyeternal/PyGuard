{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system environment data, download a remote executable, and execute it during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; reads URLs for downloading executable; reads system environment and platform info.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs; writing and executing downloaded executable via os.system; sending data over network.",
  "flows": "Source (environment variable and URL request) → data sent to external server; download executable from URL → execute via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling with 'except: pass'; downloading and executing an executable during package install; use of suspicious URLs; no validation of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves environment info, exfiltrates it via HTTP GET, downloads a suspicious executable from a non-legitimate URL, and executes it silently during installation. The broad exception handling conceals errors, and the URLs are suspicious. The behavior aligns with typical supply chain malware tactics, including remote code execution and data theft. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but performs malicious activities, justifying high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, performing data exfiltration and executing remote payloads during package installation. The scores in the reports are justified; however, the malware score should be set to 1.0, and the overall security risk should also be maximum, reflecting the severe threat.",
