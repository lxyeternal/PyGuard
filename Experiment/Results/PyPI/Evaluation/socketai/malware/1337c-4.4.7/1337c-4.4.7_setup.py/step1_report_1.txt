{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and includes a custom post-installation step that downloads and executes an external executable, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URL in requests.get, and the os.system call executing a downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the downloaded executable 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe'.",
  "flows": "Retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends data via HTTP GET request -> Downloads an executable file -> Executes the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes fetching and executing an external executable during package installation, which is suspicious. The URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' and the filename 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe' are indicative of potentially malicious activity. The use of broad exception handling ('except: pass') hides errors that could signal malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a remote server. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and runs it. This behavior occurs during the package installation via a custom 'PostInstallCommand'. The download and execution of external code pose significant security risks, as this could allow remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation. The URL and filename are indicative of malicious intent. The broad exception handling conceals potential errors, making detection more difficult.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, likely aiming to compromise the host system. The suspicious URL, execution of downloaded files, and environment data collection support this conclusion.",
