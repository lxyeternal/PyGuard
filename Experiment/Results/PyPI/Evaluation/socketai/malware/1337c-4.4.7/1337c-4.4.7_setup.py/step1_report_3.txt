{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and perform additional actions during installation, including sending data and downloading/executing a file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Requests data from external URLs and executes downloaded files using os.system('start '+filename).",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via a GET request, then a file is downloaded from a suspicious URL and executed on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it to an external server, downloads an executable file from an untrusted URL, and executes it automatically during package installation. The URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php' and 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' are suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of os.system to run downloaded executable without user consent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that attempts to retrieve the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this data to an external URL. If the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable from an untrusted source and executes it immediately, which could be malicious. The function is invoked during the custom installation process via the PostInstallCommand class, which extends setuptools' install command. The overall setup configuration is standard but includes malicious behaviors embedded in the post-install steps, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing an external payload during package installation. The external URLs and execution of downloaded files are highly suspicious and indicate likely malware intent.",
