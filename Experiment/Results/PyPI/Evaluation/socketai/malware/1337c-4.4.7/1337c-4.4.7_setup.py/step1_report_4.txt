{
  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process for a Python package, including sending environment data to a remote server and downloading and executing a potentially malicious file during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; making HTTP GET requests to external URLs; executing downloaded files with os.system.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded file 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe' with os.system, which could run arbitrary malicious code.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent via a GET request; then a remote script is downloaded and executed on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function transmits system environment info to an external domain; downloads and automatically runs an executable file during package installation without user consent; lack of error handling or validation of the downloaded content; the domain names used are suspicious and do not relate to legitimate Python package hosting or distribution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities and requests, then defines a send() function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It sends this info to a suspicious URL and, if on Windows, downloads an executable from a questionable domain and executes it automatically. The custom PostInstallCommand class ensures this behavior runs during package installation. The setup configuration specifies package details but includes a command that triggers the malicious activity. The code’s flow indicates an attempt to exfiltrate environment data and execute malicious payloads silently during installation, with no user warning or validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by transmitting system info and executing an external executable during installation without user consent, indicative of supply chain sabotage or malware. It is highly suspicious and should not be used.",
