{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom post-installation step which attempts to send environment information and download and execute a file.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; requests to external URLs; potentially executes downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs; execution of downloaded file via os.system.",
  "flows": "send() retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME' -> sends data via GET request -> downloads executable -> runs executable.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional try-except block suppresses errors, potentially hides malicious activity; downloads and executes external file without validation; uses 'os.system' for execution which is risky; environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' used to personalize request.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send()' that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately. The execution is initiated via 'os.system' without any validation or user consent. The try-except block suppresses all errors, potentially hiding malicious activity. The setup process includes this 'send()' call in a custom install command, meaning the malicious actions occur during package installation. These behaviors indicate malicious intent, such as system information exfiltration, downloading, and executing arbitrary code. No benign functionality appears evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info, downloading, and executing a remote file during package installation. It poses a significant security risk and should be considered malicious.",
