      "conclusion": "The code contains clear indicators of malicious activity, notably the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during package setup, with high suspicion based on obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. This package should be considered malicious until further payload analysis confirms safety."
