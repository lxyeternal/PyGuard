  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'etherapi' Python module.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'install_requires' list; no suspicious or unusual code or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup configuration defining package metadata. It does not contain any input reading, data processing, or network operations. The 'install_requires' field is empty, indicating no dependencies, and no code execution, credential handling, or external data fetching occurs. The code appears to be standard, minimal setup code without malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
