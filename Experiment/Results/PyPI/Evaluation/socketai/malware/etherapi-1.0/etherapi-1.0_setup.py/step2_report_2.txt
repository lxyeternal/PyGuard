  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a straightforward setup script with no external input, data processing, or network activity.\n- Notes the empty 'install_requires' list, which is benign.\n- Assigns scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature and benign configuration.\n- Highlights the unusual empty string in 'install_requires' but concludes it's not malicious.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the static, benign setup code.\n- Notes the empty 'install_requires' as possibly incomplete but not malicious.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar conclusion: standard setup script, benign, with a minor note on the empty dependencies list.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same pattern: static configuration, no suspicious behavior.\n- Slight concern about the empty 'install_requires' but no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is exactly as the original, with no hidden or malicious elements.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor issue is the empty 'install_requires' list, which might be a misconfiguration or placeholder, but it does not pose a security risk.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0; no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The repeated mention of the empty 'install_requires' list suggests it might be an oversight rather than malicious intent.\n- No evidence of code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n\n**Summary:** The entire set of reports correctly identifies this setup script as benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
