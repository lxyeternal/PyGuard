  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a straightforward setup script with no external input, data processing, or network activity.\n- Correctly notes the 'install_requires' is empty but benign.\n- Assigns malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully accurate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Highlights the empty 'install_requires' as unusual but not malicious.\n- Correctly states the code is standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware and security risk scores are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, emphasizes the static nature and benign metadata.\n- Notes the empty dependencies but no malicious behavior.\n- Malware and security risk scores are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Also recognizes the setup script as benign.\n- Mentions the empty 'install_requires' as potentially incomplete but not malicious.\n- Malware and security risk scores are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Describes the code as a standard configuration, with no external inputs or dynamic code.\n- Notes the empty 'install_requires' as possibly an oversight.\n- Malware and security risk scores are 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, benign setup script.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Security risk:** Also 0 across reports, appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Potential issues:** The only minor concern is the empty 'install_requires' list, which could indicate incomplete configuration but not malicious intent.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at **0**.\n- The risk score should be **below 0.5**, ideally **0**, since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0               |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The only potential improvement is noting that the empty 'install_requires' might be an oversight, but it doesn't elevate any risk level.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
