      "conclusion": "The setup script contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell code executed silently during installation, indicative of malicious activity such as backdoors or payload delivery. The pattern aligns with known supply chain attack techniques. While the actual payload content is unknown, the obfuscation, covert execution, and context warrant a high malware and risk assessment."
