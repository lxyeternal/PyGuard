  "purpose": "A simple calculator class with basic arithmetic functions, including data reporting via network requests.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('USER', 'HOSTNAME'), hostname via socket, and current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request sent to an external URL with system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables, socket hostname, and current working directory flows into the requests.get call, transmitting system info to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unnecessary environment variable reads, and an HTTP request sending system information without clear purpose. The commented code suggests prior testing or potential for further malicious activity. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a calculator class with basic arithmetic methods. The 'add' method collects system info (environment variables, hostname, current directory) and transmits this data via a GET request to an external URL, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. Other methods are straightforward arithmetic operations without side effects. The environment variables 'USER' and 'HOSTNAME' are fetched, and hostname and cwd are obtained, then sent as URL parameters. No malicious payloads like code execution, data theft, or system damage are evident. The commented-out code hints at prior or alternative network reporting mechanisms. The code structure and formatting are standard, with no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign calculations but includes an external network request that transmits system information, which could be used for tracking or privacy violations. No malicious behavior such as data theft, system damage, or backdoors is detected. The activity appears more suspicious than malicious but warrants caution due to data transmission behavior.",
