{
  "purpose": "The code implements basic calculator functions but additionally collects environment and system information during the 'add' operation and transmits it to an external URL, which is suspicious behavior outside typical calculator functionality.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('USER', 'HOSTNAME'), system hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "Requests to 'https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/' with system info as URL parameters",
  "flows": "In 'add()', system info is gathered from sources and sent via HTTP GET request to the external URL; other methods do not perform network activity",
  "anomalies": "Unusual data exfiltration during a simple calculator operation; transmission of system info without user consent or clear purpose",
  "analysis": "The code's 'add' method retrieves environment variables and system info, then sends this data to an external server, which is suspicious for a calculator class. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The network request indicates potential privacy violations or data leakage. The other methods are benign. The scores in the reports reflect concern over this exfiltration. The behavior is consistent across reports, with varying malware and security risk scores based on suspicion level. The activity warrants caution but does not constitute active malware, as no malicious payloads are present. The main risk stems from privacy violation and unsolicited data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by transmitting system info during a calculator operation, which could be used for tracking or data theft. No malicious payloads are present, but the activity is privacy-invasive. The malware score should be moderate (~0.4-0.5), and the security risk score high (~0.7), reflecting the privacy concern. The code should be flagged for review or removal if unintended. Overall, the behavior is suspicious but not outright malicious payloads are detected.",
