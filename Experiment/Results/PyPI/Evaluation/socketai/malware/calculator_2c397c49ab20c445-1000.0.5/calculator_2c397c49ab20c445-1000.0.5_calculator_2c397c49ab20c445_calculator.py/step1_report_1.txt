  "purpose": "A simple calculator class providing basic arithmetic operations with some environment and system info reporting.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables 'USER' and 'HOSTNAME'; obtaining hostname via socket; getting current working directory; reading input from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to a remote URL with system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "When 'add' method is called, it reads environment variables and system info, then sends this data to an external server, potentially exposing system details. Other methods do not perform external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The 'add' method sends system information to an external URL without any apparent purpose, which is unusual for a calculator function. Use of environment variables and system info in a network request suggests potential data leakage or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a calculator class with basic arithmetic methods. The 'add' method notably retrieves environment variables 'USER' and 'HOSTNAME', gets the system hostname and current directory, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a specified external URL. This behavior occurs every time 'add' is called. Other arithmetic methods do not perform any network activity. The inclusion of system info transmission is suspicious as it could be used for tracking or data exfiltration without user consent. The commented-out code indicates prior or alternative implementations involving webhooks, but they are inactive. Overall, the code exhibits behavior that could be used for malicious data collection, although no direct malicious actions like file manipulation or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a calculator but contains suspicious behavior in the 'add' method, which transmits system information to an external server. This behavior suggests potential privacy concerns or malicious data exfiltration. Other parts of the code are benign. Overall, the presence of unsolicited network communication in a simple calculator class raises security concerns.",
