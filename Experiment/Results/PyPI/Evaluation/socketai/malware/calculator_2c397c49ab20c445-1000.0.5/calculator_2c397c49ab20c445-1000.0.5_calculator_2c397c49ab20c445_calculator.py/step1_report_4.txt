  "purpose": "A simple calculator class with basic arithmetic functions that also collects and sends system information over the network.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('USER'), os.getenv('HOSTNAME'), socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "requests.get to an external URL with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, socket info) are used to gather system data, which is then sent via requests.get to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Code in the 'add' method collects environment variables and system info, then sends this data externally without any clear necessity or user consent. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious. No validation or sanitization of data is performed. The purpose of sending system info is unclear and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a calculator class with standard arithmetic methods. The 'add' method, aside from performing addition, collects system information such as 'USER' and 'HOSTNAME' environment variables, the hostname, and current working directory. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, which appears suspicious. The other methods ('subtract', 'multiply', 'divide') perform straightforward calculations with no side effects. The commented-out code and additional functions do not contain any malicious behavior but indicate prior or alternative data collection attempts. The primary concern is the external network request that leaks system information, which could be used for malicious purposes like tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior in the 'add' method, which collects system info and exfiltrates it without a clear legitimate purpose. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent related to data leakage. The rest of the code performs standard calculations with no evident malicious activity.",
