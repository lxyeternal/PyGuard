  "sinks": "requests.get() to an external URL with system information as parameters",
  "flows": "System information is gathered via environment variables and socket calls, then sent to an external server through an HTTP GET request",
  "anomalies": "The add() method collects environment variables and hostname, then sends this data to an external server without any clear purpose related to calculation. The data transmission occurs every time add() is called, which is unusual for a calculator function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a calculator class with basic arithmetic methods. The add() method additionally retrieves environment variables and hostname information, then transmits this data to an external URL via a GET request. This behavior is suspicious as it sends system info to an external domain without user consent or apparent necessity. The other arithmetic methods do not contain any malicious or anomalous behavior. Commented code suggests prior attempts at similar data collection. The code structure and formatting are straightforward and not obfuscated. The external URL is a pipedream.net endpoint, which is commonly used for testing and monitoring, but its use here in conjunction with system info raises privacy concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious behavior where system information is collected and sent to an external server during the execution of the add() method. This indicates an active data exfiltration attempt embedded within a seemingly innocent calculator class. The rest of the code is benign, but the information leakage is concerning.",
