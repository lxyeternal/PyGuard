  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by transmitting system info during a calculator operation, which could be used for tracking or data theft. No malicious payloads are present, but the activity is privacy-invasive. The malware score should be moderate (~0.4-0.5), and the security risk score high (~0.7), reflecting the privacy concern. The code should be flagged for review or removal if unintended. Overall, the behavior is suspicious but not outright malicious payloads are detected."
