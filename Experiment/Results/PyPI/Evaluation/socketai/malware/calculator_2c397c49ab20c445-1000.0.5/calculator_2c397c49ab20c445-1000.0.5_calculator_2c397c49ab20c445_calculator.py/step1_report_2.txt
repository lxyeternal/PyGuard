{
  "purpose": "Provides basic calculator functions including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('USER', 'HOSTNAME'), retrieves system hostname and current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET request to an external URL with system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system info are collected; then, this data is sent via a GET request to an external server within the add() method.",
  "anomalies": "The add() method performs an external network request with system information each time it's called, which is unusual for a calculator function. No input validation or restriction is present for external communication. The environment variables used ('USER', 'HOSTNAME') are standard, but their data is being transmitted externally without any apparent reason.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a calculator class with basic arithmetic functions. The add() function uniquely collects system environment variables, hostname, and current directory, then sends this data to an external URL using requests.get(). This behavior is inconsistent with typical calculator functionality and suggests potential data leakage or tracking behavior. The other functions (subtract, multiply, divide) are straightforward and contain no suspicious activity. The commented-out code indicates some previous intent to include webhook communications but is inactive. Overall, the main concern is the external request transmitting system info, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic calculator operations but includes suspicious behavior by sending system information to an external server during addition. This external communication could be a privacy violation or a malicious attempt to gather system data. The rest of the code appears benign, but the external request in add() raises security concerns.",
