  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the module 'calculator' within the 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this line; potential for imported functions to be used in a malicious way elsewhere, but not evident here.",
  "flows": "None in this snippet; only a module import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly unique or obfuscated package name ('calculator_2c397c49ab20c445'), which could be an attempt to evade detection or hide malicious intent. The import statement itself is simple but the package name may suggest obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a module named 'calculator' within a package that appears to have a randomized or hashed name. The import statement itself is benign, but the unusual package naming raises suspicion of possible obfuscation or attempts to hide malicious code. No malicious behavior is visible in this single line, but without further context, the purpose of the package cannot be verified. The use of wildcard import can sometimes hide malicious functions, but on its own, this line does not execute any harmful code.",
  "conclusion": "This code line performs a standard import from a suspiciously named package, which could indicate obfuscation. No malicious actions are explicitly visible, but the context suggests the package might be intended to conceal malicious functionality or evade detection. Further review of the actual contents of the 'calculator' module is recommended.",
