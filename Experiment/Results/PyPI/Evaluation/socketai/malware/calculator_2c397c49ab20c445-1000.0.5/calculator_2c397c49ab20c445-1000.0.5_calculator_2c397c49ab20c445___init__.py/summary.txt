  "conclusion": "The import statement is not inherently malicious but warrants further inspection of the package contents. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and malware scores are appropriately low. The code's benign appearance suggests that the primary concern is obfuscated naming, which could hide malicious code if present. Further analysis of the 'calculator' module within the package is recommended to confirm safety."
