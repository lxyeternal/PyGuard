  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Import all from `calculator` module within `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445`.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- The package name appears obfuscated or autogenerated.\n- Wildcard import (`*`) can hide which functions are imported, potentially hiding malicious code.\n- The import statement itself is benign but warrants further inspection of the package contents.\n- The malware score is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n**Score Evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (High, package name looks suspicious)\n- **Malware:** 0.2 (Low, no direct evidence of malicious code)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (Low to moderate, depends on package contents)\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The low malware score aligns with the minimal code snippet. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Same as above, emphasizing suspicious package naming.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- The package name is complex and obfuscated.\n- No direct malicious activity can be inferred from the import alone.\n- The suspicion stems from obfuscated naming, not from actual code behavior.\n\n**Score Evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (High, consistent with suspicion)\n- **Malware:** 0 (No evidence)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3 (Moderate, package could hide malicious code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent. The malware score should remain low. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Import all from `calculator` in `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445`.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- Wildcard import is discouraged as it can hide malicious functions.\n- The package name appears obfuscated.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior from the import alone.\n\n**Score Evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3 (Lower than previous, but still notable)\n- **Malware:** 0 (No evidence)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (Low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** Import all from `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator`.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- Similar pattern: obfuscated module name.\n- No malicious activity evident in the import statement.\n- The risk depends on the imported code, which isn't provided.\n\n**Score Evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (High, consistent with suspicion)\n- **Malware:** 0 (No direct evidence)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (Low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** Same as above, emphasizing potential obfuscation.\n\n**Analysis & Findings:**\n- Obfuscated package name.\n- Wildcard import can hide malicious functions.\n- No direct malicious activity from the import line.\n\n**Score Evaluation:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (High, consistent)\n- **Malware:** 0.2 (Low)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 (Moderate, due to obfuscation)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the evidence. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Final Recommendations**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the obfuscated package name as suspicious but lack evidence of malicious code within the import statement itself.\n- The malware scores are appropriately low, given the limited context.\n- The obfuscation scores are high, reflecting suspicion.\n- The security risk scores are moderate, considering the potential for malicious code hiding within the imported modules.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.2 – consistent with the reports; without code analysis of the package, no higher score is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.7 – high, given the obfuscated package names.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 – moderate, due to obfuscation and wildcard import practices.\n\n**Final note:** The import statement alone does not confirm malicious activity. However, the obfuscated naming warrants further inspection of the package contents to ensure security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and cautious.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- Further investigation should focus on the actual contents of `calculator_2c397c49ab20c445` and its `calculator` module to confirm or deny malicious intent.",
