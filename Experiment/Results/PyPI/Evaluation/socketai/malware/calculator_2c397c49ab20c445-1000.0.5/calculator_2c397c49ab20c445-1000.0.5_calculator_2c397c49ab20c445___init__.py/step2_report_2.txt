  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The code snippet is a straightforward import statement:  \n  `from calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator import *`  \n  It is syntactically correct and performs an import. No code execution beyond loading the module occurs here.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws in reasoning?**  \n  The report correctly notes that the package name appears obfuscated and that wildcard import can hide imported functions, which could be suspicious. It appropriately states that the import itself isn't malicious but warrants further inspection.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (high, justified by the suspicious package name)  \n  - **Malware:** 0.2 (low, no evidence of malicious code in the snippet)  \n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, import alone is benign)  \n\n  These seem reasonable. The confidence level (0.4) is also appropriate given the suspicion based solely on naming.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, it describes an import from an obfuscated package with a suspicious name. No malicious code is directly indicated.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly emphasizes the obfuscated name and the potential for concealment but notes no direct malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (consistent with suspicion)  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)  \n  - **Security Risk:** 0.3 (slightly higher, considering the suspicion)  \n\n  These are reasonable. The confidence (0.4) aligns with the cautious stance.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same pattern: import from a package with a hash-like name, wildcard import.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly notes that the wildcard import can hide malicious functions, but no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.3 (lower, as the package name is less suspicious than others)  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)  \n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, given no direct malicious behavior)  \n\n  The scores seem appropriate. The confidence (0.6) is slightly higher, reflecting moderate suspicion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same as previous, import from a hashed module name with no code execution here.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Correctly notes that obfuscated names could hide malicious code but no evidence in this line.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (consistent with suspicion)  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no evidence)  \n  - **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low)  \n\n  The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same pattern: import from a package with an obfuscated name, wildcard import.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The report appropriately emphasizes that the package name could be an attempt at obfuscation but does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (justified)  \n  - **Malware:** 0.2 (low)  \n  - **Security Risk:** 0.4 (moderate, due to suspicion)  \n\n  These are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign low malware scores (0.2 or 0), which aligns with the fact that the code snippet is just an import statement. No evidence of malicious code execution or payload is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High (0.7) in most reports, justified by the package naming pattern. Slight variation in report 3 with 0.3, but overall, suspicion is justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low, reflecting that the code alone isn't malicious but the obfuscated naming warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- The code snippet itself is benign; no malicious activity is confirmed.\n- The high obfuscation scores are justified due to suspicious naming conventions.\n- The malware scores should remain low unless further analysis of the imported modules reveals malicious code.\n- Given the pattern, I would assign **my own estimates** as follows:\n\n  - **Malware:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (due to naming suspicion)\n  - **Risk:** 0.3 (moderate, mainly due to obfuscation, but no direct malicious activity)\n\n**In conclusion**, the reports are consistent and cautious but do not provide evidence of malicious behavior based solely on the import statement. Further analysis of the actual contents of the `calculator` module within the obfuscated package is necessary to confirm or refute potential malicious intent.",
