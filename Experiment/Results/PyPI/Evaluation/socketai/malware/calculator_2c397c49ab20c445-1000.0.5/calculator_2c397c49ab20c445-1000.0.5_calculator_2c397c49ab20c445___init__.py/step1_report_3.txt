  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the calculator module in the calculator_2c397c49ab20c445 package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the calculator module from the calculator_2c397c49ab20c445 package.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks in this code snippet; the imported module may contain sinks, but this code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "The code imports the module, which may then be used elsewhere, but no data flow or untrusted data handling is present here.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard '*', which can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious or unintended code execution if the module is malicious. The module name includes a hash-like string, which could be used to obscure or differentiate malicious packages, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "This is a single import statement importing everything from a module with a hashed name. The use of a hash in the package name might suggest obfuscation or attempt to evade detection. The wildcard import is generally discouraged due to lack of clarity. There is no evident malicious behavior in the import statement itself. Without inspecting the contents of the imported module, no definitive malicious activity can be identified. The code is minimal and does not execute any further operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet performs a standard import operation from a package with an obscure name. The wildcard import could hide malicious code within the imported module, but based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent. The overall security risk appears low at this point, but caution should be exercised if the imported module's content is unknown or untrusted.",
