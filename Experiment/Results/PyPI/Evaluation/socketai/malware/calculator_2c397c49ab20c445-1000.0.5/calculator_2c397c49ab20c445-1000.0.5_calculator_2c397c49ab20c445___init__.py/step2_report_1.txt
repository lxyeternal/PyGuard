  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a simple import statement from a package/module with a complex, hash-like name.\n- The code snippet is minimal, performing only an import.\n- The main concern is obfuscated or autogenerated package/module names, which could be used to hide malicious code.\n- The use of wildcard imports (`from module import *`) is generally discouraged as it can hide what functions/classes are imported and potentially conceal malicious code.\n- No actual malicious behavior is evident from the import statement alone; further inspection of the package/module contents is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Report-by-Report Review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; import itself doesn't execute code beyond loading.\n- **Anomalies:** Package name suspicious; wildcard import noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately cautious; emphasizes need for further inspection.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence (0.4): reasonable given limited info.\n  - Obfuscated (0.7): justified.\n  - Malware (0.2): low, as no malicious activity is shown.\n  - Security Risk (0.2): low to moderate, mainly due to obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues with scoring; consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated package name, suspicious but not conclusive.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly cautious, noting obfuscation as a potential tactic.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Confidence (0.4): appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated (0.7): justified.\n  - Malware (0): no evidence.\n  - Security Risk (0.3): slightly higher due to suspicion.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard import and hash-like package name.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriate caution; no direct malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Confidence (0.6): slightly higher, justified by the obfuscated naming.\n  - Obfuscated (0.3): lower than others, which is acceptable.\n  - Malware (0): no evidence.\n  - Security Risk (0.2): low.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated module name, wildcard import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior evident; cautious about obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Confidence (0.4): reasonable.\n  - Obfuscated (0.7): justified.\n  - Malware (0): appropriate.\n  - Security Risk (0.2): low.\n\n**Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated package name, wildcard import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly cautious, emphasizing potential concealment.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Confidence (0.6): justified.\n  - Obfuscated (0.7): justified.\n  - Malware (0.2): low.\n  - Security Risk (0.4): slightly higher, reasonable given obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- All reports recognize the obfuscated or autogenerated package/module names as suspicious but do not present evidence of malicious code.\n- The malware scores are low across all reports, which is appropriate given the information.\n- The obfuscated scores are high, correctly reflecting suspicion due to naming.\n- The security risk scores are generally low to moderate, aligning with the cautious stance.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given only import statements and obfuscated names, **0.2** seems appropriate. No evidence of malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The package/module names are clearly obfuscated or autogenerated, so **0.7** remains justified.\n- **Risk Score:** Considering the potential for obfuscation to hide malicious code but no actual malicious activity, **0.2-0.3** is suitable. I would set it at **0.2** to stay conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent in identifying obfuscation but lack evidence of malicious activity.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments necessary unless further evidence emerges.\n- The primary concern remains the obfuscated package/module names and wildcard imports, which warrant further inspection of the actual package contents.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The import statement itself is not malicious but warrants caution. Further analysis should include inspecting the contents of `'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445'` and its `'calculator'` module to confirm whether any malicious code exists.",
