  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the 'calculator' module within the 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading the module 'calculator' from the package 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; however, the imported module could contain functions that execute untrusted code or perform malicious actions when used.",
  "flows": "The import statement itself does not execute code beyond loading the module; potential malicious flows depend on how the imported functions are used later.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' appears obfuscated or autogenerated, which can be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The import statement uses a wildcard import, which can hide the actual functions imported and may complicate analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a potentially obfuscated package. Without additional context, it's unclear what functions or code are included. The package name could suggest an attempt to obscure the code or avoid detection. The import alone does not indicate malicious behavior but warrants further investigation into the contents of the package. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code in this snippet alone. The use of wildcard import is a practice that can hide malicious code if present, but the import statement itself is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement from an obfuscated-looking package, which could be benign or malicious depending on the package contents. Further analysis of the package's code is necessary to determine any malicious intent.",
