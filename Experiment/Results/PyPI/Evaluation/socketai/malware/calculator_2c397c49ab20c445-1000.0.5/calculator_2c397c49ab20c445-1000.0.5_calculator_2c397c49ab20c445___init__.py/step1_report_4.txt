  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the module 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the module 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present in this snippet; potential risk depends on subsequent usage of imported entities.",
  "flows": "Data flow depends on how imported functions/classes are used later; no direct source-to-sink flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly obfuscated or auto-generated module name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' may indicate obfuscation or packaging artifacts; no suspicious code behavior is apparent in this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that imports everything from a module with a complex, hash-like name. This pattern could be indicative of code obfuscation or auto-generated modules, which sometimes hide malicious intent, but on its own, it is not necessarily malicious. No other code or context is provided to evaluate data flows or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. However, the unusual module name warrants caution, and further analysis of the actual imported code is recommended. Overall, the snippet itself appears benign.",
