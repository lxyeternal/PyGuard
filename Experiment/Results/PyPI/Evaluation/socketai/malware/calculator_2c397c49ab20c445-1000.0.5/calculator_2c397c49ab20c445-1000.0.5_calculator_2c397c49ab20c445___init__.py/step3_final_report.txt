{
  "purpose": "Import all functions/classes from 'calculator' module within the obfuscated package 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the package 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' and its 'calculator' module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the imported module contains malicious code, it could execute upon import or later during use; however, the import statement itself is benign.",
  "flows": "The source is the package/module name; the sink is the imported module's code execution during import or subsequent use.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' appears obfuscated or autogenerated; the use of wildcard import ('*') can hide which functions are imported, potentially concealing malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from an obfuscated package with a hash-like name, which raises suspicion but does not itself execute malicious code. The wildcard import ('*') can hide imported functions, making it harder to audit. The scores assigned in the reports reflect high suspicion due to obfuscation (around 0.7), but low malware likelihood (around 0.2), given the lack of evidence of malicious activity in the import statement. The overall security risk remains moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but no direct malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is not inherently malicious but warrants further inspection of the package contents. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and malware scores are appropriately low. The code's benign appearance suggests that the primary concern is obfuscated naming, which could hide malicious code if present. Further analysis of the 'calculator' module within the package is recommended to confirm safety.",
