{
  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the 'calculator' module within the 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' and imports from its 'calculator' module.",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself does not directly involve sinks or untrusted data flows; however, importing modules can lead to execution of code within those modules.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code only performs an import; potential execution depends on the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' appears obfuscated or dynamically generated, which can be suspicious. The use of a long, seemingly random string suggests possible obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import statement, importing everything from a module named 'calculator' inside a package with a complex, seemingly random name. Such naming may indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or to evade detection. Without inspecting the content of the imported module, it is impossible to determine if malicious code is present. The code itself is minimal and standard in structure but raises suspicion due to obfuscated naming. No other code or context is provided, limiting the assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic import with suspicious package naming, which could be a tactic to hide malicious modules. However, without analyzing the imported module's content, no definitive malicious behavior can be confirmed. The snippet alone is not inherently malicious but warrants caution due to obfuscated naming.",
