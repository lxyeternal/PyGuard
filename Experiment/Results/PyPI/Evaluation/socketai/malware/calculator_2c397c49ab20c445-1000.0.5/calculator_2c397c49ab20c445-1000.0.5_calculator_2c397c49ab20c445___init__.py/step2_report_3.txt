  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores based on the information provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator'`\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated package name, wildcard import, potential for hidden malicious functions, but no direct evidence.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Confidence:** 0.4 (moderate confidence)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (high obfuscation)\n  - **Malware:** 0.2 (low, based on import alone)\n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.2 (low, import itself isn't risky)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the scores. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware score remains low due to lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar suspicion due to obfuscated package name, high obfuscation, but no evidence of malware.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Confidence:** 0.4\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.3 (slightly higher, reflecting suspicion)\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator'`\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—obfuscated package, wildcard import, no direct malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Confidence:** 0.6 (higher, perhaps due to the wildcard import)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.3 (less obfuscated than others)\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The lower obfuscation score seems inconsistent with the suspicion raised in analysis. Given the obfuscated nature, I suggest increasing the obfuscated score to **0.6** to reflect the suspicion more accurately. The malware score remains appropriate at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445.calculator'`\n- **Analysis:** Similar obfuscation pattern, no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Confidence:** 0.4\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same import pattern.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated package, wildcard import, potential concealment, but no direct evidence.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Confidence:** 0.6\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n  - **Malware:** 0.2\n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.4 (higher, reflecting suspicion)\n\n**Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified. The malware score remains low, as no evidence is provided. The security risk score is appropriately elevated due to obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All are low (0.2 or 0), which aligns with the fact that import statements alone do not indicate malicious behavior. However, the use of obfuscated package names and wildcard imports warrants cautious suspicion but not definitive malware presence.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** Most are high (0.7), which is justified given the package naming patterns. For Report 3, I recommend increasing the obfuscated score from 0.3 to **0.6** to better reflect the suspicion.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Generally low, but slightly higher where suspicion is noted.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.2 — the import statements alone do not suggest malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 — given the obfuscated package names and wildcard imports, suspicion is justified.\n- **Risk:** 0.3 — moderate due to obfuscation but no direct malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The scores are mostly reasonable, but **Report 3** should have its obfuscated score increased to **0.6**.\n- The malware scores remain low across all reports, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- The overall concern should be to review the actual contents of the imported modules rather than the import statements alone.\n\n**Final note:** The import statements themselves are not malicious but should prompt further inspection of the package contents, especially given the obfuscated naming conventions.",
