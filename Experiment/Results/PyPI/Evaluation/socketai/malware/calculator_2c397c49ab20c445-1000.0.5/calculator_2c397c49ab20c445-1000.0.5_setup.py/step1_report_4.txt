  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445', specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version and description, 'setup()' function call, 'find_packages()', and 'install_requires' list.",
  "targets": "The package installation process and dependency management system.",
  "flows": "Constants (VERSION, DESCRIPTION) are used in 'setup()' to define package metadata; 'install_requires' specifies dependencies like 'requests'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures. The package name appears as a hash-like string, which could be for obscurity but not necessarily malicious. No suspicious behavior detected in package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines basic package metadata, including version, description, author, and dependencies. The description mentions 'Dependency Confusion POC', which could be a note about a security concern but does not indicate malicious code within this script. The code is straightforward and uses standard practices. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The package name is unusual but not inherently malicious. The 'install_requires' list is safe, containing only the 'requests' library. The classifiers specify development status and supported Python versions, which are typical.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The mention of 'Dependency Confusion POC' might indicate the package was created as a proof of concept, but the code itself does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
