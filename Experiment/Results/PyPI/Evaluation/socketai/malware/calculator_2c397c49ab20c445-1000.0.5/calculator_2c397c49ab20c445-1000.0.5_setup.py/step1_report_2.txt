{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445', primarily to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, author info), package discovery via find_packages(), and dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; the script mainly prepares package info for distribution.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining variables and package setup parameters to executing the setup() function, which processes the package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears obfuscated ('calculator_2c397c49ab20c445'), which may indicate an attempt to disguise the package's purpose. The description 'Dependency Confusion POC' suggests potential malicious intent related to supply chain attacks. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The script itself is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file used to package a Python project. The notable aspect is the package name and description implying a proof-of-concept for dependency confusion, a common supply chain attack vector. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present in this script. The dependencies are standard ('requests') without suspicious sources. The obfuscated package name could be used to trick users into installing malicious or unintended packages if exploited in combination with malicious dependencies or repository hijacking. Overall, this code is benign on its own but contextually could be part of a malicious supply chain setup due to its descriptive naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a standard setup script with no direct malicious behavior. The naming and description raise suspicion of a potential supply chain attack vector. There are no signs of malware or malicious code embedded within this script, but the package name and description suggest it may be used in a malicious context when combined with other compromised elements.",
