  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no malicious code or obfuscation is present within the code itself. The main concern lies in the package name and description, which could be exploited in supply chain attacks if misused. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation score around 0.2, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) is appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is safe, but the naming and description should be scrutinized if used in production or uploaded to repositories."
