  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package name, description, author info, dependencies in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or dynamic data; static metadata only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears obfuscated or generated; description contains typo 'Dependecy'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no embedded malicious code, dynamic execution, or network activity. The package name 'calculator_2c397c49ab20c445' suggests obfuscation or generation, which could be used to evade detection. The description 'Dependecy Confusion POC' indicates awareness of supply chain attack techniques but does not constitute malicious behavior itself. All reports correctly assign malware score 0, reflecting no malicious code. Slight variations in obfuscation and risk scores are justified by the suspicious naming and description, which could be exploited in malicious contexts such as dependency confusion attacks. The code's benign nature is confirmed, but the contextual suspicion warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no malicious code or obfuscation is present within the code itself. The main concern lies in the package name and description, which could be exploited in supply chain attacks if misused. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation score around 0.2, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) is appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is safe, but the naming and description should be scrutinized if used in production or uploaded to repositories.",
