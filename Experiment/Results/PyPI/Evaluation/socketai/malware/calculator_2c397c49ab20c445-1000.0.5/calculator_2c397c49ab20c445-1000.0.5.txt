      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; no malicious code or obfuscation is present within the code itself. The main concern lies in the package name and description, which could be exploited in supply chain attacks if misused. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation score around 0.2, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3) is appropriate given the context. Overall, the code is safe, but the naming and description should be scrutinized if used in production or uploaded to repositories."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by transmitting system info during a calculator operation, which could be used for tracking or data theft. No malicious payloads are present, but the activity is privacy-invasive. The malware score should be moderate (~0.4-0.5), and the security risk score high (~0.7), reflecting the privacy concern. The code should be flagged for review or removal if unintended. Overall, the behavior is suspicious but not outright malicious payloads are detected."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The import statement is not inherently malicious but warrants further inspection of the package contents. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and malware scores are appropriately low. The code's benign appearance suggests that the primary concern is obfuscated naming, which could hide malicious code if present. Further analysis of the 'calculator' module within the package is recommended to confirm safety."
