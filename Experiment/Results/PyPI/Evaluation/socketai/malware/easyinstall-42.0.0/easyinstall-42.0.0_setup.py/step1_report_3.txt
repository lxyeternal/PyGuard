{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it includes additional functionality that downloads and executes external code, which suggests malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote server at IP 145.249.104.71 via HTTP(S) request in the 'rn' function.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is written directly to a file named '.drv', which is then made executable and run in the background. It also appends a command to '~/.bashrc' to execute this file on startup.",
  "flows": "The code fetches remote data from the IP, writes it to '.drv', sets executable permissions, modifies '~/.bashrc' to run '.drv', and executes it asynchronously via a new thread.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address, direct download of executable-like content, modification of user shell configuration, and background execution of fetched code are highly suspicious behaviors. The code bypasses normal setup procedures and performs network operations and system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script's primary function appears to be fetching external data from a specific IP address and executing it without validation, which is characteristic of malicious activity. It modifies user environment files to ensure persistence and runs downloaded code covertly. The presence of a remote IP and the execution pattern strongly indicate malicious intent, possibly to establish backdoor access or persist malicious code. The setup function, which normally should only handle package installation, is used here as a facade for malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior. It downloads code from an external IP, writes and executes it covertly, and modifies user environment files for persistence. It does not align with standard package setup procedures and exhibits multiple red flags indicative of supply chain sabotage.",
