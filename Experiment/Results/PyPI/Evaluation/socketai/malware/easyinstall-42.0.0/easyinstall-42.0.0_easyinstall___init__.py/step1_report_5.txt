{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python module designed for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, depending on usage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network or filesystem operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Unusual language features or unnecessary dynamic execution are absent. No suspicious functions like exec or eval are found.",
  "analysis": "The code structure appears typical for a utility module, with clear function definitions and standard library usage. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident. The absence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent. Code analysis is limited to the visible code, with no external dependencies indicating suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility or processing module with no evident supply chain security threats.",
