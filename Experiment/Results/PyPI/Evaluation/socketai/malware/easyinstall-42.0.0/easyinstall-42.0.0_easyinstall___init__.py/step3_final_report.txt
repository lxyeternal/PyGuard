  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, input functions, network connections, file operations, or data handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to network transmission, file modification, or environment variable access that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may then reach sinks like network senders or file writers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code constructs detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as a standard utility with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No actual code snippets show malicious patterns. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with a benign utility, considering potential external interactions. The confidence levels are high where code is described, lower where no code is provided, aligning with cautious assessment. Overall, the analysis indicates no malicious or obfuscated code present, and low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
