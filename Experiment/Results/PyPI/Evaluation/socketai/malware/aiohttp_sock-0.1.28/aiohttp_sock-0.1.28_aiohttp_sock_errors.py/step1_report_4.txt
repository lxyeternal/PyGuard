{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code; only class definitions are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present; the code only defines exception classes without any data handling or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no input, output, or data processing statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for various SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exception types. There is no logic, data handling, or potential malicious activity present. It appears to be a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a custom exception hierarchy for SOCKS proxy error handling and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
