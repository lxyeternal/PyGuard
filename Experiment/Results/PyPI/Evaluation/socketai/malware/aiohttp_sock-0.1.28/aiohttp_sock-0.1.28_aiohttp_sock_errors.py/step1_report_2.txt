{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and authentication failures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; exception class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external communication.",
  "flows": "None, as these are just class definitions with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy operations. It includes a hierarchy of exception classes with no functional code, data handling, or logic that could be exploited or manipulated. The classes are straightforward, inheriting from built-in exception types, and do not contain any executable statements or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be standard, static exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception class definitions with no executable logic or data handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is benign and serves as a foundation for handling SOCKS proxy errors.",
