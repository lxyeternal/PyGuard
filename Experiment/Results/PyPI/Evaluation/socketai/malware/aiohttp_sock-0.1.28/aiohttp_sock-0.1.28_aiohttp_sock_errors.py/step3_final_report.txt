  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and OSError, no external input or data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Static class inheritance hierarchy; no data flow or execution flow beyond class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of exception class declarations with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static class definitions for various SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard exception classes. There is no runtime logic, data processing, or external data input. The code is straightforward, benign, and serves as error handling scaffolding. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and static nature justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the clarity and lack of complexity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
