  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- They consistently note the absence of data processing, external input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected across all reports.\n- The code appears static, benign, and serves as scaffolding for error handling.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code matches the descriptions; it only defines exception classes without any runtime logic or data flow.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the static class definitions.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, static class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable as there are no security risks.\n\n**Potential points of critique:**\n- Since all reports are consistent and accurate, no adjustments are necessary.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified, as the analysis is thorough and correct.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- I concur with the reports' conclusions and scores.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and well-understood.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
