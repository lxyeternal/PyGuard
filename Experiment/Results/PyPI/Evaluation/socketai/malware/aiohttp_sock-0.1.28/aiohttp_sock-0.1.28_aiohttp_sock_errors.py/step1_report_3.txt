  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that are static, no input reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as this is only exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are simple custom exceptions with no additional logic or data.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears to serve as part of a larger system, focusing on error handling for SOCKS proxy interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present in this static, structural code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for error handling related to SOCKS proxy operations. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
