  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no data flows, external data handling, or executable logic.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - **No issues found here.**\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself show no signs of malicious behavior, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - **No justification needed for higher scores.**\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The code contains no malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate and justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as static exception class definitions.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - The assessments align with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would agree with the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.**",
