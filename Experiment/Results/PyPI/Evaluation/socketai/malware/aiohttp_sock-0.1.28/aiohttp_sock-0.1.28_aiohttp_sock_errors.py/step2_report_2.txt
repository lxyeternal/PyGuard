  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No external data handling, dynamic behavior, or executable logic is present.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as error handling scaffolding.\n   - No logical errors or misleading claims are apparent.\n   - The conclusions are justified given the static nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign, static class definitions.\n   - The `confidence` score of 1 across all reports is justified, as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no executable or malicious elements, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly assign low risk scores, aligning with the actual content.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct and justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the reports focus on the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - All assessments are based on observable code structure.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, just acknowledging the code's presence) but effectively 0 for security risk\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The exception hierarchy is typical and harmless.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores; no risk is associated with this code snippet.",
