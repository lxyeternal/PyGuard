  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to SOCKS proxy operations and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes without reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely declarative, defining exception classes without any data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard for defining exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for various SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors. There are no data inputs, no data processing, and no external communications or dangerous behaviors. All classes are simple subclasses of built-in exceptions with no added logic or data. This structure is typical for error handling in larger systems. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy error handling with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not process external data or perform any risky operations.",
