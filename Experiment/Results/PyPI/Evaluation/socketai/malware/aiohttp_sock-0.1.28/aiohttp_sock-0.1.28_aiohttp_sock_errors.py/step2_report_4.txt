  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - No external data, dynamic code, or executable logic is present.\n   - The code is benign and standard for error handling purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The summaries are comprehensive and aligned with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is purely definitional, no higher risk scores are warranted.\n   - The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, so the risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n   - No hidden or obfuscated malicious code is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as static exception class definitions.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious intents are suggested.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My Own Estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves as a foundational error handling component. The scores in the reports are justified and should remain as they are.",
