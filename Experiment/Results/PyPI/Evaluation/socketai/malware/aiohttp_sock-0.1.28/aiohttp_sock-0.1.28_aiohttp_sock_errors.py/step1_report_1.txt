  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static and do not process external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as these are just exception class declarations with no runtime execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, secrets, or dynamic code execution; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types, intended to handle specific SOCKS proxy error scenarios. There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flow mechanisms. The code is straightforward and serves as error handling scaffolding without any malicious or suspicious elements. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for error handling related to SOCKS proxies. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
