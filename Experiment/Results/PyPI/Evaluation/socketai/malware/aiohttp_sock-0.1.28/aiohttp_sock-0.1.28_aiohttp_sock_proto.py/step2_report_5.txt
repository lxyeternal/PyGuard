  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It notes proper handling of SOCKS protocols, authentication, and error management.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the benign analysis.\n- **Justification for scores:** The report's confidence is high (0.9), and no suspicious behaviors are identified. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** The analysis appears accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes standard implementation, proper protocol adherence, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code's structure and behavior do not suggest malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** The report's scoring and reasoning are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 — very low, indicating minimal concern.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- **Verdict:** The evaluation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, it finds no malicious activity, with proper handling of network communication.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose and implementation align with standard proxy client behavior.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scoring is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms a legitimate SOCKS proxy wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code's logic and structure are standard, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's purpose and the absence of suspicious patterns, a malware score of **0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) in all reports, reflecting minimal security concerns. Since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected, a risk score of **0.1–0.2** remains appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minor, general security risk, consistent with the reports.\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the code's benign nature.",
