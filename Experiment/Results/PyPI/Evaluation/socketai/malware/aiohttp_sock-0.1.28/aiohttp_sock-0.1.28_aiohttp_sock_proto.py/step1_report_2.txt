  "purpose": "Implementations of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy socket wrappers for asynchronous network connections",
  "sources": "Reads include host, port, user credentials, address resolution, and network requests via socket and asyncio methods",
  "sinks": "Network connections to proxy server and destination, socket data transmissions, and address resolution results",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (host, port, credentials) through address resolution, socket connection, and SOCKS negotiation procedures",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard socket and asyncio methods. No suspicious data leaks or obfuscated code. No external network requests outside specified proxy communication.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an asynchronous interface to connect through SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies, handling address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation. It correctly uses asyncio event loops and socket methods for network operations, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network channels, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious flows observed. Error handling appears standard and appropriate. The code does not contain obfuscation, malware, or suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy socket wrappers with no indications of malicious intent. It follows expected patterns for proxy communication, security, and error handling, with no malicious or sabotage behavior detected.",
