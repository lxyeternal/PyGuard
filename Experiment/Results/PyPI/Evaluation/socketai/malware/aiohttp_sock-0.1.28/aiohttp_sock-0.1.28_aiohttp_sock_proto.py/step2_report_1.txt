  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, with support for authentication, address resolution, and network communication.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The code uses asyncio for asynchronous socket operations, following typical patterns.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident.\n- The malware scores are uniformly 0, and the obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence Confirmation**\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** The code appears to implement the described SOCKS proxy wrappers correctly, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**\n\n- **Are there any flaws or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports' reasoning aligns with the code's structure and purpose. They correctly identify the code as a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Review and Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable considering the code's function. Since it's a proxy client, potential misuse could exist if exploited, but no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- **Risk Score (general security risk):**  \n  The scores seem reasonable, given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume that the code is only a proxy client implementation without malicious intent.  \n- There are no claims or evidence of hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency and Reasonableness**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment and Recommendations**\n\n- **Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n  - **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n  - **Risk Score:** **0.1** (low, standard proxy client, minimal security concern)\n\n- **Additional comments:**  \n  The code is a standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity. The scores are appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malware or obfuscation. The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.",
