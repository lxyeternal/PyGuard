{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy client wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, facilitating connections through proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include host and port parameters for proxy and destination addresses, environment for address resolution, and optional user credentials for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network socket operations (sock_connect, sock_sendall, sock_recv), especially where untrusted data might influence connection parameters or be transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through address resolution and authentication procedures, then to socket connection and data transmission; particularly, credential data and address data are processed before network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution patterns are present. Error handling is standard. The code does use some encode/decode for hostnames and addresses, but this is typical for proxy implementations. There are no suspicious or hidden behaviors or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines proxy connection classes with explicit, documented behavior for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It performs address resolution, authentication, and connection negotiation using standard socket and asyncio APIs. Error handling aligns with expected network error patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The implementation appears focused solely on establishing proxy connections. The absence of code injection, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system access indicates no malicious intent. Overall, the code demonstrates proper security practices for a proxy client wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows typical patterns for network communication, error handling, and proxy negotiation, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious logic detected.",
