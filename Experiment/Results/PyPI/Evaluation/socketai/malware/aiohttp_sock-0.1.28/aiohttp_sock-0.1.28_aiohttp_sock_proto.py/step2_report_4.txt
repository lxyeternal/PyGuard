  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy wrappers with authentication, error handling, and address resolution. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard, well-structured, and does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated features. The risk score is low, reflecting typical proxy client usage.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing correct implementation, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code; no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SOCKS proxy implementation with proper handling, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; the code appears legitimate and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard, secure SOCKS proxy wrappers with no malicious or obfuscated features.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues identified; the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a standard implementation with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code snippets provided are consistent with typical SOCKS proxy client implementations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent. Exception handling appears appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** No obfuscation or malware traits are detected across reports.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which is justified given the code. Risk scores are low, reflecting typical proxy client usage with minimal inherent risk.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code follows standard protocols.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal risk, typical for proxy client libraries.\n\n**Overall:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Confirmed issues:** None.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1–0.2.\n- **Justification:** Based on the code's clarity, adherence to protocol standards, and lack of suspicious features.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
