{
  "purpose": "This code implements proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling connections through proxies with support for authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Host and port parameters for destination and proxy; socket connection functions; environment variables are not directly used.",
  "sinks": "Network socket operations for connecting, sending, and receiving data; potentially sending data over network connections.",
  "flows": "Input host/port data are used to resolve addresses, then sent through proxy negotiation steps, leading to network socket communication; no untrusted data flow directly into critical system functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found; no suspicious backdoors or unusual code behaviors; code appears to follow standard SOCKS protocol implementations. No obfuscated code or malicious instructions are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy clients for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols. It handles network communication, address resolution, and optional authentication, all consistent with protocol specifications. No suspicious or malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are detected. The code uses asyncio for asynchronous network I/O, with proper error handling. There are no hardcoded credentials or external data flows that could indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates within expected parameters for proxy negotiation and data forwarding, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
