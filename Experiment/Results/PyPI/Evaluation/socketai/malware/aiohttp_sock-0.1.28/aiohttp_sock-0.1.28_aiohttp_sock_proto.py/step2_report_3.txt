  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports conclude that the code is a standard implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The code appears correct and aligns with standard protocol specifications.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the absence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - They correctly identify that the code handles address resolution, authentication, and network communication appropriately.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores around 0.1–0.2, which are reasonable given the code's purpose.\n   - The confidence levels are high (0.9–0.95), reflecting the reviewers' certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.5. The highest is 0.2, which is appropriate considering the code's purpose and the lack of malicious indicators.\n   - The low risk scores are justified because the code performs legitimate proxy functions without any suspicious features.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious operations such as data exfiltration, code injection, or remote command execution.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis, protocol adherence, and the absence of suspicious patterns.\n   - They acknowledge the standard nature of the implementation.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk, and high confidence in the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code appears clear and standard, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk Score**: 0.1 — Very low, reflecting the minimal security concern of a proxy client library.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, with proper handling of authentication, address resolution, and network communication. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk remains minimal, and the code appears safe for use in proxy-related applications.",
