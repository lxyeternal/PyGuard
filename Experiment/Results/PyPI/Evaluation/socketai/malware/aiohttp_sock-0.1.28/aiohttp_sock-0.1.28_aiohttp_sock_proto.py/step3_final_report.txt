  "purpose": "Implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers supporting authentication, address resolution, and network communication.",
  "sources": "Input hostnames, ports, and optional user credentials; socket data streams during connection and data transfer.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets for connecting to proxy servers and remote destinations; data sent over sockets.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) -> socket connection -> proxy negotiation -> data transmission between client and destination.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code follows standard protocol implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients using asyncio. It handles address resolution, authentication, and error management appropriately. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
