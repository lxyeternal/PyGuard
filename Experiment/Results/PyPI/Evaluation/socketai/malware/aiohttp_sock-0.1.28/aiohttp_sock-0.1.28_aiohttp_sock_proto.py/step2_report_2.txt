  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers using asyncio, with support for address resolution, optional authentication, and proper error handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code are evident.\n- The code aligns with standard protocol specifications and appears to serve as a legitimate proxy client library.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The malware scores are all 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no suspicion of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes SOCKS proxy wrappers, including authentication.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2 (low).\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, well-founded.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Standard SOCKS proxy implementation, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Standard, legitimate proxy wrapper code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly vary between 0.1 and 0.2; current values are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.** No changes are necessary. The code appears safe, well-implemented, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the detailed reasoning above.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The thorough review confirms that the code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
