{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse SOCKS proxy URLs, create appropriate socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, and establish network connections via these proxies using asyncio.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL components (scheme, host, port, user info), input parameters for host and port, environment for asyncio event loop",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections established via asyncio, socket wrappers connecting to proxies",
  "flows": "Input proxy URL or parameters → parse_proxy_url → create_socket_wrapper → connect → asyncio.open_connection or loop.create_connection",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Minor exception handling could be more explicit for None values in URL user info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for SOCKS proxy connection management, utilizing well-known libraries and proper validation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is appropriate, though explicit handling of None for URL user info could be improved. The code's purpose is benign, facilitating proxy connections, which could be misused but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented SOCKS proxy connection utility with no malicious or suspicious elements. Its potential for misuse does not reflect on its inherent security. Scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
