{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters such as raw_url in parse_proxy_url(), user credentials (username, password), host, port, and optional SOCKS proxy URLs.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into socket connection methods (sock.connect, asyncio.open_connection, loop.create_connection), which can send or receive network data; user credentials can be used for authentication if provided.",
  "flows": "Input data from proxy URL parsing and function parameters flow into socket creation and connection functions, ultimately establishing network connections through proxies, which can send/receive data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code strictly handles network connection setup via proxies. Exception handling for invalid input is present. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly parses proxy URLs, handling both host and port extraction, including user credentials. It creates SOCKS proxy wrappers depending on the specified proxy type, and establishes network connections via these proxies using asyncio. There are proper error checks for missing parameters and invalid inputs. The functions rely on standard libraries and well-known third-party modules, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected. The credential handling appears to be intended for proxy authentication and not for malicious data theft. The overall structure aligns with legitimate network connection routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy connection utilities for asyncio-based Python programs. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies are evident. It handles user credentials and network connections in a typical manner without hidden or harmful functionalities.",
