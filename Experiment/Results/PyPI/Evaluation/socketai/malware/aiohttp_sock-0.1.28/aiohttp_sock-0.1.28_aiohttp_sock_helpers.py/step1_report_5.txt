{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and open network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting URL parsing and asyncio-based connection handling.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url() reads proxy URLs; open_connection() and create_connection() read host, port, socks_url, and optional parameters.",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection() and loop.create_connection() send data over network sockets; socket.connect() establishes connections.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing and parameter inputs (sources) lead to socket creation via create_socket_wrapper(), then connections are established with socket.connect(), and finally data transfer occurs via open_connection() or create_connection().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; usage of third-party libraries appears standard; no suspicious network activity or data leaks observed; code structure straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code handles network connection setup via SOCKS proxies with options for different proxy types and URL parsing. It uses standard asyncio functions and socket wrappers. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors. The functions include input validation, proper error handling, and standard library usage. No obfuscated or malicious code is detected. The proxy URL parsing extracts credentials and connection info securely. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe for intended purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of asyncio-based SOCKS proxy connection handling without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain malware or security risks. The structure and logic are straightforward, with no suspicious signals.",
