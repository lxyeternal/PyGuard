{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and manage network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5, for use in asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads proxy URLs via the parse_proxy_url function, user input for host, port, username, password, and optional SOCKS URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code establishes network connections using create_socket_wrapper and asyncio.open_connection or loop.create_connection, which involve socket connections and data transfer.",
  "flows": "Input data such as proxy URLs and connection parameters flow into parsing functions, which set up proxy socket wrappers, then connect to target hosts via SOCKS proxies, culminating in open_connection or create_connection functions that establish the actual network streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are present. The code handles URL parsing and network socket creation in a standard manner, with appropriate exception handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. No suspicious data leaks, code injection, or system harm actions are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for establishing network connections through SOCKS proxies, with functions for parsing proxy URLs, creating socket wrappers, and connecting asynchronously. It validates input parameters, handles proxy URL parsing, and manages socket connections properly. It does not contain hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads. Usage of standard libraries and proper exception handling indicate normal operation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for proxy-based network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured network utility for establishing SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It functions as intended without evident security threats.",
