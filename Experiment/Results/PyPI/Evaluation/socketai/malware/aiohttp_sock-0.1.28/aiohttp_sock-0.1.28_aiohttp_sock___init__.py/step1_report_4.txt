{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that provides proxy connection functionality, including handling different proxy types and errors related to socks proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), reading from the package's internal modules",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations directly",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code identified",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements, version declaration, and the __all__ list to define module exports. It does not contain logic, user input handling, or external network interactions. No apparent malicious behaviors or malicious code structures are present. The module appears to be a straightforward part of a larger proxy connection library, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module that organizes imports and exports for a proxy connection library. No signs of malicious activity, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks are detected.",
