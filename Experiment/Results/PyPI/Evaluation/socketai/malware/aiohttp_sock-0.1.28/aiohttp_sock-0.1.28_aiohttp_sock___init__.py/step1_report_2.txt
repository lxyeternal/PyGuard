{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a proxy client library, providing connectors, error handling, helpers, and protocol definitions for establishing proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto; constant __version__",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network calls, no data leaks, no external data writes",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from source inputs to sinks; primarily defining and exporting classes, functions, and constants",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, primarily importing and exporting modules; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports specific classes and functions from relative modules, sets version and export variables, and does not perform any runtime operations or data handling. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a proxy library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any active data processing, network activity, or potential backdoors. Likely safe in the context of a larger project.",
