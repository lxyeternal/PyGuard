{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python module that defines and exports classes, functions, and constants related to proxy connections, likely for a proxy client or server implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), potentially user input or network data handled within those modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in this snippet; potential data flow would occur within imported modules, especially in connection handling functions or classes.",
  "flows": "Data flows would originate from input sources like network or user input and be processed or forwarded through the imported modules, but no direct flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present in this fragment; it contains standard import and export statements with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and functions from local files and defines an __all__ list for export. No code execution, data handling, or sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues within this snippet. The code is well-structured, intended for modular use, and does not contain any suspicious or anomalous constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, benign module setup for a proxy-related package, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It primarily organizes exports for external use.",
