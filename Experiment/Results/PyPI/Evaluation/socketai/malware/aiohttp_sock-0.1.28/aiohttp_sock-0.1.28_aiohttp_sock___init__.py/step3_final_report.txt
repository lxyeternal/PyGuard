{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer for a Python package, importing and exporting components related to proxy connections and errors without executing any logic or handling untrusted data.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto)",
  "sinks": "No data processing, network communication, or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statements and symbol exports without data flow or external data sources",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export structure, no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module setup, importing specific classes and functions from local modules and defining __all__ for exports. There are no runtime operations, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The absence of any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign purpose. The minimal risk scores assigned in the reports (mostly 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the code's simplicity. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present, and the code aligns with typical package initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module setup with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are correct, and the risk scores could be further lowered to zero, reflecting the absence of security concerns.",
