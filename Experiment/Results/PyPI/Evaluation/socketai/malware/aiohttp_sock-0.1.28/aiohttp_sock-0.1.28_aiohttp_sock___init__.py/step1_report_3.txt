{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface for a proxy connection library, providing imports, versioning, and exports for other modules to use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: connector, errors, helpers, proto",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to critical functions or untrusted sinks; the code only imports and re-exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The script primarily re-exports classes, functions, and constants from internal modules. It defines a version string and a list of exports. No data processing, input handling, or network communication occurs here. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard for a library's __init__.py or module entry point.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes components for use by other parts of the project.",
