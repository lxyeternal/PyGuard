{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export components related to proxy connection handling, such as connectors, errors, helpers, and protocol types, likely as part of a proxy client or server library.",
  "sources": "No direct sources of untrusted data input are present; the code mainly imports modules and defines exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no evident data flows from sources to sinks within this fragment; it mainly sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, involving imports, error definitions, and module exports. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a typical module initialization file, importing various components from local modules and defining what symbols are exported. There are no suspicious operations, data processing, or external communications. The structure and syntax are normal for Python package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
