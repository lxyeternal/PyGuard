  "purpose": "Define a custom proxy connector class for HTTP and other protocols, with support for no resolver and proxy URL parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (host, port, username, password, proxy URL), class attributes, environment variables (not explicitly used here).",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections, proxy URL construction, connection methods calling network functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, username, password, proxy URL) -> proxy_url property (constructs URL) -> socket connection functions -> network connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials found; the code constructs URLs from parameters, which are not sanitized or validated here. No obvious backdoors or unusual behaviors. The code handles network connection setup via sockets and proxies without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a proxy connector for aiohttp, allowing configurable proxy settings and custom resolver. It constructs proxy URLs dynamically based on provided parameters, and manages socket connections, including support for RDNS and non-HTTP proxies. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are detected. The usage of socket wrappers and URL parsing appears standard and benign. No sensitive data is hardcoded; the code relies on external inputs for credentials and proxy details. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a customizable proxy connector, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It handles network connections and proxy URL formation securely based on parameters, without evident malicious behavior or data leakage.",
