{
  "purpose": "This code provides test cases for the supply and demand curve classes, as well as their related functions, to ensure correct behavior and calculations within a market simulation module.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules such as pytest, copy, and functions/classes from py_pkg.curves, which supply curve and demand curve data, as well as functions for equilibrium calculations and economic shocks.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to external systems, network, or files are present. The code only performs assertions within tests.",
  "flows": "Test functions create curve objects, invoke methods for quantity calculations, apply economic shocks, and verify behaviors through assertions; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. All code appears standard for a testing suite: use of pytest, assertions, exception testing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No network, system modification, or data exfiltration functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying the functionality of supply and demand curves, including comparison, interpolation, extrapolation, exception handling, and economic shock application. It uses pytest for structured testing, ensuring correct behavior and exception raising for invalid input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or external communication. The code strictly operates within the test environment, calling well-defined classes and functions for market modeling, with no side effects or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign test suite for a market simulation module. It performs standard validation without any malicious intent, external data transmission, or harmful operations. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
