{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based unit tests for supply and demand curve classes and their associated functions, verifying their correctness and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test data within test functions, imported classes and functions from the py_pkg.curves module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or produce output that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Test functions create curve objects, evaluate quantities at specific prices, and compare expected outcomes; no external data flows or system interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for economic supply and demand curves, performing in-memory assertions and exception tests. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or malicious constructs. The data is static, and the functions tested are mathematical and validation routines. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security concerns. All evidence and analysis support a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's purpose is purely for validation of economic models, and it poses no threat.",
