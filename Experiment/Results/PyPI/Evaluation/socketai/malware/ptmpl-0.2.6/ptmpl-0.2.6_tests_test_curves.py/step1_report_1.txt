{
  "purpose": "This is a test suite for the curves.py module, verifying the functionality of supply and demand curves and their associated analytics.",
  "sources": "The code reads test data defined within the test functions (e.g., supply_data, demand_data). It also imports functions and classes from the py_pkg.curves module.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that compare curve outputs and properties; no data is written to external systems or files. No apparent sinks that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Test data flows into class constructors and methods; expected outputs are verified via assertions. No flow leads to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears standard for a test suite.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite utilizing pytest for validation of curve classes and functions. It creates and compares supply/demand curves, tests exceptions, and verifies economic analytics. No suspicious data handling, no use of external resources beyond imports, and no dynamic code execution. The test data is hardcoded but within normal testing practices. The code does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It strictly tests computational logic related to economic curves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for economic curve classes and functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It simply verifies the correctness of the supply/demand curve implementations and related calculations.",
