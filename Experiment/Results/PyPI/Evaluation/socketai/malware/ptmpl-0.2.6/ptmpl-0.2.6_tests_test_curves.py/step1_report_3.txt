{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the curves.py module, testing supply and demand curve functionalities, comparisons, and economic calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and fixtures (e.g., supply_curve, demand_curve). It also creates objects and runs assertions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input data or perform dangerous actions such as network requests, file operations, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The data flows involve instantiating supply/demand curves and applying economic shocks, then performing comparisons and calculations. No data is sent or stored externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, involving typical unit tests with assertions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional test suite that exercises the functionality of supply and demand curve classes and related calculations. It includes tests for curve creation, comparison, interpolation, extrapolation, exception handling, and economic shocks. No suspicious or malicious patterns, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The use of pytest and the structure of the tests follow standard practices, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard validation of economic modeling functions without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
