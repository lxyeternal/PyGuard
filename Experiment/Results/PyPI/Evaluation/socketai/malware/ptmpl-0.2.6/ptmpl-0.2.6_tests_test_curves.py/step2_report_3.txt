  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard, well-structured test suite for supply and demand curves.\n- No suspicious behaviors, such as network activity, external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious code, are mentioned.\n- The code only performs in-memory tests, assertions, and exception handling.\n- The test data is hardcoded within the test functions, typical for unit tests.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0, indicating no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The tests verify core functionalities: curve comparison, point evaluation, extrapolation, exception handling, and economic calculations.\n- The code imports from standard libraries and the target module without any external or dynamic code execution.\n- The purpose and analysis in all reports align with a benign testing context.\n\n**Assessment of Scores:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed reviews, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is a straightforward, standard test suite for economic curves, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** These scores are consistent with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured test suite for supply and demand curve models. It performs standard validation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
