{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the curves.py module, testing classes related to supply and demand curves and their analytical functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (copy, pytest), and classes/functions from py_pkg.curves module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified. The code only runs tests and does not perform data output, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities; it solely tests class behaviors and calculations within the module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is a standard test suite with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and runs a series of unit tests on supply and demand curve classes, including comparisons, point evaluations, and extrapolations. It verifies proper exception raising for invalid data and tests analytical functions for equilibrium prices and shocks. All operations are within a controlled test environment, and there are no indications of malicious intent. The code does not handle or transmit external data, nor does it invoke external system commands or network activities. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured test suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for supply/demand curve classes with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It contains no malware, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious network activities. Overall security risk is negligible.",
