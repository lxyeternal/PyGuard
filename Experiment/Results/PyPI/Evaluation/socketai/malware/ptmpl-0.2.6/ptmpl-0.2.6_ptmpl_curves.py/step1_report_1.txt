{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, including classes for curves, calculating equilibrium prices and ranges, and applying economic shocks. It is designed for economic analysis and simulation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for supply and demand curves through constructor parameters, including lists of dictionaries containing price and supply/demand values.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; output functions return computed values or new curve objects. No data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into curve constructors; these data are processed and stored internally. Equilibrium functions read curve data to compute prices. Shock scenarios modify existing curves and return new instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The only dynamic aspect is the application of economic shocks, which is part of normal simulation functionality. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly models economic curves and their interactions, with input validation to prevent invalid data (e.g., zero prices). It raises specific exceptions for non-monotonic curves, which indicates data integrity enforcement. The use of numpy arrays is standard for numerical operations. The shock classes allow for straightforward modification of curves without executing any suspicious or harmful operations. The application of shocks involves simple arithmetic transformations on the input data. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present. All data flows and transformations are related solely to economic modeling, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate economic modeling library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data validation, modeling, and transformation within the expected scope. There are no suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malware indicators. The overall security risk is minimal.",
