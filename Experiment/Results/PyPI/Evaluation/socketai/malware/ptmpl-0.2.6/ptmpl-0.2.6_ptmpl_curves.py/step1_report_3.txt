{
  "purpose": "This code models economic supply and demand curves, including their equilibrium calculations and shock scenarios, primarily for analytical purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input sequences of dictionaries for supply and demand curves; accesses internal attributes of curve objects (e.g., _price, _quantity).",
  "sinks": "Uses input data to create new curve objects; applies shocks that generate new curve objects; performs comparisons and returns values based on these data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into curve constructors; data is sorted and validated; internal arrays are created; functions calculate equilibrium prices; shocks modify curve data; outputs are computed based on these transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Exception classes are standard and straightforward. No suspicious network or file operations detected. The code appears to follow expected patterns for economic modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data validation on supply and demand input data, ensuring monotonicity and non-zero prices. It uses numpy arrays for efficient numerical operations. Equilibrium calculations are based on comparing supply and demand quantities across a price domain. The shock classes modify curve data by translating prices. All operations are mathematical and data-driven with no hidden or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard Python constructs, type annotations, and abstract base classes properly. No external network or file system interactions are present, and no code injection or data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of economic curve modeling with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows good coding practices, performs standard data validation, and does not contain any suspicious activities or malware. It appears to be a legitimate module for economic simulations with a very low malware score.",
