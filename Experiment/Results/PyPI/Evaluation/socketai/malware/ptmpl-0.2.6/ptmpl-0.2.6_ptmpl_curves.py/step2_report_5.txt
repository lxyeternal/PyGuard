  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states modeling of economic curves, input via constructor data, no external sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious indicators. Uses numpy for numerical operations, standard for such modeling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate economic modeling code, minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard data input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, standard numpy usage.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, straightforward implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Slightly higher risk score, but still reasonable given the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous reports, standard data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious behavior, proper validation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected, fits typical economic modeling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, in-memory calculations, no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, well-structured.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, in-memory data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no malicious behavior, clear validation.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently report 0, and the code analysis shows no malicious behavior or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code is straightforward, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1–0.2, which is reasonable given the purely analytical, in-memory, and validation-focused nature of the code.\n\n### My Reasoned Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Very low, as the code performs standard economic modeling with proper validation and no external threats.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and their scores are justified based on the code's functionality and structure. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0.1**  \n\nThis code appears safe, legitimate, and suitable for its intended economic modeling purpose.",
