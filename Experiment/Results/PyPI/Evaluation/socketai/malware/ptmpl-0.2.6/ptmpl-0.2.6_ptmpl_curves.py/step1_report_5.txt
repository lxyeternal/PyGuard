{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and simulates economic shocks. It serves as a library for economic analysis and visualization.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include the 'data' parameter in SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors, which read in price-quantity data points. External data input points are through these constructors when creating curve objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external data transmissions are present. The apply() method in HorizPriceShock creates new curve instances but only from in-memory data, not external sources. No network, file, or environment variable access is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data in the constructors into internal numpy arrays. The apply() methods generate new curve objects with shifted prices based on shock values, relying solely on in-memory data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior is observed. The code contains standard exception handling for monotonicity errors and value validation. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The class and function definitions follow conventional patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines supply and demand curve classes with methods for validation, comparison, and quantity calculation based on price. Custom exceptions are used for monotonicity violations. The equilibrium functions compute prices where supply equals demand using straightforward numpy operations. The class 'Equilibrium' encapsulates the equilibrium state, and 'EconShockScenario' and its subclasses model economic shocks by shifting prices. All data manipulations are in-memory, with no external data or network operations. No code injections, malicious data leaks, or suspicious external interactions are present. The design appears to be a standard economic modeling library with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign economic modeling library with robust input validation, clear structure, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It focuses on in-memory calculations and data modeling without external data leaks or malicious side effects.",
