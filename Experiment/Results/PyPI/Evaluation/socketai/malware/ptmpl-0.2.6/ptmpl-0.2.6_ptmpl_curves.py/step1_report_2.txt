{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, calculates equilibrium prices, and simulates economic shocks, intended for financial or economic analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for supply and demand curves, specifically from the 'data' parameter in class constructors, and numpy arrays for internal calculations.",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy for computations; no external data sinks or network transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures into numpy arrays, then through comparison operations within methods to compute quantities and equilibrium prices; no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. Exception classes are straightforward. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or stealth features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard economic modeling functions: creating supply/demand curves, checking monotonicity, calculating quantities at given prices, and finding equilibrium prices and ranges. Exception handling is used for invalid data (e.g., non-monotonic curves). No suspicious imports or functions. The numpy library is used for array operations, which is standard and not malicious. The classes and functions follow clear, purposeful logic consistent with economic modeling; no hidden or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of supply/demand curve modeling with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs typical calculations for economic analysis, with proper input validation and error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
