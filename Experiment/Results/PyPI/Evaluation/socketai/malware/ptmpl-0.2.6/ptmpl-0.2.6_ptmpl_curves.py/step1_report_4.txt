  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, computes equilibrium prices and ranges, and simulates economic shocks for use in economic analysis or simulations.",
  "sources": "Input data to SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors (sequences of dictionaries with 'price' and 'supply'/'demand' keys), and methods applying shocks or calculations based on these data.",
  "sinks": "The quantity methods in SupplyCurve and DemandCurve, which use input prices to return supply/demand quantities; equil_price and equil_price_ranges functions that perform calculations based on these quantities; the __init__ methods in curves that process input data. No sinks involve untrusted data directly affecting system commands or sensitive outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data -> SupplyCurve/DemandCurve constructors -> quantity methods -> equilibrium functions -> data used in calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Usage of numpy is standard for array operations. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious data handling detected. Exception classes are standard. The apply method in EconShockScenario is straightforward and safe. No dynamic code execution or external system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for supply and demand curves with validation for monotonicity and non-zero prices. It includes functions to compute equilibrium prices and ranges by comparing supply and demand quantities at different prices. The exception classes handle invalid data scenarios. The EconShockScenario abstract class and its implementations allow for shifting curves via shocks. All data processing is confined to mathematical calculations and data transformations with no external or system-level interactions. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or harmful payloads. The only possible concern is if input data is maliciously crafted to cause computational issues, but this does not constitute malicious code per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of economic curve modeling with validation, calculation, and scenario simulation features. No evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware was detected. It functions as intended for economic analysis, with no security risks or malicious behaviors present.",
