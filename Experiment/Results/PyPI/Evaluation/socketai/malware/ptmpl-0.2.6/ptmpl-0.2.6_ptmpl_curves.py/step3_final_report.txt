{
  "purpose": "The code models economic supply and demand curves, providing classes for curve representation, equilibrium calculation, and shock scenarios, primarily for analytical purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from constructor parameters containing price and supply/demand values; no external data sources or input streams are used.",
  "sinks": "All data remains in-memory; no external data exfiltration, network activity, or file I/O is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures into numpy arrays within class constructors; computations are internal and do not involve external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. Input validation enforces data integrity but does not introduce anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of economic modeling with classes for supply/demand curves, equilibrium calculations, and shock scenarios. It performs input validation (zero prices, monotonicity), uses numpy for numerical operations, and applies simple transformations for shocks. No external system interactions or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate economic modeling library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting its benign and transparent nature.",
