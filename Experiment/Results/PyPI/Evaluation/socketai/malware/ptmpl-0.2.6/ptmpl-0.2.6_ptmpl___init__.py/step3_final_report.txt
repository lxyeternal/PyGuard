  "purpose": "This code serves as a package template description, providing documentation for a Python package scaffold.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code is purely a descriptive docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform any operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only static documentation with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward documentation with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable, descriptive string outlining a Python package template. It contains only comments and docstrings with no functions, classes, or data handling. No external interactions, data flows, or malicious patterns are present. The assessments across all reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the content. Given the absence of executable code or suspicious elements, there is no indication of security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless documentation serving as a package template. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
