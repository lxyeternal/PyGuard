  "purpose": "This code provides a template or skeleton for creating new Python packages, serving as a development scaffold.",
  "sources": "No data input or data reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, source to sink, within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a docstring describing the package purpose; there are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module-level docstring that documents the purpose of the package template. It does not include any executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. Since it is a boilerplate template, there are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The absence of code beyond the descriptive comment indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package template with no malicious behavior or security issues. It serves solely as documentation and structural scaffolding for package development.",
