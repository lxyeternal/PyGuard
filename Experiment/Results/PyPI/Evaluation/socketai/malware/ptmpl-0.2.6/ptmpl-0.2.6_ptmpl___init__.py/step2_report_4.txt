  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues**  \n   All reports describe the code as solely a descriptive docstring or comment outlining a package template. There are no functions, classes, executable statements, data handling, or external interactions.  \n   **Conclusion:** The code is purely documentation with no operational logic, data flow, or code that could be malicious. No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: they correctly identify the code as non-executable, purely descriptive, and harmless. No logical flaws or errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, as there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, as no malicious activity is indicated.  \n   - **Security risk (0):** Correct, given the absence of executable code or data handling.  \n   The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since the code is only documentation with no executable or data processing components, the risk scores should remain at 0. No logic or behavior justifies higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the lack of any malicious indicators.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All reports are cautious and accurate, avoiding unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the content described. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is purely a descriptive comment, serving as a package template with no executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs. It presents no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
