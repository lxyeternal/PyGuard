  "purpose": "This module provides fixtures for pytest tests, loading supply and demand curve data from a JSON file for use in tests.",
  "sources": "Reads from the file 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' using the open() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input are present; file data is read locally.",
  "flows": "load_test_data() reads the JSON file and returns specific data; fixtures instantiate SupplyCurve and DemandCurve with this data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The JSON filename appears to be standard for tests.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local JSON file to load test data. It defines pytest fixtures that utilize this data to instantiate supply and demand curve objects. The data source is static, local, and not influenced by external untrusted input. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test setup code with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs simple data loading and object instantiation for testing purposes.",
