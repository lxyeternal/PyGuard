{
  "purpose": "This module provides test fixtures for pytest to load supply and demand curve data from a JSON file for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the file 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json'.",
  "sinks": "Data is passed directly to SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "The JSON file content flows into load_test_data(), then into supply_curve() and demand_curve() fixtures, which instantiate classes with this data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a JSON file to load test data, and creates pytest fixtures that instantiate classes with this data. No untrusted input is processed in a way that could lead to security issues. The file path is hardcoded, but it appears to be a local test data file, not user input or external data. The data flow is straightforward and confined to testing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test fixture setup for pytest with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely loads local JSON test data and provides fixtures for testing, which is safe.",
