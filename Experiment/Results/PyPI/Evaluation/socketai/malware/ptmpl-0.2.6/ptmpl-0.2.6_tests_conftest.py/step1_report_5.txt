{
  "purpose": "The module provides test fixtures for pytest to load and supply supply and demand curve objects for unit testing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' to load JSON test data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network, database, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the JSON file into the load_test_data() function, then into SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors in the fixtures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard Python practices, and loads static test data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a JSON test data file, and provides pytest fixtures that instantiate curve objects with the loaded data. No user input, environment variables, or external commands are involved. The JSON file path is hardcoded but is part of the test data directory, typical in testing environments. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. It loads static test data and provides fixtures for testing; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
