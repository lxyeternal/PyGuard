  "purpose": "Provides test fixtures for pytest to load supply and demand curve data from a JSON file for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data is used in a potentially harmful way; the JSON data is loaded and passed to class constructors without further processing.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON file -> Parses JSON -> Returns data to fixtures -> SupplyCurve/DemandCurve instantiated with data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a JSON file containing test data, parses it, and provides fixtures that instantiate supply and demand curve objects with this data. The file path is hardcoded but static, typical for test fixtures. There are no unsafe or malicious operations, no obfuscated code, no external network connections, or suspicious data handling. The code appears standard and straightforward for test setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test fixture setup for pytest, loading JSON test data for supply and demand curves. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
