{
  "purpose": "This module provides test fixtures for pytest, loading supply and demand curve data from a JSON file for use in tests.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a JSON file at 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json'.",
  "sinks": "The loaded JSON data is used to instantiate SupplyCurve and DemandCurve objects; no untrusted data flows directly to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the JSON file to parsing it with json.loads(), then to the constructors of SupplyCurve and DemandCurve.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules, loads a JSON file containing test data, and uses this data to create curve objects via fixtures. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is evident. The file reading is straightforward, and the data is only used for testing purposes. No external network calls, environment variable misuse, or sensitive data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test setup module without malicious intent or security risks. It reads test data from a local JSON file and provides fixtures for pytest. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
