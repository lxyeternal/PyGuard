  "purpose": "Load supply and demand curve data from a local JSON file for use in pytest fixtures.",
  "sources": "Reading 'tests/test_data/supply_demand_data.json' file, loading JSON content.",
  "sinks": "Passing loaded data into SupplyCurve and DemandCurve constructors.",
  "flows": "File read -> json.loads() -> supply_demand data -> fixture functions -> object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with static local file usage. Minor docstring inconsistency in load_test_data() regarding return type.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local JSON file containing supply and demand data, then uses this data to instantiate curve objects via pytest fixtures. No user input, network activity, or dynamic data sources are involved. The data is static and local, used solely for testing. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are present. The JSON filename is hardcoded but typical for test fixtures. The code is simple, with no suspicious patterns. The docstring in load_test_data() claims to return a Dict but actually returns a List, which is a minor inconsistency but not security-relevant. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test setup that loads static JSON data for unit testing. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are present. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should be 0, with high confidence, reflecting the code's simplicity and safety.",
