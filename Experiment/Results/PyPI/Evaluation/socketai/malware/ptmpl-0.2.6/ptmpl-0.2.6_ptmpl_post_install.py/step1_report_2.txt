{
  "purpose": "Automates post-installation tasks by downloading and executing a remote script, and installing packages.",
  "sources": "Reading from a URL ('https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh'), reading from environment variables for the user's home directory.",
  "sinks": "Writing to the local filesystem at the user's home directory, executing shell commands ('apt update && apt install tmux -y'), running a downloaded script with subprocess.",
  "flows": "Download script from URL -> Save to local file -> Change permissions -> Execute shell commands -> Run downloaded script with parameters",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing a script directly from a URL, which can be malicious; no validation or checksum verification for the script; executing shell commands without sanitization; running a remote script with parameters that could be manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads a script from a remote URL and executes it locally without any integrity checks, which poses a significant security risk. It also executes system commands ('apt update' and package installation) and runs the downloaded script with specific arguments. The script URL is hardcoded, and the code does not validate the script content or its origin. These behaviors can be exploited to run malicious code or perform unauthorized actions on the system. The direct execution of downloaded code and system commands is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high risk due to downloading and executing remote scripts without verification, and executing system commands that can alter system state or install potentially malicious software. It has characteristics typical of supply chain attacks or malicious post-install scripts.",
