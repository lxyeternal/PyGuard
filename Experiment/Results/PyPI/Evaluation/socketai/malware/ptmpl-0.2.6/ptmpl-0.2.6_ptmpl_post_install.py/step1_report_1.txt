{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to download and execute a remote shell script, then perform system package updates and install a package (tmux).",
  "sources": "The code reads from the internet via requests.get() to download the script, and reads the script from disk when executing it.",
  "sinks": "The code executes system commands using os.system() and subprocess.run(), which can run arbitrary commands including the downloaded script.",
  "flows": "Download script from URL -> Save to local path -> Change permissions -> Execute script via subprocess; Also run system commands for system update and package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes a script from an external URL without validation or verification, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It also runs system commands that could alter system state maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically downloads a shell script from an external source and executes it without any validation, which could allow remote malicious code execution. The script then performs system update and installs 'tmux', which may be legitimate but, in this context, is risky due to the untrusted external script. The use of os.system() and subprocess.run() to execute potentially malicious code is dangerous. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious or harmful automation, especially since the downloaded script is not verified.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes an external script without validation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It also executes system commands that could be used maliciously. Overall, this code poses a high security risk.",
