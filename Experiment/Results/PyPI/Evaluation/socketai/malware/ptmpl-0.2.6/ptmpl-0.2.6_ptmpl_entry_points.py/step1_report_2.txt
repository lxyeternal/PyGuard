  "purpose": "Provides entry point functions for installing a Python package template from GitHub via command-line interaction.",
  "sources": "argv[1] for user commands, input() for user confirmation, requests.get() for downloading ZIP, file I/O for saving and extracting ZIP, environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'temp.zip' file, extracting ZIP archive to current directory, deleting 'temp.zip'.",
  "flows": "User command (argv[1]) -> install_template_from_github() -> user confirmation -> requests.get() -> file write -> zip extraction -> remove('temp.zip')",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed. The download URL is fixed but benign in context; no suspicious domain patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a command-line argument and prompts the user for confirmation before downloading and extracting a ZIP archive from a fixed GitHub URL. The download and extraction are straightforward file operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, executing downloaded code, or connecting to suspicious domains. It uses standard libraries and a well-known URL. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flow identified. Overall, the code appears to perform a benign installation process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard installer script that downloads and extracts a GitHub repository ZIP archive after user confirmation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears safe with respect to supply chain security.",
