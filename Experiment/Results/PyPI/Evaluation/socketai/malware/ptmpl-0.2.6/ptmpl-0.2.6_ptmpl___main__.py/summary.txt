  "conclusion": "The code pattern presents a high security risk due to remote code execution without validation, especially with elevated privileges. The high malware and risk scores are justified. It should be redesigned to validate, sanitize, or sandbox downloaded scripts before execution to mitigate potential malicious activity."
