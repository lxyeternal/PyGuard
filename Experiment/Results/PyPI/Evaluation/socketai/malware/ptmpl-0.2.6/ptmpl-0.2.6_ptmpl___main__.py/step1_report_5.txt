  "purpose": "Download and execute scripts from a remote server, optionally with elevated privileges.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to the specified URL to retrieve script content.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing the downloaded script content directly in the shell.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data (script content) flows directly into subprocess execution, potentially as root.",
  "anomalies": "The script downloads external code and executes it directly without validation, which is risky. Usage of 'shell=True' with dynamic content and optional 'sudo' execution without checks is suspicious. No validation or sanitization of downloaded scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads scripts from a remote server based on user input, then executes the content directly via shell. It permits running scripts with root privileges. The use of 'shell=True' combined with executing unverified external content creates a high security risk, as malicious code could be run unintentionally or deliberately. The code lacks any validation, signature verification, or sandboxing. The URL is hardcoded, but that alone is not suspicious; however, executing downloaded scripts without checks is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high security risk due to downloading and executing remote scripts directly, especially with root privileges, without validation. This behavior can be exploited for malicious purposes. No malware indicators are explicitly present, but the dangerous pattern of dynamic code execution constitutes a severe security concern.",
