{
  "purpose": "Download and execute scripts from a remote URL based on user input, with optional root privileges.",
  "sources": "User input via command line arguments ('--scripts') and script download URL ('BASE_URL').",
  "sinks": "Execution of downloaded scripts via subprocess.run with shell=True, potentially executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "User provides script names -> download_script fetches content from remote URL -> run_script executes the content via shell command.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'shell=True' in subprocess without sanitization; executes remote code directly. Downloads scripts dynamically based on user input, which can be exploited to run malicious scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script takes command line arguments to specify script identifiers and names. It downloads scripts from a remote server and executes them directly via shell, with optional 'sudo' privileges. The use of 'shell=True' combined with executing downloaded content without validation introduces a high security risk. The code does not perform any validation or sandboxing, making it susceptible to remote code execution if the remote server is compromised or if user inputs are malicious. No obfuscation or encryption is present. Overall, the script facilitates remote code execution with significant security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code can execute arbitrary remote scripts with root privileges, representing a high security risk. It lacks input validation, sanitization, and safe execution practices, which makes it potentially malicious in intent or dangerous if exploited.",
