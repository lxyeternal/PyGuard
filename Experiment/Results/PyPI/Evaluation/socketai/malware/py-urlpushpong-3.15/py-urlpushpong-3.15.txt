      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package setup, with external URL references. This pattern is indicative of malicious behavior, such as remote control or data theft. The assigned high scores are justified, and the package should be treated as malicious or requiring further investigation."
