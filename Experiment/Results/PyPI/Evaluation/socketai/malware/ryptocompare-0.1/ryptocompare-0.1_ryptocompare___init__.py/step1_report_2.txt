  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly from external files or network requests, depending on specific functions invoked.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or file writes if untrusted data is passed without validation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env/file/network) to sinks (system commands, network transmissions, or file outputs), but specifics depend on runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or malicious obfuscation detected. Some dynamic code execution or eval usage, if present, could be suspicious, but details are missing or minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain evident malicious logic such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or data theft. Usage of third-party libraries is typical. Without explicit network or system command calls, there is no strong evidence of malicious behavior. No obfuscation or encryption appears present. The structure is straightforward, with standard patterns. If code includes eval or exec with untrusted data, that would be suspicious, but such details are not provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears standard, with no suspicious patterns or security risks identified. Confidence is high that the code is benign, but limited information reduces certainty about unseen runtime behaviors.",
