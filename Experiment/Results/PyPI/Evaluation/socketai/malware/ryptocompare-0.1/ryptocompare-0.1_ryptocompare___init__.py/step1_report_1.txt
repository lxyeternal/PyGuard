  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and function parameters, and potentially from imported modules that may access files or network.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data leaks via print or logs, depending on code behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables into internal functions, possibly leading to network transmission or file system modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. Some use of dynamic evaluation or reflection should be checked carefully, but none are evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, with typical input handling and processing logic. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious data flow are evident. The code does not contain suspicious network connections, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure is clear, and no anomalous or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated malware. The code appears to be safe and benign.",
