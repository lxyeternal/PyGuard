  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, file I/O, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to logs, files, or network connections; possibly uses eval or exec statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment, files) through processing functions, potentially reaching output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval() or exec() calls, hardcoded credentials or tokens, unusual obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure includes multiple import statements, some use of dynamic code execution functions, and potential hardcoded strings. There are no clear indications of malicious payloads like system destruction commands or network exfiltration in the visible snippets. However, usage of eval(), exec(), or similar functions, especially with untrusted input, poses security concerns. Hardcoded secrets or credentials, if present, also raise alarms. The overall logic is straightforward but warrants caution if dynamic code execution is involved.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, there are some potential security risks due to dynamic code execution functions and hardcoded secrets. There is no definitive evidence of malicious activity, but the presence of such patterns suggests a need for closer inspection before use in sensitive environments.",
