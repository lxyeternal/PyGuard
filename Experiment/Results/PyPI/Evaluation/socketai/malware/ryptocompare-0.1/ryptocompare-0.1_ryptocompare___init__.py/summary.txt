  "conclusion": "The code shows some risky patterns, notably dynamic execution and secrets, warranting cautious review. Scores are appropriately assigned, with slight adjustments to reflect the potential for misuse. No active malware or malicious payloads are confirmed, but the presence of eval/exec and secrets justifies a moderate security concern."
