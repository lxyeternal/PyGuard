  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic code execution points ('eval', 'exec'), hardcoded secrets, complex constructs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file I/O, system commands, data leaks, logging.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious payload execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'eval'/'exec' with untrusted data, complex or obfuscated code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution without clear sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical data processing patterns with some instances of dynamic code execution ('eval', 'exec') and complex constructs. While no explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, the use of eval/exec with untrusted input and hardcoded secrets pose moderate security risks. The obfuscation levels are minimal, primarily complex constructs rather than true obfuscation. The overall security risk is moderate, justified by potential misuse of dynamic execution points. The malware score is set at 0.2 to reflect the potential danger without confirmed malicious activity. The obfuscation score remains low unless evidence of obfuscation is present. Confidence levels are moderate, acknowledging the suspicion but lack of concrete malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows some risky patterns, notably dynamic execution and secrets, warranting cautious review. Scores are appropriately assigned, with slight adjustments to reflect the potential for misuse. No active malware or malicious payloads are confirmed, but the presence of eval/exec and secrets justifies a moderate security concern.",
