      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, with heavy obfuscation, system modifications, privilege escalation, and package manipulation. It should be classified as highly malicious and dangerous, suitable for malicious supply chain attack payloads. It must not be executed or deployed. Further forensic analysis is recommended if encountered."

Scores are appropriately assigned, with slight adjustments to reflect the potential for misuse. No active malware or malicious payloads are confirmed, but the presence of eval/exec and secrets justifies a moderate security concern."
