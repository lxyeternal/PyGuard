    "The 'run' method of the custom 'install' class, which is executed during package installation.",
    "Imports within the 'run' method: os, requests, fernet, and the exec() call with decrypted data."

    "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes.",
    "Checks if os.name == 'nt' (Windows).",
    "If true, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and executes embedded code via exec()."

  "anomalies": [
    "Presence of encrypted string and decryption key within the code, executed via exec().",
    "Decrypted code is executed dynamically, which is suspicious.",
    "Use of 'exec()' with decrypted payload introduces risk of executing malicious code.",
    "Obfuscated and non-descriptive variable/function names.",
    "Long, nonsensical description and long description strings, likely placeholder or obfuscation."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script with a custom 'install' command that, upon execution on Windows, decrypts and runs code dynamically via 'exec()'. The decryption uses a hardcoded key and ciphertext, and the decrypted code is executed directly, which is highly suspicious. This pattern is typical of malicious code intended to hide payloads and execute arbitrary commands at install time. The inclusion of 'requests' and 'fernet' suggests potential network activity or further malicious behavior post-install. The code's obfuscation, encrypted payload, and runtime execution point toward malicious intent. While this could be a legitimate backdoor, the pattern matches common malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior through dynamic code execution of encrypted payload during installation on Windows. It leverages obfuscation and runtime decryption to hide its true intent, posing a high security risk. Therefore, this package should be considered unsafe and avoided.",
