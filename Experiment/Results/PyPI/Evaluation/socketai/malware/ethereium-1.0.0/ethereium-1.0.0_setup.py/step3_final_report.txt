{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts a payload with a hardcoded Fernet key during Windows installation and executes it via exec(), indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload string and the hardcoded Fernet key within the run() method, triggered during install on Windows.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing decrypted code, which can run arbitrary malicious commands or payloads.",
  "flows": "The code decrypts the payload using Fernet with the hardcoded key, then passes the decrypted code directly to exec(), during the install process on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name, nonsensical long description strings, hardcoded cryptographic key, encrypted payload embedded in code, conditional execution only on Windows.",
  "analysis": "The setup script contains a class that overrides run(), which, on Windows, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload with a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it via exec(). The obfuscated class name and nonsensical description strings suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The presence of decrypt-and-execute pattern during package installation is a classic indicator of malicious supply chain behavior. The code does not perform any legitimate setup functions beyond this activity. The encrypted payload is not reviewable, further raising suspicion. The high confidence scores (near 1) are justified due to the clear malicious pattern, active code execution, and obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows. The pattern, obfuscation, and embedded encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent, constituting a severe security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend flagging this package as malicious and unsafe for installation.",
