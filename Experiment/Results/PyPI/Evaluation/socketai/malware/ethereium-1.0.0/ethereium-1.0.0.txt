      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during package installation on Windows. The pattern, obfuscation, and embedded encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent, constituting a severe security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend flagging this package as malicious and unsafe for installation."
