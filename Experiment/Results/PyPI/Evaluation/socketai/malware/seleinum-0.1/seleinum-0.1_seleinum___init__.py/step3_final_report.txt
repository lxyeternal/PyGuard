  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, external API calls, file/network I/O, and code snippets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network transmission, file writes, environment variable access, or logs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions, API calls, or data transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, placeholder snippets, or incomplete code; high confidence in no malicious activity due to lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or minimal presence of code, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious API calls. The malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the lack of malicious indicators. Risk scores are mostly low (0.2), reflecting cautious but minimal concern given limited code context. Confidence levels are appropriate; however, for reports with no code (Reports 1 and 3), high confidence is justified, but for minimal code reports (Reports 2, 4, 5), slightly lower confidence (around 0.3-0.4) would be more accurate. The scores for obfuscation are appropriate at zero. Minor adjustments to risk scores could better reflect the evidence, setting them closer to zero where no suspicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks in the analyzed code snippets. The current scores are justified and appropriate, with slight room for lowering risk scores in minimal or no-code reports to reflect the absence of suspicious behavior.",
