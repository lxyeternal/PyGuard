  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be an import or setup script, possibly for a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and possibly from environment variables or configuration files, if present.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules or environment/config sources, but no malicious flow such as network transmission or file manipulation is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty or missing; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment contains no executable statements, functions, or data flows. There are no sources of input, no sinks, and no flows. The absence of code makes it impossible to identify malicious behavior or security issues. Given this, the code appears to be either a placeholder or an incomplete snippet. No anomalies or malicious intent are detectable from the given fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of content, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code does not contain any suspicious elements or activity. The security risk is minimal due to the absence of executable code.",
