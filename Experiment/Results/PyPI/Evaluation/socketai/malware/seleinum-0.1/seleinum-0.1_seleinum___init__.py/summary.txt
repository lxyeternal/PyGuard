  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks in the analyzed code snippets. The current scores are justified and appropriate, with slight room for lowering risk scores in minimal or no-code reports to reflect the absence of suspicious behavior."
