  "flows": "No data flow paths exist within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The class is empty, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an empty class definition named 'send' with no methods, attributes, or behavior. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows. The absence of functionality means no malicious activity or security risks are present. The code appears to be a stub or placeholder. There is no indication of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, empty class definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any operations, communicate externally, or handle data in any way. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
