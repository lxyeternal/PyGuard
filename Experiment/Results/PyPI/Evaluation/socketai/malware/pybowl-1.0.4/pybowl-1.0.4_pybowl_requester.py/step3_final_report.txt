  "purpose": "This code defines an empty class named 'send' with no methods or attributes, serving as a placeholder or stub.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the class contains no logic, data handling, or external interactions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, no data leaks, no external outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; the class is inert with no source-to-sink pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of methods, attributes, or logic; trivial class with no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, empty class with no behavior, input/output, or external interactions. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and lack of activity indicate it is a benign placeholder. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with full confidence (1), which is appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving as a placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are consistent and accurate, requiring no modifications.",
