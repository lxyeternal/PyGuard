  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The class is defined but contains no implementation; no suspicious or unusual code behavior or secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class declaration with no methods, attributes, or logic. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no indications of malicious intent. The simplicity suggests it is a placeholder or an incomplete stub. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The absence of code execution, data handling, or external interactions indicates no malicious or security-related concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, containing only an empty class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a placeholder with no functional or security implications.",
