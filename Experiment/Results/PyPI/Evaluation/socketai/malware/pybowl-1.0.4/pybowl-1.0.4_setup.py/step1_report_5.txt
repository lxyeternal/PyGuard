  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup script, including a custom install command that executes embedded encoded code during installation.",
  "sources": [
    "The import statements for 'setuptools' and 'setuptools.command.install'.",
    "The 'run' method of the 'CustomInstallCommand' class, which imports 'base64'.",
    "The embedded base64-encoded string within the 'exec' call inside the 'try' block.",
    "The 'setup()' function with package metadata and configuration."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "The 'exec' call that executes decoded base64 code, which appears to dynamically import modules and run code.",
    "Potential network calls or system modifications if the decoded code performs such actions."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Source: The 'exec' decoding the base64 string.",
    "Destination: The executed code within the 'try' block, which likely performs malicious or suspicious operations."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Embedded base64-encoded code executed during installation, which is suspicious and can hide malicious payloads.",
    "The code decodes and executes obfuscated code, indicating an attempt to conceal behavior.",
    "Presence of complex, long, encoded string that is not typical for standard setup scripts.",
    "The decoded code imports 'os', 'subprocess', and other modules, then runs potentially dangerous commands involving network access and executing scripts from remote URLs.",
    "Use of 'exec' with decoded code is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'pybowl'. It defines a custom install command that, upon execution, imports 'base64' and attempts to decode and execute an embedded base64 string. This string, when decoded, appears to import modules like 'os' and 'subprocess' and then run commands that involve network access, remote script execution, or other potentially malicious activities. The obfuscated nature of the payload, executed during package installation, is highly suspicious. Such behavior is commonly associated with supply chain attacks, where malicious code is embedded into legitimate package setup scripts to execute upon installation. Overall, the code demonstrates a high likelihood of malicious intent, hidden behind standard setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious obfuscated payload executed during package installation, likely intended for malicious activities such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The use of 'exec' with a decoded string indicates an attempt to conceal malicious operations. This package should be considered dangerous and unsafe to use.",
