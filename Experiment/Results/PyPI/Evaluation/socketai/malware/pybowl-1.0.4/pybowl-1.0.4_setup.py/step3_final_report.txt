{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform package setup and installation, but during this process, it executes a base64-encoded payload via exec(), which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the embedded base64 string decoded during the run() method of CustomInstallCommand.",
  "sinks": "The decoded payload, once executed, can perform network requests, system commands, or data exfiltration, leading to potential system compromise or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the base64 string and passes it directly to exec(), creating a source-to-sink flow that executes arbitrary code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a long base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec() during setup is highly unusual and suspicious. The payload appears obfuscated intentionally to conceal malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, during execution, attempts to decode a base64 string and run it with exec(). The payload, once decoded, imports modules and performs network activity, suggesting malicious behavior such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The obfuscation via base64 and dynamic execution is a common tactic in malicious packages. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware=1, obfuscated=1, securityRisk=1) are justified by the evidence. The code's behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns, and the execution during setup increases the risk of system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains heavily obfuscated malicious payloads executed during package installation, representing a high security threat. All evidence points to malicious intent, and the package should be considered dangerous and untrustworthy.",
