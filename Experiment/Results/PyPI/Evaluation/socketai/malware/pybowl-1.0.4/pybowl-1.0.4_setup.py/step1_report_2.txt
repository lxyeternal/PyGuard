{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pybowl' Python package with a custom install command that executes embedded code.",
  "sources": "The code reads from hardcoded string data within the custom install command, particularly base64-decoded code executed via exec.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code via exec, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution during package installation.",
  "flows": "The setup script imports setuptools, then during installation, the custom run method decodes base64 string, executes it, and proceeds with standard installation.",
  "anomalies": "The run method contains base64-encoded code that, when decoded, performs dynamic code execution using exec, which is unusual and suspicious in a package setup. The decoded code appears to import modules, check environment, and perform network operations, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install command. The custom run method includes a try-except block that executes base64-decoded code using exec. The decoded code is obfuscated and performs network activity, potentially exfiltrating data or connecting to malicious domains. The code appears to dynamically execute code during package installation, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The rest of the setup code is standard, but the embedded code execution constitutes a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code embedded in the install process that executes during installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The presence of obfuscated code and network activity strongly indicates malicious behavior. The package should be considered dangerous and unsafe to use.",
