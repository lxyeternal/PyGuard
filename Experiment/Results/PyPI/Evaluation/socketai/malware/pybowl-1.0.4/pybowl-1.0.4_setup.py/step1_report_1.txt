  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pybowl' Python package, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from base64-encoded strings during the custom install process; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded base64 content via exec(), which executes arbitrary code embedded in the encoded string.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded and executed during installation, which could run malicious code if the encoded payload is harmful.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded base64 content is highly unusual and suspicious; it indicates potential malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a custom install command that attempts to run an obfuscated base64-encoded payload via exec(). This payload, once decoded, appears to perform malicious or suspicious network activity, including calling functions that create and run subprocesses with commands that seem to involve potentially malicious URLs or actions. The code uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding, exec) that are common in malicious scripts to hide malicious intent. The setup() function configures package metadata and assigns the custom install command, which triggers the malicious code during installation. Overall, the code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious payload execution during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious base64-encoded payload executed via exec() during installation, indicating malicious intent or sabotage. The obfuscation and execution method strongly suggest malicious behavior designed to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code at install time.",
