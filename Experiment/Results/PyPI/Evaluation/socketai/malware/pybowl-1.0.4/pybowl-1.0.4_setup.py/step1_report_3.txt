{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'pybowl' with a custom install command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from base64-encoded strings within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method, especially during the execution of exec(base64.b64decode(...)).",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes code decoded from base64, which could run arbitrary code if the payload is malicious. The code also imports modules and sets up package installation but does not directly perform data leaks or network connections.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code decodes the base64 string and executes it via exec(), which is a source-to-sink flow where untrusted payload could be executed. The rest of the script involves standard setup procedures.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code executed via exec() during the custom install process, which is suspicious. The base64 string, when decoded, appears to contain code that performs network requests, potentially to remote servers, and may include backdoors or data exfiltration. The use of try-except with a silent pass suppresses error reporting, hiding potential issues. The code structure suggests an attempt to embed malicious behavior into the installation process.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup.py configuration with a custom install command that, upon running, attempts to decode and execute obfuscated Python code embedded as a base64 string. This obfuscated code, when decoded, appears to perform HTTP requests to specific URLs, possibly sending system or user data without user consent. The code's purpose is hidden through obfuscation, making it a high risk for malicious activity. The rest of the setup code is standard and benign, but the embedded code execution during installation is a critical security concern. The code's structure and use of base64-encoded, dynamically executed code indicate malicious intent or a backdoor mechanism, classifying this as high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated malicious code executed during installation, likely used for backdoor access or data exfiltration. The presence of exec() with decoded payloads is a significant security risk, indicating intentional malicious behavior. It is strongly advised not to use this package.",
