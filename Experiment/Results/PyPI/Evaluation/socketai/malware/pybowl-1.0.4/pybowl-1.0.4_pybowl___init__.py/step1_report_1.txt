  "purpose": "Constructor method for a class, currently does nothing.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is being output or transferred.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the method is empty and has no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Empty constructor method; no operational code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __init__ method, typical in Python classes, but the method is empty with just a pass statement. There are no input sources, data processing, or data sinks. It appears to be a placeholder or boilerplate code with no malicious intent, behavior, or security risks evident. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign constructor method with no operational logic, malicious behavior, or security concerns.",
