  "purpose": "Constructor method (__init__) with no implementation, possibly for a class.",

  "flows": "No data flows present; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "The method is defined but contains no code, which is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __init__ method with no implementation. It does not perform any operations, access external data, or contain any code that could be malicious. The empty method suggests an incomplete class or placeholder. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a trivial, benign code fragment defining an empty constructor. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
