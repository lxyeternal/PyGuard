  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package installation. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and error suppression indicates malicious intent. The high scores assigned are justified, and this package should be flagged as suspicious or malicious. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its exact behavior."
