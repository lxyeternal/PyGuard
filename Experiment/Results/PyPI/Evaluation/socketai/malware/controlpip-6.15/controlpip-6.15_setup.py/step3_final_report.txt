  "purpose": "Detects malicious remote code execution embedded in the setup script via obfuscated PowerShell command during package installation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess.Popen executing encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of obfuscated PowerShell command that connects to remote server and loads external code.",
  "flows": "Directory existence check → conditional remote code fetch and execution during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently; error suppression with try-except blocks; code runs during package setup, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a filesystem check and, if the 'tahg' directory is absent, executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess with hidden window flags. The encoded command, when decoded, connects to 'dl.dragobx.com' and loads remote resources, indicating malicious intent. The silent error handling can conceal failures. The obfuscation and remote connection during setup are typical of malware or backdoors. All reports correctly identify these behaviors, assigning high malware (0.8-0.9), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk scores (~0.75-0.85). The evidence justifies these high scores, as the code exhibits remote code execution, obfuscation, and potential supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated remote code execution payload executed during package setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. The package should be flagged as malicious or at least highly suspicious pending further payload analysis.",
