  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command during setup, with suspicious comments and error suppression. Scores of malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9) are justified. The package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious pending further decoding of the payload."
