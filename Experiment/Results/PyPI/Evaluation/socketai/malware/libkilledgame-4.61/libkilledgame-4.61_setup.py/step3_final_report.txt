{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'libkilledgame' but contains a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup, which raises suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of a base64-encoded PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call that runs the encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, potentially executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' -> if not exists -> execute obfuscated PowerShell command silently -> proceed with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an encoded, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently; suppression of errors via try-except blocks; embedded URL comment indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check and, if the directory 'tahg' is absent, runs an obfuscated PowerShell command with hidden window flags, likely to conceal malicious activity. The command is encoded, making analysis difficult, and errors are suppressed, which could hide failures or malicious actions. The rest of the setup code appears benign. The obfuscation, silent execution, and context strongly suggest malicious intent, such as payload download or persistence mechanisms. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0.75-0.8, obfuscated: 0.75-0.9, security risk: 0.75-0.8) are justified given these indicators. Decoding the command could provide further clarity, but current evidence indicates high suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed covertly during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The behavior warrants caution, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further analysis confirms its purpose.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
