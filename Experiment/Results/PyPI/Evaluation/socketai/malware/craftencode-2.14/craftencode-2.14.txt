      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the obfuscated, conditional execution of a hidden PowerShell command during setup, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoors. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified. It should be treated as malicious until further decoding confirms the payload's intent."
