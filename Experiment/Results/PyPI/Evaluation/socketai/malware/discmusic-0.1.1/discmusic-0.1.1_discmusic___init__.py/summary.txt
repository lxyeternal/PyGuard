  "conclusion": "The code exhibits definitive malicious behavior: remote download and execution without validation. All reports correctly identify this pattern. To reflect the severity accurately, the malware score should be set to 1.0, and the overall security risk should also be 1.0, indicating high danger. The code is not obfuscated, and the behavior warrants a maximum threat level."
