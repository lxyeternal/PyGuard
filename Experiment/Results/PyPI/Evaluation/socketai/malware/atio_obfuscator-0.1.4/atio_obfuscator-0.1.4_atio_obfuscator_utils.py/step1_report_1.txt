{
  "purpose": "This script appears to collect sensitive user information from various browsers, Discord tokens, and files, then exfiltrate the data via Discord webhooks and file uploads. It also gathers system information, IP addresses, and potentially exploits browser data for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, browser storage files, local database files (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord data, and user files from Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. Reads network requests, logs, and cookies from multiple locations.",
  "sinks": "Uploads collected tokens, cookies, passwords, files, and system info to external servers via webhooks and file upload services. Executes system commands to terminate processes and manipulate files. Potentially executes external commands or scripts via subprocess.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser storage, logs, and database files are read and parsed for tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. Extracted data is stored in variables or written to files. Data is then uploaded via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and file hosting services, completing the source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded webhook URL, which is suspicious. The code automatically installs dependencies without user consent. Uses process-killing commands to terminate processes like browsers and Steam. Extensive use of threading for data collection. No clear user consent or transparency, suggesting malicious intent. Randomly generates filenames and directories. Comments and code style indicate obfuscation or deliberate concealment. The code gathers a wide array of personal info, including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, then exfiltrates all data automatically.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed for malicious data theft. It collects tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from various browsers and applications. It decrypts stored data using Windows APIs and system cryptography functions. It also retrieves system info such as IP address and geolocation. The data is formatted into Discord embed messages or files, then uploaded or sent via webhooks. The code kills processes like browsers and Steam to prevent user interference during operation. It also searches for specific file types and keywords indicative of sensitive data. Extensive use of threading improves operational speed, which is typical for malicious tools aiming for rapid exfiltration. The hardcoded webhook URL and automated dependency installation are strong indicators of malicious activity. Overall, the script performs comprehensive user data harvesting, system manipulation, and exfiltration without user consent or notification.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, designed for extensive data theft, system manipulation, and exfiltration. It operates stealthily by hiding its activities and terminating security-related processes. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, automated dependency installs, and broad data collection strongly indicate malicious intent. It should not be trusted or used under any circumstances.",
