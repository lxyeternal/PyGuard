{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to extract sensitive user information from browsers, Discord, and other applications, including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, then upload or send this data to a remote webhook or server. It also gathers system info, geolocation, and zip files from specified paths for malicious collection and exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Input sources include: browser profile directories (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord directories, Steam, NationsGlory, Riot Client, Telegram directories, and local database files containing login data, cookies, and tokens. It reads local storage files, logs, databases, and user files in specified directories.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points include: sending data via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook, or to an external server through requests and URL open calls, uploading files to gofile.io, and creating zip archives for exfiltration. Functions like 'uploadToken', 'upload', and 'GatherZips' send collected data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from: browser login and cookie databases, token extraction from local logs and memory, user info via API calls, geolocation, and Discord data, through parsing and decryption routines, to functions that upload or send data to external URLs or services. The data flow involves decrypting cookies/tokens, collecting user info, and exfiltrating via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes hardcoded webhook URL, repeated attempts to install modules without validation, extensive use of threading for concurrent file collection, and obfuscation-like variable names (e.g., 'da', 'a', 'rrr', 'rb'). It kills processes to access files, copies database files for decryption, and uploads potentially sensitive user data. Functions like 'Trust' flag suspicious cookie domains, and the code uses indirect methods to access tokens and passwords, indicating an intent to evade detection. The code also includes extensive file and directory scanning for passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data, along with packaging and uploading these files.",
  "analysis": "The script is highly suspicious and malicious in intent. It collects user data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, Discord tokens, and other credentials, then exfiltrates via webhooks and file uploads. It decrypts stored data with Windows cryptography functions, indicates knowledge of browser storage formats, and employs threading to quickly gather data from multiple sources. It also kills processes to access locked files, suggests obfuscation tactics, and attempts to bypass security checks. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL, extensive data harvesting routines, and process termination strongly indicate malicious behavior aimed at stealthy credential theft and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to steal sensitive user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files from browsers, Discord, and other applications, then exfiltrate this information to an external server or webhook. It employs various techniques such as process termination, decryption of stored data, multi-threaded collection, and file packaging to maximize data theft while evading detection. The purpose is consistent with a credential stealer or information logger malware.",
