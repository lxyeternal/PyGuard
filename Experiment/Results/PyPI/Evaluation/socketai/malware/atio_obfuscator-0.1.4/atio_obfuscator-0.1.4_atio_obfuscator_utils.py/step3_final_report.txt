{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform extensive data theft, including extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and system information from browsers, Discord, Telegram, and other applications, then exfiltrating this data via a hardcoded Discord webhook and anonymous file hosting services. It also kills security-related processes to prevent user interference and installs dependencies silently, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, browser storage files, local databases, logs, local state files, user directories, and application data files.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration via hardcoded Discord webhook, uploads to anonymous hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh), and creation of zip archives for stolen data.",
  "flows": "Data is read from sources (browser files, logs, local state, directories), decrypted if necessary, then sent through HTTP requests (webhook, file uploads), often after being processed or compressed, with process termination and threading used to maximize stealth and efficiency.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, silent installation of dependencies, process termination commands, broad and automated data collection, indirect regex patterns for token extraction, obfuscation tactics in variable naming, and multi-threaded operations for speed.",
  "analysis": "The script exhibits all hallmarks of a sophisticated info-stealer malware: it decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs and AES, extracts tokens with regex, collects passwords and cookies from browsers, searches for sensitive files based on keywords, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads. It employs threading for efficiency, kills processes to prevent user interference, and installs dependencies silently. The code's structure and behaviors align with known malicious data theft tools, with some obfuscation present but not extreme. The hardcoded webhook and process-killing routines further indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer malware, capable of extracting sensitive user information from multiple sources, decrypting stored credentials, and exfiltrating data stealthily. Its behaviors are consistent with advanced info-stealers, and the overall security risk is extremely high.",
