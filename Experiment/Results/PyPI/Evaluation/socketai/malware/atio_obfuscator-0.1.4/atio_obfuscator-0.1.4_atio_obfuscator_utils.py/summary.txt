  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer malware, capable of extracting sensitive user information from multiple sources, decrypting stored credentials, and exfiltrating data stealthily. Its behaviors are consistent with advanced info-stealers, and the overall security risk is extremely high."
