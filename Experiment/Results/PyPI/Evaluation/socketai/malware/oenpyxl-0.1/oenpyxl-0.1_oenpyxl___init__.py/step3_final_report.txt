  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include code snippets, configuration files, or descriptions indicating data flow or behavior patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, or execution points where untrusted data could cause harm or information disclosure.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources to sinks, including any dynamic code execution, network communication, or file modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "All reports acknowledge the absence of actual code, with scores reflecting no suspicious activity. The scores are consistent with the lack of evidence, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero. Confidence levels vary but tend to be slightly optimistic given no code is present; adjusting confidence downward slightly would improve accuracy. The reasoning is cautious and appropriate, with no false positives or contradictions. Overall, the assessments are reasonable and align with the available information.",
  "conclusion": "The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and suspicious patterns, assigning low risk and malware scores. Confidence scores could be moderated to better reflect the lack of concrete evidence. No significant adjustments are necessary; the evaluations are consistent and appropriate.",
