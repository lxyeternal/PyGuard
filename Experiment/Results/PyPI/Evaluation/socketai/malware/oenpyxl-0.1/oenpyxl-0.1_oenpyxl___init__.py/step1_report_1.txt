  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without the actual code content, the specific intent cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, reading environment variables, or data files, but no code provided to identify exact sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network transmissions, file writes, or command executions, but no explicit code provided to specify.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be identified without actual code; normally would track data pathways from input to output or side-effects.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided to evaluate for anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code context provided for detailed analysis. Cannot determine data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors without actual code content. Cannot identify any anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review; therefore, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified at this time. Further analysis requires the actual code snippet.",
