  "purpose": "Terminal styling utility for applying ANSI color and style codes with platform-specific support.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), platform detection, system calls for Windows console configuration.",
  "sinks": "ANSI escape code generation for styling; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence enabled() checks; platform detection triggers Windows API calls; style functions generate ANSI codes based on input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward handling of environment variables and platform-specific API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code provides terminal styling functions with environment variable checks for color support, platform detection for Windows console configuration via ctypes, and ANSI code generation. It does not include network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The Windows API calls are standard for enabling virtual terminal processing. No obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The environment variable handling is typical for controlling color output. Overall, the code is a benign utility for terminal styling with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured terminal styling utility with platform-specific support. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
