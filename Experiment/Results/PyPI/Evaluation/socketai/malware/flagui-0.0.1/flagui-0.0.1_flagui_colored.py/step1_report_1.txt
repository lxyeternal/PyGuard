{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for styling terminal output with colors and text styles, including platform-specific terminal mode adjustments.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), checks if stdout/stderr are TTYs, and imports modules like os, sys, platform, and ctypes.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables to control behavior; calls platform-specific Windows API functions for terminal mode; constructs ANSI escape sequences for styling terminal output.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence enabled() behavior; platform check leads to calling Windows API functions; style functions generate ANSI codes that are returned for styling text output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code primarily deals with styling output and enabling terminal modes. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes terminal styling and color functions, including platform-specific terminal mode setup for Windows. It respects environment variables that control color support. No data input sources or untrusted data sinks related to sensitive data processing are present. The functions generate ANSI escape codes for styling, with no network or file I/O that could be malicious. Overall, the code is standard for terminal styling and does not include malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard terminal styling utility without any malicious intent or malicious behavior. It carefully handles platform differences and respects environment variables for color support. No malware or security risks are detected.",
