{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and classes for styling console output with colors and styles, including platform-specific Windows terminal mode support.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), checks if stdout/stderr are TTYs, uses platform.system() to detect OS, imports from internal modules (library, hexadecimal, utilities).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data sinks like network, file, or system commands are used.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence TTY awareness and color support; platform checks influence Windows terminal mode; internal methods handle color/style formatting based on internal libraries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious backdoors or obfuscated code; use of global variables (e.g., _win_vterm_mode) is controlled and standard for such platform checks; no data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with console styling, platform-specific terminal mode activation, and environment variable checks. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data collection. It imports only internal modules and standard libraries. The environment variable checks align with common practices for enabling/disabling color output. The Windows terminal mode function uses ctypes for terminal configuration, which is a legitimate platform-specific operation. There are no indicators of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. All functions appear to serve legitimate formatting purposes, and no suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard terminal styling utility with platform support, environment variable handling, and no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It does not include or invoke any potentially harmful actions. Overall security risk is very low.",
