{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for styling terminal output with colors and styles, primarily focusing on terminal compatibility and ANSI escape code generation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), system calls for Windows terminal configuration, input parameters for styling functions.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; functions generate ANSI codes for styling text but do not execute or transmit untrusted data beyond terminal output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (style names, color values) flow into style computation functions, which generate ANSI escape codes for terminal styling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. The code includes standard terminal styling and environment checks, which are common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script defines styling classes and functions for terminal output, with environment-aware toggling and Windows terminal mode setup. It uses system environment variables to control coloring but does not read or write sensitive data or perform network operations. All system calls are limited to configuring the Windows console mode for better color support, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic are present. The code operates solely within the scope of terminal styling and environment detection, with no evidence of data exfiltration, remote control, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal styling utility with standard environment checks and Windows console configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It is safe for use in Python projects for terminal styling purposes.",
