  "purpose": "Define color codes and utility methods for terminal text formatting, including dynamic attribute access for color validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from library modules, class attribute definitions, class methods (rgb, RGB).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static attribute definitions and straightforward method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for terminal color formatting, using class attributes populated from external libraries. It includes dynamic attribute access with validation via __getattr__ and methods for RGB color code generation. No input validation beyond attribute access, no network activity, no code execution, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be standard for styling terminal output, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended for terminal color styling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
