{
  "purpose": "Define color formatting classes for terminal output with dynamic attribute access and RGB color support.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions). Class variables initialized from Library constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code primarily constructs and returns formatted strings based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (r, g, b) passed to rgb() / RGB() methods, processed by Utilities, then returned as formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation via vars() in a class definition is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No external network access, file system modifications, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for colored terminal output, overriding attribute access for error handling, and dynamically creating color variables from a Library. The rgb() method processes RGB values, potentially converting percentages via Utilities.is_percentage. No external data sources, network communication, or secret storage found. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a utility module for formatting terminal colors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal color formatting. No malicious behavior detected. The dynamic variable creation is unusual but not harmful. No security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
