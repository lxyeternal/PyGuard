{
  "purpose": "Defines color formatting classes for terminal output, including dynamic attribute access and RGB color support.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attributes, and methods with internal logic.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted input, network operations, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute handling via __getattr__ and dynamic variable assignment with vars(), which are common in such utility modules but could be misused if misused elsewhere. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes classes for terminal color formatting with methods for RGB color codes. It overrides attribute access to raise custom exceptions for invalid colors. Uses dynamic variable assignment to set color constants based on imported library data. No network or system calls, no external input handling, and no data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected. The code appears to be a benign utility for terminal output styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for managing terminal colors with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It uses dynamic attribute handling and class inheritance in a controlled manner. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
