  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign terminal color utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic vars() usage, while somewhat unusual, is controlled and typical for such modules. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is found. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero."
