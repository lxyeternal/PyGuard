{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for terminal color formatting, including dynamic color variables and RGB color support.",
  "sources": "Reads from imported modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attributes, and method parameters (r, g, b).",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting to generate ANSI escape sequences for colors; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (r, g, b) flow through utils.is_percentage() and into string formatting to produce color codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of dynamic vars() for setting color variables is standard for such utility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs terminal color escape sequences using predefined constants and supports RGB input. It overrides attribute access to raise custom exceptions for invalid colors. No external data leaks or network activity are present. The code appears straightforward, focusing on terminal output formatting, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal color output. No malicious behavior, security risks, or malware are detected. It functions solely to facilitate colored terminal text formatting.",
