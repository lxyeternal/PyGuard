  "purpose": "Terminal color formatting utility with dynamic color variables and RGB support.",
  "sources": "External library imports (Library, Utilities, InvalidColor), class attribute definitions, __getattr__ method, rgb and RGB class methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network activity, no external data handling.",
  "flows": "Class attribute initialization from external Library, dynamic variable creation via vars(), rgb methods calling Utilities.is_percentage, __getattr__ raising exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of vars() within class scope for dynamic variable creation; controlled but somewhat unconventional pattern in such utility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a terminal color utility with dynamic attribute creation based on external library constants, RGB support, and error handling via __getattr__. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The use of vars() for dynamic variable assignment is typical in such contexts, though unconventional. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The __getattr__ override raises exceptions for invalid colors, indicating proper validation. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign terminal color utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dynamic vars() usage, while somewhat unusual, is controlled and typical for such modules. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks is found. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
