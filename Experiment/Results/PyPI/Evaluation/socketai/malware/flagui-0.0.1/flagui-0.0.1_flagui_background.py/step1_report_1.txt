  "purpose": "Define a class for managing terminal background colors, including named colors and RGB values, with custom attribute handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attributes, class methods, and dynamic variable assignments within the class.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in rgb and RGB methods, attribute access via __getattr__, dynamic variable assignment (vars()[_color])",
  "flows": "Input parameters to rgb and RGB methods flow into string formatting for color codes; attribute access triggers __getattr__, which may raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ in MetaBack to raise an exception for invalid colors; dynamic assignment of class variables based on a dictionary from an external module; no use of eval or exec; no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass MetaBack that raises an InvalidColor exception if an undefined attribute (color) is accessed, which prevents silent failures for invalid color names. The Back class initializes several class variables from an imported Library module, including color codes and escape sequences. It dynamically creates class variables for each color, mapping color names to terminal escape sequences. The rgb and RGB class methods generate RGB background color strings, converting percentage inputs if needed via a utility function. There is a deprecated subclass back that only serves as a placeholder. No input sources (e.g., user input, network) are present, and no sinks (e.g., output to network or files) indicate malicious data flow. The dynamic assignment of color variables is standard and not suspicious. Overall, the code seems to serve a color management purpose with safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a terminal color management class with safe attribute handling and dynamic variable creation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only noteworthy feature is the custom attribute error handling via __getattr__, which is benign in this context. The code appears secure and intended solely for styling terminal output.",
