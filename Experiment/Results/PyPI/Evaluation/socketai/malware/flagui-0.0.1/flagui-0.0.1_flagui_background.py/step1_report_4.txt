  "purpose": "Define a class for managing terminal background colors, including color codes and RGB background formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions); class attributes and class methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of input parameters in rgb() and RGB() methods if inputs are maliciously crafted, but internally validated by Utilities.",
  "flows": "Input parameters in rgb() and RGB() flow through cls._utils.is_percentage() before being used in string formatting for RGB codes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute setting via vars() in class definition; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass and a class for terminal color manipulation, including RGB formatting. It imports internal modules, which are not suspicious. The rgb() method processes inputs via Utilities.is_percentage, which should validate or convert inputs. The use of vars() to dynamically set class variables based on imported color codes is a standard pattern, not malicious. No external data input handling, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for terminal coloring with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of terminal color management functions with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious payloads or suspicious logic.",
