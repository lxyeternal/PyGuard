  "purpose": "Provides terminal background color codes with dynamic attribute validation and RGB color generation methods.",
  "sources": "External modules Library, Utilities, and exceptions; class attribute access for color names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers __getattr__ in metaclass to validate color names; rgb() and RGB() methods generate color escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "Use of vars() for dynamic class variable creation; __getattr__ override for validation; reliance on external modules without review.",
  "analysis": "The code manages terminal color codes with safe dynamic attribute handling and RGB sequence generation. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The __getattr__ method raises exceptions for invalid colors, which is a standard validation pattern. External dependencies are assumed safe but unreviewed. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is utility-based, and its implementation is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It uses standard patterns for validation and dynamic variable assignment. The overall security risk is minimal.",
