{
  "purpose": "Define classes for managing terminal background colors with dynamic attribute handling and RGB support.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class variables, class methods, and the for loop initializing color variables.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code mainly defines constants and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation detected. The only dynamic attribute handling is via __getattr__ override, which raises an exception for invalid colors. No system commands, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass that raises an exception when an invalid color attribute is accessed. The Back class initializes color codes from a presumed external Library module, dynamically creating class variables for each color. RGB methods process input values, converting percentages if necessary, via an internal Utilities class. No input from external sources or outputs to untrusted locations is evident. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward terminal color management module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal color utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard patterns for dynamic attribute management and color code handling, with no evident malicious intent.",
