  "purpose": "Define classes for handling terminal background colors with dynamic attribute access and RGB color support.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attributes, and class methods.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is being sent to external systems, network, or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ in MetaBack to override attribute access, which raises exceptions for invalid colors; no malicious behavior but a custom attribute handling pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass to handle attribute access errors by raising exceptions. The Back class initializes color codes from a Library module and dynamically creates class variables for each color. It provides methods to generate RGB background color codes. No hardcoded secrets, no external data input, and no suspicious code flows are present. The dynamic attribute handling is a standard pattern for color validation, not malicious. No obfuscated code or malware-like behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of terminal color handling with custom error handling for invalid attributes. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code fragment.",
