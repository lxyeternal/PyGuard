  "purpose": "Generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal cursor and display control, validating input types and control existence.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name', 'row', 'column'; validation via Utilities.is_control_exist.",
  "sinks": "Constructed escape sequence strings; no external data or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input validation -> control existence check -> escape sequence construction -> return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Utility method's internal behavior is unknown but presumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation and constructs escape sequences for terminal control. No network activity, file access, or malicious patterns are present. The utility functions and string formatting are standard. The control existence check is a benign validation step. No obfuscation or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured terminal control utility with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1), justified by the simplicity and safety of the implementation.",
