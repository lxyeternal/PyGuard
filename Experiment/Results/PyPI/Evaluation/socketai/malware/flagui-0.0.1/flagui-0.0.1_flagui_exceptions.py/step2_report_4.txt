  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes.\n- There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- Several reports note the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self)` instead of `super().__init__()`, which is a minor implementation mistake but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code only contains class definitions with standard exception handling. No malicious or suspicious elements are detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The main flaw is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of the more conventional `super().__init__(message)`. This may cause runtime errors in some cases but does not introduce security risks.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n\n  - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n  - **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n  The **risk scores** are also 0, aligning with the conclusion that there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Super() usage:** Several reports mention the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self)`. This is a coding mistake but not malicious. The scores remain appropriate.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  No claims are made that are based on unwarranted assumptions. The analysis correctly states that the code is benign.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions:**\n\n- The code is harmless, standard exception class definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The minor coding mistake does not affect security but should be corrected for proper functionality.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected                               |\n| obfuscated       | 0                 | Clear, straightforward class definitions                     |\n| security risk    | 0                 | No external data handling, no suspicious operations        |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Issues present?** Yes, minor coding mistake in `super()` usage, but no security impact.\n- **Malware score?** Correctly 0.\n- **Obfuscated?** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk score?** Correctly 0.\n- **Potential improvements:** Fix the `super()` calls for correctness, but this does not influence security assessment.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate.",
