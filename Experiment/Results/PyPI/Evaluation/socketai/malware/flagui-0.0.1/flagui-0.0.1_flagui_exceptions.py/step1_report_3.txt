{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling invalid colors, styles, and controls in a program.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "targets": "None; there are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or used.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from external input to potentially dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant use of 'super(Exception, self).__init__(message)' instead of 'super().__init__(message)'; no harmful behavior or obfuscation present. Exception classes are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes, each with an init method that calls the superclass constructor and stores a message. The __str__ method returns the message. The implementation is standard and does not perform any suspicious actions. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions with no malicious or security-related concerns. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a larger application.",
