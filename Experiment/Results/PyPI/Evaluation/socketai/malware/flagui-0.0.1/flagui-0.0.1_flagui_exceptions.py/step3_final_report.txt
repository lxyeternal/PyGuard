{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling invalid colors, styles, and controls in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class initializations with message parameters, no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with messages; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect use of super() syntax (`super(Exception, self).__init__(message)`) instead of `super().__init__(message)`, which could cause runtime errors but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward custom exception class definitions. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are present. The only technical flaw is the improper use of super(), which is a coding mistake, not a security issue. No obfuscation, data leaks, or suspicious constructs are detected. The malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, all aligning with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception classes with a minor implementation mistake that does not pose security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present.",
