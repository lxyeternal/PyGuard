  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling invalid input errors related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "No data input sources detected; code does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data handling present; no data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, each inheriting from Python's Exception. Each class initializes with a message string and defines a __str__ method to return that message. No input/output operations, network calls, environment variable usage, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be a standard pattern for custom exceptions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of custom exception classes with no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any data handling, network activity, or obfuscated operations. Overall, it is safe and standard for error handling purposes.",
