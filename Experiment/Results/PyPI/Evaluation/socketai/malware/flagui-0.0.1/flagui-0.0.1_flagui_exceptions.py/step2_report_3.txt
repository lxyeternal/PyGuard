  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- All reports agree that there are no external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors.\n- Several reports note the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of `super().__init__(message)`. This is a coding mistake but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, data leaks, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Individual report assessments:**\n\n**Report 1 & 2 & 3 & 5:**\n\n- All correctly identify that the code is benign, with no security risks.\n- The scores assigned (`malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level is 1, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No issues detected or overlooked.\n\n**Score adjustment suggestion:** None needed. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Correctly notes the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)`.\n- Also states that this mistake could cause runtime errors but is not malicious.\n- The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), which is appropriate given the minor implementation mistake.\n- The malware and security risk scores are 0, which is correct.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Score adjustment suggestion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- The code is a set of simple custom exception classes.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- Minor coding mistake in `super()` calls, but not malicious.\n- No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity or payloads detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — The code poses no security risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the existing scores. The only minor point is the incorrect use of `super()`, which is a coding error but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. There are no malicious or security issues present. The code appears to be a standard, benign component of a larger application, with no obfuscation or malware.\n\n**My final estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and well-understood. The reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
