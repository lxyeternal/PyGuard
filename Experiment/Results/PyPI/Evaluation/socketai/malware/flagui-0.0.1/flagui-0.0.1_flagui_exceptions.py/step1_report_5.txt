{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various invalid input scenarios related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions with standard initialization and string methods. There are no input handling, data processing, external calls, or potentially malicious constructs. The inheritance from Exception is standard, but the use of 'super(Exception, self)' is unconventional; typically, 'super().__init__(message)' is used. Nonetheless, this does not pose security concerns. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
