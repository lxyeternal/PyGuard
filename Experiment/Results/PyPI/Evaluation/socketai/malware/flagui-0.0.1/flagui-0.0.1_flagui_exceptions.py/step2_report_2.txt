  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the details:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception.\n- Each class initializes with a message and overrides __str__ to return that message.\n- No input/output operations, external data handling, or network interactions are present.\n- The code is straightforward and appears to be standard exception class definitions.\n- Minor implementation issue: the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of the conventional `super().__init__(message)`. This is a coding mistake but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or signs of malware.\n- The purpose seems to be for input validation or error handling in a larger application context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **No malicious behavior or security risks** are evident.\n- The only notable flaw is the incorrect use of `super()` which could cause runtime errors but is not security-related.\n- No data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted sources are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0, no security issues.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it; the code is benign.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The only change I would suggest is correcting the `super()` calls for proper function, but this does not impact security.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are accurate in their analysis.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (since no security risk or malicious behavior is present)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, standard set of custom exception classes with a minor implementation mistake that does not affect security. The overall security posture is safe, and the scores should remain at zero for malware and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and I concur with their assessments. The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The only improvement is fixing the `super()` calls, but this does not alter the security evaluation.",
