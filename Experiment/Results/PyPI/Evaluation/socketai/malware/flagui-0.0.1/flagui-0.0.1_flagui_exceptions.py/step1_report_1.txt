  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling invalid color, style, and control inputs.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; exceptions are instantiated with messages, but no data sources are read from files, networks, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes with constructors and string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward class definitions with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class, initializing with a message attribute and overriding __str__. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of custom exception classes used for input validation or error handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses no security threat.",
