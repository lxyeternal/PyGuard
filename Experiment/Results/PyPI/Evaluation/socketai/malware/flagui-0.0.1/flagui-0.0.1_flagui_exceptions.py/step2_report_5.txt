  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception.\n- All classes initialize with a message attribute and override __str__ to return that message.\n- No external data sources, input/output operations, network calls, or data processing are present.\n- The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n- Some reports note the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of `super().__init__(message)`, which is a minor implementation mistake but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or signs of malware are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of code:** The code matches the description; no discrepancies.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None observed; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** The code is benign; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The incorrect use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` is noted in some reports. While this is a mistake that could cause runtime errors, it does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The reports correctly identify this as a minor flaw, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0               | 0                | 0            | No malicious activity or obfuscation; code is simple class definitions. |\n| 2       | 0               | 0                | 0            | Same reasoning; benign exception class definitions. |\n| 3       | 0               | 0                | 0            | Straightforward code; minor mistake in super() call but no security impact. |\n| 4       | 0               | 0                | 0            | No obfuscation or malware; minor implementation error. |\n| 5       | 0               | 0                | 0            | No malicious or suspicious elements; standard exception classes. |\n\n---\n\n### Final thoughts:\n\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- The overall security posture of this code is benign.\n- The only noteworthy point is the incorrect use of `super()` syntax, which is a coding mistake but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a harmless, straightforward set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
