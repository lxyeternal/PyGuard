  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various invalid inputs related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The super() constructor calls are incorrectly implemented, using super(Exception, self) instead of super().__init__(message). This may cause runtime errors but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes with messages. All classes inherit from Exception and store messages. The super() calls are incorrectly using super(Exception, self), which is a common mistake but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious operations are present. No obfuscated code or malware-like behavior is detected. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as part of a larger application for handling color and style validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple class definitions for exceptions with a minor implementation mistake. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
