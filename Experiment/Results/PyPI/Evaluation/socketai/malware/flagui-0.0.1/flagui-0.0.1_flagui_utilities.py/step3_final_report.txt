  "purpose": "Utility functions for color, style, and control validation and conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads from internal dictionaries (Library.COLORS, HEX_COLORS, STYLES, CONTROLS, COLORTERM), environment variable 'COLORTERM', and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable 'COLORTERM' (read/write), exception raising on invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation functions -> exception or return; environment variable 'COLORTERM' -> setting/getting value.",
  "anomalies": "Recomputes percentage mappings on each call in 'convert_percentages' (inefficient but not malicious); environment variable manipulation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation against internal dictionaries, manages the 'COLORTERM' environment variable, and converts percentage strings to numeric color values. No external network activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is standard. The dynamic percentage mapping is normal, though recalculating it each time is inefficient. Environment variable handling is typical for terminal styling utilities. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling validation and conversion. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable manipulation is standard and does not pose a security risk in this context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal environmental impact but no malicious intent.",
