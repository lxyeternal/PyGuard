  "purpose": "Utility class for handling colors, styles, and controls in a terminal-related library.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.getenv), input parameters (name, colorterm, numbers, percent), and data from imported libraries (Library).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to environment variables (os.environ['COLORTERM']) and raises exceptions based on input validation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated against internal dictionaries; environment variables are read or set; percentages are converted and validated; exceptions are raised for invalid styles, colors, or controls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The environment variable manipulation is typical for configuration. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for colors, styles, and controls against predefined dictionaries. It converts percentage strings to color values with appropriate bounds. Environment variables are read and set for 'COLORTERM'. The functions raise exceptions for invalid inputs, but do not execute or process untrusted data in a harmful way. No external network calls, file modifications, or malicious behavior are evident. The use of environment variables and exception raising is standard and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for color and style validation and management within a terminal-based library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated parts or suspicious activities.",
