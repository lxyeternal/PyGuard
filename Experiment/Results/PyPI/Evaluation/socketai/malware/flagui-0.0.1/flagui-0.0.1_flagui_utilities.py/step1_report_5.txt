  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating colors, styles, controls, and converting percentages for color values within a terminal styling library.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), function parameters (colorterm, percent, name), internal class attributes (Library constants).",
  "sinks": "Environment variable modification (os.environ['COLORTERM']) potentially influencing terminal behavior.",
  "flows": "set_colorterm() can set environment variable based on input, is_color_exist/is_style_exist/is_control_exist validate input against internal data, convert_percentages maps percentage strings to numbers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of environment variables is standard but can influence environment configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation and conversion functions related to terminal color styling. It reads environment variables and modifies them, which is typical for such utilities. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior observed. The functions perform straightforward validation and conversion tasks, with proper exception handling. No obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors detected. Environment variable setting could potentially affect terminal behavior but is not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for terminal styling with no signs of malicious intent. It correctly validates inputs, manages environment variables responsibly, and performs necessary conversions. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
