  "purpose": "Utility functions for color, style, and control validation and conversion in a terminal styling library.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COLORTERM', function parameters (name, colorterm, numbers, percent), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable setting 'os.environ['COLORTERM']' and potential misuse of input data in functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation functions → environment variable set or read → color conversions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No unusual or obfuscated code. Use of environment variables is standard. The function 'convert_percentages' dynamically creates a percentage-to-number mapping, which is normal. No hidden backdoors or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of color, style, and control names against predefined dictionaries, raising exceptions if invalid. It also converts percentage strings to numerical color values, using a dictionary generated at runtime. The environment variable 'COLORTERM' is read and set in a controlled manner. The methods operate on input parameters without external or secret data. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The functions follow expected patterns for a terminal styling library, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility class for terminal styling validation and conversion, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely manages environment variables and validates inputs against known sets. No malicious or supply chain attack behavior is present.",
