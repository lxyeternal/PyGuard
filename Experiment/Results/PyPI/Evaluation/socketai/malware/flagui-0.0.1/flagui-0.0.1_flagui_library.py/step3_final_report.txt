{
  "purpose": "Static collection of terminal styling constants, including escape sequences, color mappings, control sequences, and environment variable values, used for terminal text formatting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data are hardcoded static strings and dictionaries within the class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines static constants without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data class containing terminal styling constants, with no functions, input/output, or dynamic behavior. It does not read external data, execute code, or perform network operations. The large static dictionaries are typical for styling utilities. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are present. The code's static nature and lack of dynamic or external interactions indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static resource defining terminal styling constants, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, and securityRisk: 0.0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
