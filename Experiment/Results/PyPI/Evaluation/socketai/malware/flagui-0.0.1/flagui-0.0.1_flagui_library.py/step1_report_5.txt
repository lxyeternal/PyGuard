{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class containing terminal color and control sequence constants and mappings.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reads; all data is static within the class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing beyond static attribute assignments and dictionary definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Contains extensive static color and control sequence data; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a data class with various constants and dictionaries related to terminal control sequences, colors, and styles. It does not perform any runtime operations, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The large static datasets are typical for terminal styling purposes and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration class providing terminal styling constants. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, and no security risks are identified.",
