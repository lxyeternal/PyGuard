  "purpose": "Define a data structure encapsulating terminal color codes, control sequences, and environment variable mappings for styling terminal output.",
  "sources": "Class attributes containing color codes, control sequences, environment variable mappings, and data dictionaries for color values.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no code writes untrusted data, performs network communication, or executes external commands.",
  "flows": "Data is static within class attributes; no dynamic data flow from input to output is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code consists of static mappings and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a @dataclass 'Library' with numerous class attributes representing color codes, control sequences, and environment variable mappings. All data are statically assigned strings or dictionaries, with no runtime input, environment variable reading, or dynamic code execution. There are no functions or methods performing operations beyond static assignments. No network activity, file I/O, or command execution is present. The structure appears to be a static utility module for terminal styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static data definitions intended for terminal styling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activities are present. It appears to be a benign utility class with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
