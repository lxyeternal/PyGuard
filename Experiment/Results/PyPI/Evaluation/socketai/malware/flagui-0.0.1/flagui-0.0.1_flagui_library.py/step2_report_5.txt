  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Code Content Summary:**\n   - The code defines a `@dataclass` named `Library`.\n   - It contains static constants for ANSI escape sequences, color codes, control sequences, environment variable mappings, and color dictionaries.\n   - All data are statically defined; no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external interactions.\n   - No functions or methods perform any processing or logic beyond data storage.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as a static collection of terminal styling constants.\n   - They emphasize the absence of dynamic code, input processing, external data, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1.0, with malware and security risk scores at 0.0.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Logical Validity of the Reports:**\n   - The reports are accurate. The code is a benign static resource module.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n   - The data is extensive but purely static, serving as configuration or utility constants.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 is appropriate; code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.0 is appropriate; static data with no dynamic or external interactions.\n\n5. **Potential for Hidden Risks or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - Given the static nature, the code cannot execute malicious actions.\n   - No external data handling or code execution is present.\n   - The large static datasets are typical for terminal styling and do not pose security issues.\n\n6. **Any Reason to Adjust Scores?**\n   - No. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n7. **Final Expert Estimation:**\n   - **Malware:** 0.0\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n   - **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign static utility module defining terminal styling constants. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0.0             |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.0             |\n| Security Risk   | 0.0             |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed analysis, confirming the code's safety and benign intent.",
