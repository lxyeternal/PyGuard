{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class containing various color and control sequence constants for terminal styling and control.",
  "sources": "Class attributes initialized with static string and dictionary values; no external input or data reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No code that processes untrusted data or sends data to external systems; no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A – all data is statically defined within the class; no dynamic data flows or transformations observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code primarily consists of static mappings for terminal color codes and controls.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward definition of a data class containing constants related to terminal control sequences, color codes, and environment variable values. There are no input processing, data manipulations, network communications, or any dynamic behavior. The absence of functions, input/output, or external interactions suggests it is a utility or configuration module. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign collection of terminal styling constants and color mappings with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It serves as a static resource for terminal-related styling purposes.",
