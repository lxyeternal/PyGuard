  "purpose": "Define a data class 'Library' containing various ANSI escape sequences, color codes, and related constants for terminal text styling and coloring.",
  "sources": "None. The code primarily defines static constants and data structures; it does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists as there are no input or output operations involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. All variables are class-level constants with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static data container defining ANSI escape sequences and color mappings. It uses dataclasses for organization, with no dynamic code, user input handling, or external data dependencies. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are detected. The structure and content are typical for terminal styling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration for terminal color and style codes. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this module.",
