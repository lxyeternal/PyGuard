{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class for ANSI escape sequences, color codes, and control sequences for terminal styling and control.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; all data are static class variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform output operations with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all variables are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Contains extensive static data mappings and control sequences without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class containing constants for terminal styling, colors, and control sequences. There are no input/output operations, no network connections, no code execution, nor any suspicious logic. It appears to serve as a utility module for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for terminal styling sequences and color mappings. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to provide static configuration data.",
