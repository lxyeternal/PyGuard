{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'flagui', including its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are limited to the package metadata and static dependencies defined in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data handling or external data output; the code only sets up package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code performs static configuration without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. Usage of 'setuptools' and static dependencies is standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, author, and description. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external network activity is present. The 'install_requires' field specifies a fixed, known version of 'requests', which is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears legitimate with no suspicious activity.",
