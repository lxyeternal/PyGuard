  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'flagui' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs; it primarily defines static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output channels are present; the code does not handle user input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines static package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The dependency version is explicitly specified but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools, defines package metadata including name, version, author, description, and required dependencies. It uses find_packages() to automatically include subpackages. All operations are standard for Python packaging scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, credential handling, or code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project named 'flagui'. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The dependency specification is explicit and safe. Overall, the script appears benign and standard for Python package setup.",
