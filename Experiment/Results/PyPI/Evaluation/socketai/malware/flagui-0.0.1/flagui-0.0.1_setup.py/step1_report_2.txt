{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'flagui' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads package configuration data such as package name, version, author, description, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the static configuration parameters into the package setup process; no dynamic or untrusted input sources are used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code follows standard setup.py conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup functions from setuptools, defines package metadata, and specifies a fixed dependency. All code appears straightforward and conventional for package configuration. No hidden or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The dependencies are explicit and version-locked, reducing risk of supply chain attacks. The code is minimal and uses standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script for package distribution with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard.",
