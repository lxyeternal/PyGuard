  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'flagui' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, description; explicit dependency declaration in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, standard, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools functions, defines package metadata, specifies dependencies explicitly, and uses find_packages() for subpackage inclusion. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated segments are present. All reports confirm its benign, standard nature, with scores indicating no malicious or security concerns. The explicit dependency version minimizes supply chain risks. The code's static, straightforward structure aligns with best practices, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
