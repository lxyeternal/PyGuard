{
  "purpose": "To provide a colored print function for enhanced console output with optional styling and colors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the cprint() function, especially 'text', 'fore_256', 'back_256', 'fore_rgb', 'back_rgb', 'formatting', 'line_color', and 'reset'.",
  "sinks": "The print() function call which outputs styled text to the console.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are used to construct styled text, which is then passed to print() (sink) for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no access to sensitive data. The code mainly manipulates styling parameters for print output.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling functions and classes from a local module, then defines a function to print colored/styled text. It processes color parameters, defaults, and style options, then constructs a formatted string for printing. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, suspicious data flows, or obfuscated code. The logic is straightforward, serving a cosmetic purpose for console output. No external network activity, no suspicious imports, or hidden code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function designed for styled printing. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
