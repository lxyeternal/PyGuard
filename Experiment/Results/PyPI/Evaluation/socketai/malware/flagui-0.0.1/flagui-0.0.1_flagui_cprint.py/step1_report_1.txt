  "purpose": "Custom print function with color and style formatting support for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: text, fore_256, back_256, fore_rgb, back_rgb, formatting, line_color, reset, and additional kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs formatted text to the console; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the construction of styled text, which is then printed to stdout; no data flows outside standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily wraps a print statement with styling capabilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for styled printing using color parameters and external functions for color formatting. It imports from a module '.colored' but does not dynamically execute or evaluate untrusted data beyond parameter passing. No network connections, file operations, or system modifications are present. No obfuscation, malicious injections, or malicious logic is observed. The function simply formats and prints styled text based on input parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function designed for styled terminal output. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware. The only potential security concern could relate to misuse of input parameters to generate malicious terminal output, but this is not inherently malicious or risky.",
