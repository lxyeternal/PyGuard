{
  "purpose": "To provide a colored and styled print function that outputs styled text to the console.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: text, fore_256, back_256, fore_rgb, back_rgb, formatting, line_color, reset, and additional keyword arguments (**kwargs).",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs styled text, but there are no direct sinks that send data over a network, write to files, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct styled string components (foreground, background, style, terminator), which are then combined and passed to print().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; the functions called (Colored, foreground_rgb, background_rgb) are imported and assumed benign. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a styled print function that utilizes external modules and functions to generate colored/styled output. It performs parameter processing, conditional color setting, and then outputs styled text. No untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The imported functions and modules are not suspicious by themselves. The logic appears straightforward and intended for aesthetic console output. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a styled print utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply formats and outputs styled text to the console using standard functions and imported modules. No malicious activity or sabotage evident.",
