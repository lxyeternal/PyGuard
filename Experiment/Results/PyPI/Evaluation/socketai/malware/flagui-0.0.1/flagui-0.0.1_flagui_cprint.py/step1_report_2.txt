  "purpose": "A custom print function to display colored and styled text in the terminal.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as text, foreground and background color values, formatting options, and line color.",
  "sinks": "The built-in print() function, which outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "Parameters like 'text', 'fore_256', 'back_256', 'fore_rgb', 'back_rgb', and 'line_color' are processed to generate styled strings that are then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of imported modules appears to be for styling purposes. No external data sources or network activities are present. The function is primarily a styled print wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a print function that applies terminal color styling via helper functions and classes. It imports styling functions and uses conditional logic to determine color codes. It then constructs a styled string and calls the standard print() function. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a utility for aesthetic purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward styled print utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious activities or contain malicious behavior. It is safe and primarily used for enhancing terminal output aesthetics.",
