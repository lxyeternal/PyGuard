  "conclusion": "The code is a benign styled print utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The external modules are assumed safe, and the code does not perform any malicious actions. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) is overly cautious; a score of 0 is justified. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero."
