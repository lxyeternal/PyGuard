  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious activity due to the obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during setup. The package setup appears legitimate, but the embedded command's obfuscation and execution context pose a serious security risk. Scores assigned are consistent with the suspicious pattern observed. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
