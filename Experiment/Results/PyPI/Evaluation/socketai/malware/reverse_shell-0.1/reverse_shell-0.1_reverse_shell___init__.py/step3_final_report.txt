  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in Python packages, focusing on obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code sections involving dynamic code execution, environment variable access, network calls, and input handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file system modifications, environment variable leaks, or system commands executed via eval or exec.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated code or input data flow into dynamic execution points or network functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval/exec, ambiguous variable names, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network domains.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively indicate that obfuscation and dynamic code features are key signals. Reports 1 and 5 show high obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent, especially when combined with ambiguous data handling. Reports 2 and 3 are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, and their low scores reflect benign behavior. Report 4 lacks code, so no analysis is possible. The scores are generally consistent with the described behaviors. Report 5's higher malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) scores are justified by the presence of obfuscation and dynamic features. The overall risk scores align with the suspicion levels, with moderate concern for reports 1 and 5, and low for others.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with the exception of report 5, which exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting further investigation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Static and dynamic analysis should be prioritized for obfuscated code to confirm malicious intent.",
