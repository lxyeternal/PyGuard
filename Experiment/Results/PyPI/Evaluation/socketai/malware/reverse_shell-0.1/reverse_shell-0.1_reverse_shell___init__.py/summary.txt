  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with the exception of report 5, which exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting further investigation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Static and dynamic analysis should be prioritized for obfuscated code to confirm malicious intent."
