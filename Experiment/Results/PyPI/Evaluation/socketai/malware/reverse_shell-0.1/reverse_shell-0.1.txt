      "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; however, the package name and entry point suggest potential for malicious reverse shell activity if the 'connect' function is implemented maliciously. Current scores are reasonable; malware likelihood is very low (0.1), obfuscation absent (0), and moderate security risk (0.4) due to naming suspicion. Further review of the 'connect' implementation is necessary for definitive assessment."

The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Static and dynamic analysis should be prioritized for obfuscated code to confirm malicious intent."
