  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; however, the package name and entry point suggest potential for malicious reverse shell activity if the 'connect' function is implemented maliciously. Current scores are reasonable; malware likelihood is very low (0.1), obfuscation absent (0), and moderate security risk (0.4) due to naming suspicion. Further review of the 'connect' implementation is necessary for definitive assessment."
