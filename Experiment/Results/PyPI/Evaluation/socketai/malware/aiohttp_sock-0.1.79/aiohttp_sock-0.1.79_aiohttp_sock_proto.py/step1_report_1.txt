{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous Python implementation for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client connections, including negotiation, address resolution, and data transmission functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the network via socket.recv() and socket.send(), address resolution via getaddrinfo(), and configuration via function parameters and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over network sockets, especially in the _send() and connect() methods; address resolution results; socket operations; exception handling that could lead to resource leaks if not properly managed.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, ports, credentials) flow into connection setup and authentication functions; then data flows through socket send/recv calls during negotiation and data transfer; errors can cause resource cleanup or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic address resolution and socket connections appears standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling detected; no obfuscated code or hidden data processing observed; error messages include standard SOCKS errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SOCKS proxy negotiation, including handling both SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, with support for username/password authentication and remote or local DNS resolution. It manages network connections asynchronously, with error handling and resource cleanup. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present. The code adheres to typical design patterns for proxy connections, with no indicators of sabotage or malware activity. The only potential concern is that socket connections are established and closed correctly, but this is standard for network code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of SOCKS proxy clients, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It performs expected operations for proxy negotiation and data transmission without suspicious behaviors or backdoors.",
