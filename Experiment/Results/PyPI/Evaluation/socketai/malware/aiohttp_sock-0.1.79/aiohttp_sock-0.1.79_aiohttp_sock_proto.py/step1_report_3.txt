{
  "purpose": "The code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers to facilitate proxy connections asynchronously, supporting authentication and address resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hostnames/IP addresses, ports, and optional user credentials (username/password). These are used when establishing proxy connections and resolving addresses.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over socket connections to the proxy server and for resolving hostnames. The code also performs network I/O but does not write to files or external systems directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (host, port, credentials) to socket send/receive operations. Address resolution flows into SOCKS request construction, with responses processed to establish connections.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for SOCKS proxy implementations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscation, unusual behaviors, or external data leaks are evident. No suspicious network activity or privacy violations are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an asynchronous SOCKS proxy client implementation supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols with optional username/password authentication. It performs address resolution, constructs protocol-specific requests, and handles server responses securely. The logic aligns with typical proxy connection workflows, with proper error handling and socket management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. All operations are consistent with legitimate proxy connection setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of SOCKS proxy client wrappers with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network behaviors. Overall, it is a legitimate, well-structured proxy client module.",
