{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS proxy socket wrappers supporting SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for use in asynchronous Python applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input from network sockets, environment variables, and potentially user-provided hostnames/IP addresses.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network sockets, especially during proxy negotiation and connection establishment, which could be exploited to inject malicious data or perform man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "flows": "Input hostnames/IP addresses are resolved and sent as part of SOCKS protocol requests; data flows from user or system input to network sockets during connect and negotiate functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. No evident malicious code or privacy leaks. Uses standard asyncio socket methods. The code appears structured and typical for proxy implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs proxy negotiation, resolution, and connection setup with SOCKS4/5 protocols. It uses safe practices for address resolution, socket management, and error handling. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external command execution, is evident. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments are present. It focuses solely on proxy connection handling, with proper exception handling for network errors. The overall implementation aligns with standard proxy client patterns without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation without malicious behavior. It handles network connections securely, performs necessary resolution, and manages proxy negotiation properly. No indicators of malware or malicious modifications are present.",
