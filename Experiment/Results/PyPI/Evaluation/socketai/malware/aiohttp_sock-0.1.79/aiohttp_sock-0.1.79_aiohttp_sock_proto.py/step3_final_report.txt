{
  "purpose": "This code implements SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy client wrappers, handling connection negotiation, address resolution, and data transfer over network sockets with support for authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data during socket communication (_send, _receive), address resolution (_resolve_addr), and during negotiation (_socks_auth, _socks_connect). It also reads configuration parameters such as host, port, username, password, and address info.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can flow from network responses (e.g., server replies during negotiation and address reading) to internal variables, and potentially to the network if the code is misused. The code does not contain explicit data leaks or insecure data handling, but network data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Source: Network responses or input parameters (host, port, credentials) -> Sink: Internal variables (e.g., response codes, address info) and network communication (sending requests, receiving replies). The flow includes address resolution, authentication, and connection establishment sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code follows standard practices for proxy communication. No unexpected dynamic code execution or misleading variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy clients, with proper error handling, asynchronous socket operations, and support for authentication. It manages address resolution, connection negotiation, and data transfer securely and transparently. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or hidden logic. The security risk stems from network exposure and credential handling, but these are typical for proxy clients and do not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is zero, obfuscation is zero, and the overall security risk is low (0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
