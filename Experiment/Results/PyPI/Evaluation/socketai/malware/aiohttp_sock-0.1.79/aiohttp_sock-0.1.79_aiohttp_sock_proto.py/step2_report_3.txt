  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code with the provided implementation, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SOCKS4/5 proxy client, no malicious behavior, handles negotiation, address resolution, data transfer. No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The code performs typical proxy functions, with no suspicious patterns. The low risk score seems appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Asynchronous SOCKS proxy wrappers with optional authentication, standard procedures, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is typical for such implementations, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores and reasoning are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy client wrappers, standard address resolution, no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies the code as legitimate, with no malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS proxy connection wrappers, standard practices, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning is consistent. The code appears standard and secure.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** SOCKS4/5 proxy classes, standard methods, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, routine error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning aligns with the code, which is a typical implementation.\n- **Verdict:** No issues with the report or scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.2, indicating low security risk. Given the code's functionality, this seems reasonable. The code does handle sensitive data like credentials, but it appears to be for legitimate proxy authentication, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or command execution. The scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation or code hiding is present.\n- **Risk:** The low risk score (0.2) is justified, considering the handling of credentials and network operations, but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, primarily due to credential handling and network operations, but standard for proxy implementations)\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports and scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
