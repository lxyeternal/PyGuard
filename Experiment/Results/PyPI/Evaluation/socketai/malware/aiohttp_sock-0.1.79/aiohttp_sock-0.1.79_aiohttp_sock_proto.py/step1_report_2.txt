{
  "purpose": "The code implements asynchronous proxy socket wrappers for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols, allowing connections through these proxies with optional authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads include socket data from the network, address resolution via getaddrinfo, and input data such as hostnames and credentials (user_id, username, password).",
  "sinks": "Network communication via sock_sendall and sock_recv functions, potentially transmitting or receiving untrusted data. Address resolution results and user credentials are used in network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (hostnames, credentials) flows through address resolution or directly into protocol request construction, then sent over the network. Responses from the proxy server are received and interpreted to establish the connection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The code correctly handles errors and does not contain evident malicious logic. It performs standard proxy negotiation procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, implementing standard SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols for proxy communication with appropriate error handling. It resolves hostnames, manages authentication, and reads server responses securely. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. It uses typical async socket operations, with no suspicious data flows or unusual code patterns. The only notable aspect is the handling of credentials, which appears to be designed for legitimate proxy authentication purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SOCKS proxy wrappers with no indicators of malicious intent. It performs expected functions for proxy negotiation and data transmission, with proper error handling. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident.",
