{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization or __init__.py file for a Python proxy handling library, importing internal components and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto), and the version string __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data or execute logic beyond imports and symbol definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package, importing internal components related to proxy connections, errors, helpers, and protocol types. It defines a version string and an __all__ list for public API exposure. There are no network operations, data handling, user input, or dynamic code execution. The code is static and organized, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or risky operations. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for a proxy library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and should remain at zero.",
