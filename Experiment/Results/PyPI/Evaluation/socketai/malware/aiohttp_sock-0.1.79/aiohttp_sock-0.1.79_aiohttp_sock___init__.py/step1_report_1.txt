{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a Python package related to proxy connections, including importing necessary components and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external connections in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code primarily sets up imports and exports without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes and functions from local modules, sets a version string, and defines what symbols are exported. There are no external network operations, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious behaviors. The structure is typical for a Python package's init or setup file. All imported modules seem related to proxy handling and errors, consistent with legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely organizes and exposes components for use elsewhere in the package.",
