{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API and imports for a proxy handling module, likely related to SOCKS proxy connections.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto). No external or untrusted data sources are read within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or execution commands are present; the code only imports and declares variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; all code is standard for a Python module defining exports and importing internal components.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs import statements, variable declarations (__version__, __all__), and module exports. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module setup file that imports internal components and defines the public API. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code segment.",
