{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define and export components related to a SOCKS proxy client, including error classes, connection helpers, and proxy type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flow pathways to untrusted data, as this code mainly defines imports, constants, and exports",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths observed; primarily module setup and exporting symbols",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns present. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components related to proxy connections and errors, then defines a version string and exports symbols for external use. It serves as a module's entry point, organizing and exposing functionalities. No data processing, user input, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are performed within this snippet. The simplicity and clarity reduce suspicion of malicious intent. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a SOCKS proxy client library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. It functions as an organizational and import/export component with no signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
