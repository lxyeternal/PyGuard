  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup: importing internal components, defining version info, and exporting symbols.\n- No external network operations, user input handling, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module entry point for a proxy handling library, likely related to SOCKS proxies.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity is suspected.\n- The confidence level is high (1) across all reports, suggesting they are thorough and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n\n- **Code content matches the reports' descriptions:**  \n  The code snippet is purely import/export declarations with no logic, no data flow, and no external effects. All reports correctly identify this.\n\n- **Presence of malicious patterns or vulnerabilities:**  \n  No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security flaws. The code is standard and benign.\n\n- **Potential issues or anomalies:**  \n  None detected. The code is clean, with proper module organization.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate because the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are aligned with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence and unanimity across reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. The scores are appropriate, and no further action or concern is warranted.",
