  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports various classes and functions from local modules (.connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto).\n- Defines a version string (__version__ = \"0.1.2\").\n- Sets __all__ to specify the public API.\n- Contains no dynamic code, no network activity, no data processing, no secrets, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- All describe the code as a standard module setup for a proxy library, with no suspicious activity, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malware indications.  \n- They correctly identify that the code only imports and exports symbols, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It is a straightforward module initialization script.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not overlook any potential issues, as none are present.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - Malware: 0 in all reports — justified, as there's no malware.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n  - Security risk: 0 — justified.\n  - Risk score: 0 in all reports — appropriate, since no vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities where none exist. They recognize the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n  Since no issues are present, raising the risk score would be unwarranted.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a typical, benign module setup with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk in this code snippet. The scores are justified and should remain at zero.",
