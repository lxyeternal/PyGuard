{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module for handling proxy connections, including importing related components and defining module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network or file operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from external input to sensitive sinks; primarily imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no hidden backdoors or malicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, exception class imports, and module attribute definitions. It imports classes, functions, and constants from local modules related to proxy handling. There are no functions, network calls, or data processing logic present that could be exploited. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are identified. The structure suggests standard library or package setup code for a proxy handling library.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard module setup file for a proxy-related package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this fragment.",
