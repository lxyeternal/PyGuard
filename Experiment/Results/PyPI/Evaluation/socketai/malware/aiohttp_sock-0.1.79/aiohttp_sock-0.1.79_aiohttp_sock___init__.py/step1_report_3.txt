{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and expose components of a proxy connection library, including error classes, connection functions, and protocol types.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .connector, .errors, .helpers, .proto",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or external effects; no network or file operations are directly performed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from input sources to sinks within this code; it mainly imports and re-exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected; the version string is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and functions from local modules and then exposes them via __all__ for external use. It defines a version string. There are no network operations, data handling, or environment variable usages here. The structure indicates a module setup for a proxy client or server, with no signs of malicious behavior. Since this is a module interface/entry point, it does not include code that could execute harmful actions. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup that re-exports components related to proxy handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be a benign, well-structured library component.",
