{
  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via SOCKS proxies, supporting proxy URL parsing and socket wrapping.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: socks_url, host, port, username, password, proxy_type, and other connection-related arguments.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, asyncio.open_connection, and loop.create_connection, which could be misused to establish network connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> parse_proxy_url (if socks_url provided) -> create_socket_wrapper -> connect socket -> establish connection via open_connection or create_connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code or backdoors; standard use of libraries; no obfuscated code; no signs of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious domain connections.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for establishing network connections through SOCKS proxies, including URL parsing, socket wrapping, and connection setup. The functions validate inputs and create socket wrappers accordingly. Usage of standard libraries (asyncio, socket, yarl) and established patterns suggests legitimate purpose. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident, such as hidden data leaks, command execution, or backdoors. The code appears to be a utility module for proxy-based connections, with proper input validation and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for establishing proxy connections asynchronously. It contains no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided content. The code serves its purpose for proxy connection management safely.",
