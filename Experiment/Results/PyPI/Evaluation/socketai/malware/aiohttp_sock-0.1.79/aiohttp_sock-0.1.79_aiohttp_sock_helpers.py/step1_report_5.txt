{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and manage SOCKS proxy connections asynchronously, allowing users to connect through SOCKS proxies to specified hosts and ports.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include: 'socks_url' parameter for proxy configuration, 'host' and 'port' parameters for target connection, environment variables or external inputs if passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can influence proxy configuration via 'socks_url', 'host', and 'port'. These are used to establish network connections, but there are no direct data leaks or harmful actions triggered by these flows within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL is parsed to extract connection parameters (source), which then influence socket creation and connection (sink). The flow from 'socks_url' to socket connection is the main pathway, with data used solely for establishing network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for proxy connections. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating SOCKS proxy connections using established libraries. It validates input parameters, parses proxy URLs, and manages socket connections asynchronously. The parsing function correctly decodes URL components. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code relies on user-provided inputs for configuration, which are properly validated before use. No suspicious behaviors, such as connecting to unknown domains or executing malicious payloads, are observed. The overall design appears standard and safe, focused solely on establishing network connections via SOCKS proxies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and safe, serving as a utility for proxy-based network connections. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The implementation follows standard practices for handling proxy URLs and socket connections. It does not exhibit obfuscation or malware characteristics.",
