  "purpose": "Utility functions for establishing SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy connections asynchronously, including URL parsing and connection management.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL input, host and port parameters, external URL parsing via 'yarl', user credentials in URL.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted proxy URL components, host and port parameters used in socket connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy URL, host, port) are parsed and validated, then used to create socket wrappers which connect to target hosts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Standard URL parsing and socket creation procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard asynchronous SOCKS proxy connection setup, with proper validation and exception handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External inputs (proxy URLs) could be crafted maliciously, but this is typical for proxy configuration. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for proxy connections with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score appropriately reflects potential misuse of external inputs but does not indicate inherent danger.",
