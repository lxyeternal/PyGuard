{
  "purpose": "Implements a proxy connector for aiohttp supporting various proxy types with optional DNS resolution and authentication.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for proxy URL construction, external helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`), and network connection points.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection establishment, proxy URL usage in network requests, and socket wrapping for non-HTTP proxies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → proxy URL construction → socket creation/wrapping → connection setup via `_wrap_create_connection` → request proxy update in `connect` method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Reliance on external helpers without their code is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector, with proper handling of proxy URL formation, connection wrapping, and optional DNS resolution. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The external helper functions are a potential vector if malicious, but within this fragment, their usage appears benign. The security and malware scores are consistent with the straightforward, transparent nature of the code. The low risk score reflects minimal security concerns, primarily depending on the trustworthiness of external helpers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, clear, and free of malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
