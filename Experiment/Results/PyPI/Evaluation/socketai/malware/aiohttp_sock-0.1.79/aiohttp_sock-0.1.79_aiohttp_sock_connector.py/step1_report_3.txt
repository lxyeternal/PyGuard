  "purpose": "Defines custom proxy connection handling for aiohttp, including no-resolver and proxy URL management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as host, port, username, password, and URL in from_url method, and environment variables if used externally.",
  "sinks": "Proxy URL generation, socket creation, and connection establishment.",
  "flows": "Input data (host, port, credentials, URL) → proxy_url property and from_url method → socket connection or proxy setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated or suspicious code; straightforward logic; relies on external helpers.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages proxy connection setup using provided parameters and URL parsing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. It handles proxy configuration and socket creation securely, with no hardcoded secrets or covert operations. No anomalous or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code handles proxy connections securely and transparently without any indication of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard implementation of proxy handling for aiohttp with no malicious behavior.",
