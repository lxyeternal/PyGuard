  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard aiohttp proxy connector, with no malicious behavior detected. The resolve method is a stub, proxy URL is constructed dynamically, and socket wrapping is used for non-HTTP proxies.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — consistent with the findings.\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the code's nature. The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on external helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) which are not provided. No malicious behavior is evident, but reliance on external code could be a concern.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malware. The risk score remains low, as the code appears standard. The reliance on external helpers is noted but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on proxy connection setup, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate. No malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on standard proxy handling, no malicious activity. External helper functions are used but seem benign.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues identified. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard proxy connector with support for various proxy types, no suspicious code or behavior. External functions are used but appear legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration present.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, indicating code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of an aiohttp proxy connector with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n- The reliance on external helper functions (`create_socket_wrapper`, `parse_proxy_url`) warrants caution, but based on the provided code, they seem to perform typical functions.\n\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, but with some reliance on external functions)\n\n**In conclusion, the code is secure, legitimate, and free of malware.**",
