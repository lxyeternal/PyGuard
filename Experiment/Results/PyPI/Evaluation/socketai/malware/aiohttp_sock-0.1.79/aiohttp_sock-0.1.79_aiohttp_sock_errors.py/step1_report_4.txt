  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to SOCKS proxy errors and general proxy errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; only class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no functions, no data processing, or external calls. The classes serve to categorize errors related to SOCKS proxy operations. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for handling SOCKS proxy errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security issues. The code appears safe and typical for error handling in network-related modules.",
