  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and adheres to standard Python practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified or claimed.\n   - The summaries appropriately emphasize the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely exception class definitions with no malicious activity, a high risk score isn't justified.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.1 (implied) are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's structure and purpose.\n   - No false positives or overestimations are evident.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) across reports is justified.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely for error handling, with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No modifications are needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
