{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions do not process external data",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling; only exception class declarations",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs, as these are simple class definitions for exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for SOCKS proxy errors, inheriting from standard Python exceptions. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or network interactions. The classes serve as error types, which is a common pattern in Python for handling specific error conditions. The structure and content appear straightforward and typical for error handling modules, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The lack of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns indicates no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a simple, safe, and legitimate part of a larger codebase.",
