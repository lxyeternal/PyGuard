{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data flow targets present; no data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only establishes exception class hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues. There are no external data inputs, data processing, or control flow logic. No indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The structure follows standard Python exception subclassing, with clear inheritance hierarchies. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for exception handling and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for SOCKS proxy error management.",
