  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward declaration of custom exception classes for SOCKS protocol errors and connection issues. There are no data input/output operations, no external interactions, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The code appears benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a set of class definitions with no suspicious patterns or security concerns. No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable since the code only defines exceptions.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \nSince all reports assign 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is purely definitional, there is no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \nThe malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there is no malicious activity or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign and typical for error handling.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, I agree with the assigned scores. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The code serves as a standard, benign utility component for error handling in a SOCKS proxy context.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
