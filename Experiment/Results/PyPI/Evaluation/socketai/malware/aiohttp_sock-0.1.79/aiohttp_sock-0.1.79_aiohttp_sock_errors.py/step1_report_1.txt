  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS protocol errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; code is purely declarative with class inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. The code consists solely of exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes for SOCKS protocol errors and connection issues, inheriting from base exception classes. There are no data input sources, no data processing, and no external interactions or side effects. The structure appears standard and focused on error handling within a network application. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of custom exceptions intended for use in SOCKS proxy error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation present. It is a benign utility code component.",
