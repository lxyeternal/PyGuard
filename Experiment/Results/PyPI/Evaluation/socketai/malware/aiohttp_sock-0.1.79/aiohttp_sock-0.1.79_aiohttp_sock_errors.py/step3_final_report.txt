  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exception types; no data input/output or external interactions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class declarations with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for various SOCKS proxy error types, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign, standard nature of the code. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in SOCKS proxy implementations. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
