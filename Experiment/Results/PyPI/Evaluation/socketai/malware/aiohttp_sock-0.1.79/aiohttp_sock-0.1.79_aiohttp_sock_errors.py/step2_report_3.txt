  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - All reports confirm that the code contains only class declarations with no data processing, external interactions, or malicious code.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the summaries or conclusions.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely for exception handling with no malicious or suspicious activity, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions; all are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's benign and straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- While the code itself is safe, in a real-world scenario, the context in which these exception classes are used could introduce risks if, for example, the larger codebase mishandles exceptions or introduces vulnerabilities elsewhere. However, based solely on this snippet, no such issues are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the current evaluation is accurate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
