  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and connection issues.\n   - All reports confirm that there are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign utility component for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign and safe is well-supported.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis that the code is benign and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, indicating no security risk.\n   - Given the nature of the code (simple exception class definitions), this is appropriate.\n   - No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n   - This score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for SOCKS proxy error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
