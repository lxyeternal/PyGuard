  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various SOCKS proxy and connection errors",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; class definitions only",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, no external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class declarations and inheritance structures",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exception classes. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The classes are straightforward and serve as custom error types for SOCKS proxy operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project, but on its own, it is benign.",
