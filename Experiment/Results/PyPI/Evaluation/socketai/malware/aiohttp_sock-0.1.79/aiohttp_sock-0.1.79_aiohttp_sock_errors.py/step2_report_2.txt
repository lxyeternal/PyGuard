  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Issues Present**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to SOCKS proxy errors.\n   - There are no data input/output operations, network interactions, or any executable logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The code appears standard and benign, serving as a utility for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious or security-related issues.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the code contains only exception class definitions with no executable or network code, the risk scores are correctly set to zero.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n   - Therefore, no adjustment needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or payload.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they simply state the code's purpose and benign nature.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (Confirmed benign, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (Code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (No security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe, clear, and intended solely for error handling.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **securityRisk = 0**.",
