  "purpose": "Import the 'color' object or module from the 'colorfade' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from an external package 'colorfade'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this snippet; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the import statement itself; the code is minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement from an external package. It does not execute any logic, handle user input, or process data. Without additional code, there is no indication of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The package 'colorfade' is a known open-source library for color manipulation, which in itself is not malicious. No embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal import statement alone does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate import of a color manipulation module. No malware or security concerns are detected based solely on this code.",
