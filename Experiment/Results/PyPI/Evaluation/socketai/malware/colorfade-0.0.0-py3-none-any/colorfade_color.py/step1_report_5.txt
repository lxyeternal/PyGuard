{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from a user's system, particularly targeting browsers, Discord, Steam, and other applications, then exfiltrate this data to remote servers. It also includes capabilities to zip and upload files from specified directories.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, local files (browser storage, login data, cookies, local state), network requests to IP and geolocation services, and reading user directories for files with keywords indicating sensitive info.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (Pastebin, Gofile, Discord webhook). It writes to files locally and uploads data files to remote servers. It also executes system commands to terminate processes and manipulate files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system files and environment variables into in-memory variables; sensitive data is decrypted or extracted; then it is formatted into payloads and sent over the network to external servers. Specific flows include token extraction from logs, password retrieval from browser databases, cookie collection, and file uploads.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include aggressive process termination (`taskkill`), extensive collection of browser and application data, repeated network requests to external servers, inclusion of potentially malicious file uploads, and presence of hardcoded URLs and tokens. The code also attempts to gather system info and user details without user consent. Certain suspicious patterns are present such as token regex extraction, token validation, and token-based API calls, indicating credential theft intent. The code has redundant imports, unexplained variable uses, and complex multi-threaded file operations which can be used to obfuscate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple malicious activities: it harvests tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from browsers and applications; decrypts encrypted credentials; sends this data to external URLs; kills processes associated with cryptocurrency wallets and browsers; compresses and uploads files from user directories; and runs network requests to geolocation and token validation endpoints. The presence of functions like 'upl05dT4k31', 'uploadToAnonfiles', and extensive file manipulations further suggest data exfiltration. The code also includes mechanisms for stealth, such as process termination and multiple threading, as well as redundant imports and possibly obfuscated code patterns. The overall intent is clearly malicious, aimed at stealing user credentials, tokens, and files without consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious. It functions as a comprehensive information stealer targeting browser data, tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. It exfiltrates this data to external servers, terminates processes to avoid detection, and manipulates user files, indicative of a cybercrime payload designed for credential theft and data exfiltration. The high level of data collection, external communication, process termination, and file uploads confirms malicious intent with a very high security risk.",
