{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious data stealer targeting sensitive user information such as tokens, cookies, passwords, files, and other personal data from various browsers, applications, and installed programs, then uploads this data to remote servers for malicious use.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from local files (browser databases, local state files, logs, configuration files), environment variables, and network responses. It also reads from specific directories associated with browsers, Discord, Steam, Riot, and other applications.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to external servers via HTTP POST requests, particularly through requests to 'https://gofile.io', 'https://transfer.sh', and other URLs, often embedding sensitive information in the payloads. The code also executes system commands to terminate processes and compresses files for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files flow from local sources (browsers, applications) into in-memory variables and are then uploaded through HTTP requests to external servers. Specific functions extract tokens, credentials, and files, which are then assembled into data packets sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes hardcoded URLs, potentially suspicious request patterns, multiple obfuscation-like practices (e.g., variable names, code structure). It terminates processes forcibly, creates zip files of user data, and uploads to remote servers. The presence of extensive token extraction, browser data access, and data exfiltration routines is indicative of malicious intent. The code also collects and uploads Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and files without user consent, with functions that suggest active sabotage or theft.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured to collect a wide array of sensitive user data from browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, Discord, Telegram, Steam, Riot, etc.) and applications (wallets, Steam, Riot Client, etc.). It reads cookies, passwords, tokens, and files, then zips and uploads this data to remote servers. It also searches directories for specific keywords and files, then exfiltrates them. The code kills processes, manages threads for concurrent data collection, and handles network communication with obfuscated or disguised URLs. The logic indicates an intention to stealthily gather credentials and personal info, then transfer it to attacker-controlled endpoints, with minimal regard for user privacy or consent. The use of process termination, process injection, and file compression routines are typical of malware designed for active system sabotage and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a comprehensive information stealer targeting browser data, tokens, credentials, files, and system information. It exfiltrates this data to external servers, actively terminates security-related processes, and searches user directories for sensitive files. Its structure and functions strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at compromising user privacy and security.",
