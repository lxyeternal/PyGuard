{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential, token, cookie, and file stealer. It extracts sensitive data from browsers, applications, and directories, decrypts stored credentials, and exfiltrates this information via network requests and uploads to external servers. It also terminates processes, zips files, and uploads them, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Browsers' local storage and leveldb databases, log files, environment variables, user directories, local state files, and log files from applications like Chrome, Edge, Discord, Steam, and other directories specified in the code.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external URLs (Pastebin, Gofile, Discord webhooks, anonfiles), HTTP POST requests, file uploads, process termination commands, and creation of zip archives for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code reads local files, decrypts stored credentials using Windows Data Protection API and AES, extracts tokens and cookies via regex, then transmits or uploads this data over the network. It also terminates processes, zips files, and uploads them to external servers, following a data collection and exfiltration pipeline.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal obfuscation; the code employs regex, threading, process termination commands, and hardcoded URLs. It performs extensive data collection routines, decrypts credentials, and actively kills processes to evade detection. It also uses multiple network routines and process manipulations, indicating stealth tactics.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive malware designed for credential theft and data exfiltration. It accesses browser and application data, decrypts stored secrets, extracts tokens, cookies, passwords, and files, then exfiltrates this data via HTTP requests and uploads. It terminates processes related to browsers and wallets to access data more effectively. The code employs threading, regex, and process killing to evade detection and increase efficiency. Obfuscation is minimal, mainly regex and variable naming. The overall behavior aligns with known credential-stealing malware, with active data collection, decryption, and exfiltration routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious credential and data stealer, actively extracting sensitive user information from browsers and applications, decrypting stored credentials, and exfiltrating data to external servers. It employs process termination and threading to evade detection, with minimal obfuscation. The activity is consistent with high-severity malware designed for system compromise and data theft.",
