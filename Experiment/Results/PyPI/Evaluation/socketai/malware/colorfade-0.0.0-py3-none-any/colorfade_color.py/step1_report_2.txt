{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious data stealer targeting browser data, credentials, cookies, and files from user directories, then exfiltrates this data via web requests to external servers. It also includes functions for gathering tokens, passwords, cookies, and sensitive files from various applications and browsers.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local files (browser databases, cookies, local state files), user input from logs, and network responses. Specifically, it reads cookies, passwords, tokens, local storage, and other sensitive data from browser directories, application data, and user directories.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST requests to external servers (pastebin, gofile.io, discord webhook), uploads files, and exfiltrates tokens, cookies, passwords, and files. The code also kills processes like browsers and wallets to access files while they are open.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, environment variables, logs, network responses) are read and parsed; data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files are collected; then these are transmitted via HTTP requests or uploaded to file hosts, often with minimal validation or encryption.",
  "anomalies": "Includes obfuscated and intentionally confusing code structures, redundant imports, and multiple functions for exfiltrating data to various external services. Contains hardcoded URLs, aggressive process termination commands, and data collection from multiple browsers, wallets, and applications. Also, uses threading to gather data concurrently, typical of malware designed for speed and stealth.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord, wallets, and other applications. It extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and local files, then uploads or sends them to external servers. It kills related processes to access files locked by running applications. The code structure is complex, with repeated imports and functions, and uses obfuscated variable names, indicating malicious intent. It leverages external services for data exfiltration, such as requests to pastebin, gofile, and Discord webhooks. The presence of functions to steal browser data, tokens, and files strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious malware designed to steal user credentials, cookies, tokens, and files from browsers and applications, then exfiltrate this data to external servers. It employs obfuscation and process termination tactics to evade detection and maximize data collection efficiency. The overall purpose aligns with a data-stealing trojan, posing high security risk.",
