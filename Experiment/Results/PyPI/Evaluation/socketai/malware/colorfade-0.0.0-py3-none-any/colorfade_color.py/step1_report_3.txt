{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, applications, and directories on a compromised system, then uploading this data to external servers, likely without user consent.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local files (e.g., browser storage, login data, cookies), system directories, and network responses; captures tokens, passwords, cookies, geolocation info, and user data.",
  "sinks": "Uploads data via HTTP POST requests to external URLs, including Discord webhooks and anonymous file hosting services; executes system commands to terminate processes and create zip archives of targeted files.",
  "flows": "Sources (local files, environment variables, network responses) feed into extraction and decoding functions, then data flows to network upload functions (`uploadToAnonfiles`, `L04durl1b`, `upload`) which send the collected sensitive information to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated and concatenated regex patterns, executes system commands to kill processes, repeatedly accesses sensitive directories and files, and uploads potentially large data sets; functions like `GatherZips` and `ZipTelegram` archive and send files without clear user knowledge.",
  "analysis": "The code extensively searches for tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from browsers and applications. It employs threading for concurrent operations, decrypts stored credentials, and uploads the collected data to external endpoints. The presence of URL requests to Pastebin, Gofile, and anonymous file hosts, along with process termination commands and the collection of user info (IP, geolocation), suggests malicious intent. The code’s structure, use of obfuscation techniques, and systematic targeting of user data indicate it functions as a stealer or spyware, designed for system compromise and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a highly suspicious data stealer, collecting a wide range of user credentials and files, then uploading them to external servers. It exhibits multiple malicious behaviors, including process termination, data extraction from browsers, and stealthy file archiving, strongly indicating malicious intent and high security risk.",
