{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, applications, and directories on a Windows system, then upload the collected data to a remote server or file hosting service. It also gathers system information and can perform zip operations on targeted files and directories.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser login databases, cookies, local storage files, environment variables, user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), and log files within specific application directories.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (Pastebin, Gofile, Discord webhook), often containing sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, or file links. Files are uploaded to file hosting services like gofile.io.",
  "flows": "The code reads sensitive data from local browser databases, environment variables, and user directories, then processes, encodes/decrypts, and uploads this data through network requests, often bypassing user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated/deceptive code (e.g., multiple regex patterns, cryptographic functions, threading without clear purpose), redundant imports, multiple requests to external IP geolocation and pastebin, functions that collect and exfiltrate tokens/passwords/cookies/files, and launching background threads for data collection and zipping are suspicious. The code also kills processes (e.g., browsers, wallets) to access data, and the presence of hardcoded URLs and tokens indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive data theft activities by extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, and local files from browsers and applications. It decrypts encrypted credentials using Windows' CryptUnprotectData API and Chrome-specific decryption. It collects Discord account information, friends, billing info, and tokens via API requests. The code also searches user directories for files containing sensitive info, uploads collected data to external servers, and zips files for exfiltration. It employs threading for concurrent data collection, kills processes to access data, and uses obfuscation techniques. The overall structure aligns with typical credential-stealing malware, with deliberate data exfiltration mechanisms embedded within functions. There are no signs of malicious system modification beyond data collection, but the activity is highly invasive and unauthorized.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent as a credential and data stealer, targeting browser credentials, tokens, cookies, files, and system information, then exfiltrating this data via external requests. Its design aligns with typical malware behavior, and it does not serve legitimate or benign purposes. It should be considered highly dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
