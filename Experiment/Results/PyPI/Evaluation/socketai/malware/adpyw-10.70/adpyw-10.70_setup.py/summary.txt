  "conclusion": "The setup script executes an obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell command during installation, with silent, hidden execution and error suppression. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious activity, warranting caution. The high scores assigned are appropriate, and further decoding of the command is recommended to confirm intent. Until then, treat the package as potentially malicious."
