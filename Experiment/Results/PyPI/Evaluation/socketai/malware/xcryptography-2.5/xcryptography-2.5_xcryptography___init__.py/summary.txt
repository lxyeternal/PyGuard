  "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, employing encoding, DNS queries, and HTTP requests to transmit system information without user consent. While it lacks destructive payloads, its behavior is characteristic of malicious exfiltration malware. The suspicion level is high, and it should be flagged for further investigation."
