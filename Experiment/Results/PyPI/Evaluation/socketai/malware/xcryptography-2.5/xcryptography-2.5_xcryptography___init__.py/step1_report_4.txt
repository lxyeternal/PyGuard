  "flows": "Collect system info -> encode and split data -> send via ICMP ping to DNS domain -> send via HTTP POST/GET to content domain",
  "anomalies": "Use of ping with encoded data embedded in domain name, multiple network request methods, obfuscated data encoding, possibly covert data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and package info, encodes this data in base64, splits into parts, and transmits via ICMP ping requests by encoding data in domain names. Additionally, it sends the same data via HTTP POST and GET requests using different modules, with multiple try-except blocks to handle failures. The data encoding and transmission methods suggest an attempt to hide data exfiltration within normal network traffic. Use of ICMP pings with data embedded in domain names and multiple HTTP methods indicates malicious intent, likely to evade detection. No benign functionality or legitimate purpose appears evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code covertly gathers system info, encodes it, and exfiltrates it through ICMP and HTTP channels, indicating malicious behavior designed for data exfiltration. It does not perform any legitimate function and employs obfuscation techniques. High maliciousness score and security risk. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
