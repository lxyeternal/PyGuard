  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'xcryptography' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, packages) from the code itself.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, straightforward setup usage.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a package with a name and version, and automatically finds all sub-packages. It performs a standard package setup process without any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious constructs. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
