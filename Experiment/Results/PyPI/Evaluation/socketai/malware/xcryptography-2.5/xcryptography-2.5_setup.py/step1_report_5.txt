{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'xcryptography' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports and executes setup functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely invokes package setup functions.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'xcryptography' is similar to 'cryptography', which could be suspicious if intended for mimicking a legitimate package, but alone it is not conclusive. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from 'setuptools' and executes a setup function with predefined package name and version. It is a standard package setup script with minimal code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the package name, which could be intended to mislead, but this is speculative without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project named 'xcryptography'. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this code snippet.",
