  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'xcryptography' Python module.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools for package setup and finding packages within the current directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, user inputs, or data sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup process is standard and static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-standard package name 'xcryptography' which may be a benign package or potentially misleading; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, defines package name and version, and finds packages automatically. There are no dynamic evaluations, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. It appears to be a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues are present based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package named 'xcryptography'. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The package name could potentially be designed to mimic a legitimate cryptography package, but there is no evidence of malicious intent within this code snippet.",
