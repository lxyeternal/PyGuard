  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for packaging a Python project named 'xcryptography'.",
  "sources": "Static import of setuptools functions; static arguments in setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processed",
  "flows": "None; setup() is called with fixed parameters, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'xcryptography' resembles 'cryptography', potentially misleading, but no malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The only concern is the package name similarity, which could be used for typosquatting, but the code itself shows no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity. The package name similarity is a potential supply chain concern but not reflected in the code content. Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero.",
