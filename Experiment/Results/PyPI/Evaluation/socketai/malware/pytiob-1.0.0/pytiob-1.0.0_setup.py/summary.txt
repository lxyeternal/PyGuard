  "conclusion": "The code exhibits classic signs of malicious behavior: encrypted payload, obfuscation, runtime decryption and execution, and conditional behavior on Windows. These factors pose a high security risk, and the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious until further analysis of the decrypted payload confirms benignity."
