  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'splitmask' with additional obfuscated subprocess call.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen command that executes a PowerShell encoded command, and the os.path.exists check.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call potentially executes hidden PowerShell commands; the os.path.exists check reads the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check (source) potentially triggers the subprocess (sink) if condition is met, executing encoded PowerShell.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell command; use of try-except blocks suppressing errors; running subprocess with no window.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities and attempts to run a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 if the file 'tahg' does not exist. The subprocess call is obfuscated and could execute malicious or undesired code without user awareness. The setup function itself appears normal for package distribution. The try-except blocks suppress errors, preventing detection of issues. The encoded PowerShell command could potentially perform malicious actions, such as data exfiltration or system modification, depending on what the decoded command does. Overall, the primary suspicious element is the obfuscated subprocess execution which is hidden and conditionally triggered.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command execution that is conditionally triggered, indicating malicious intent or sabotage potential. The setup process itself is standard but the embedded encoded command warrants suspicion due to its obfuscation and hidden execution.",
