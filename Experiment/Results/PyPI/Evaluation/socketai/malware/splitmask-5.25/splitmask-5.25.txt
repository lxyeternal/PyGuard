      "conclusion": "The setup script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity or backdoor. The code's behavior warrants thorough decoding and analysis before deployment. The high obfuscation and silent execution patterns are red flags, and the package should be scrutinized or rejected until the payload is verified safe."
