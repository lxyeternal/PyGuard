{
  "purpose": "Import the 'main' function from the 'utilitytools.run' module, likely to execute or utilize it later in the script.",
  "sources": "Import statement from utilitytools.run",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; only an import statement without execution",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context; only an import statement, no execution or data handling shown. Potential for misuse depends on how 'main' is used elsewhere, but not evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement bringing in 'main' from 'utilitytools.run'. This by itself does not perform any malicious action. Without additional code invoking 'main' or manipulating data, there are no evident security concerns. The module 'utilitytools.run' could be benign or malicious, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with no immediate malicious behavior. No suspicious activity or malware indications are present based solely on this snippet. The security risk is low, but further context could reveal more.",
