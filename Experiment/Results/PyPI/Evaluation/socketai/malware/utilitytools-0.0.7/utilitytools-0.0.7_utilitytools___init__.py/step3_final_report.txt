  "purpose": "To assess whether the import statement indicates malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from utilitytools.run, potentially leading to execution of 'main'.",
  "sinks": "Potential invocation of 'main' which could execute malicious code if called elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' from 'utilitytools.run' with possible future invocation leading to execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports 'main' from 'utilitytools.run' without invocation or data handling. The security risk depends entirely on what 'main' does when called. The import alone is benign; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. Scores are set to reflect the minimal risk, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) to account for potential malicious behavior if 'main' is invoked and malicious. Confidence is high that the code is benign in isolation, but uncertainty remains about 'main's implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign as presented. The risk of malicious activity is minimal unless 'main' is malicious when invoked. Scores are appropriate; no changes necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
