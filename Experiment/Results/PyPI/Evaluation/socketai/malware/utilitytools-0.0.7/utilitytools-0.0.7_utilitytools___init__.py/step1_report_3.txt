{
  "purpose": "Import the main function from the utilitytools.run module, likely to execute or call it later.",
  "sources": "The import statement; no input or data reading occurs in this line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that affect data flow.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow is visible beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink flow occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident; the code is minimal and straightforward with standard import syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a module without executing it or including any other logic. Since there are no runtime behaviors, data handling, or malicious code, it presents no security concerns by itself. It is a common pattern in Python scripts or modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior. It only imports a function, and no suspicious activity is apparent.",
