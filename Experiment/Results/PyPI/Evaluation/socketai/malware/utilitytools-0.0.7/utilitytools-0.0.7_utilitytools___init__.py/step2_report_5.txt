  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly states that the code only imports 'main' and does not execute it. No malicious behavior is evident from the import alone.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report emphasizes reliance on the implementation of 'main', which is appropriate. No logical flaws.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are both 0, which is reasonable given the minimal code. Security risk is low (0.2), which seems appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores:** Since only an import is shown, the risk is minimal unless 'main' performs malicious actions when invoked. The confidence score is 0.3, reflecting uncertainty.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to report 1, only an import is shown; no execution or data flow is demonstrated.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes that the actual behavior depends on 'main'.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is consistent.\n- **Justification:** Without evidence of execution or malicious code, scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is cautious but accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is just an import; no execution or malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly identifies that there's no immediate risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, and security risk is 0.\n- **Justification:** Fully justified given the minimal code.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only an import statement.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is low.\n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, only an import, no execution.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues; the reasoning aligns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is minimal.\n- **Justification:** Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Sound.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is minimal and only involves an import statement.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriately low across all reports.\n- The confidence scores vary but generally reflect the uncertainty inherent in only seeing an import statement.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Given the minimal code, the malware score should remain at 0 unless there is external evidence that 'utilitytools.run.main' performs malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Since no obfuscation is evident, it should stay at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay low (around 0.1 to 0.2), unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2\n\n**Summary:** The code snippet is benign on its own. The potential risk hinges entirely on what 'main' does when invoked, which cannot be assessed from this import statement alone. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.",
