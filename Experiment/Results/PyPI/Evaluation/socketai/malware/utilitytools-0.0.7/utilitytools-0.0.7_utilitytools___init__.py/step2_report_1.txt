  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code only imports 'main' from 'utilitytools.run'. There is no evidence of execution or malicious behavior in this snippet.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes the lack of context and that the behavior depends on 'main'. No logical flaws.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which seems appropriate. Security risk is low (0.2), which is reasonable given the potential for 'main' to do harmful things upon invocation.  \n- **Justification:** Since 'main' could perform malicious actions when called, a security risk score of 0.2 is acceptable. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate as no malicious activity is evident here.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only an import, with no evidence of execution or malicious intent.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly emphasizes that risk depends on 'main's implementation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.2, consistent with potential risk if 'main' is malicious.  \n- **Justification:** The cautious security risk score of 0.2 is justified, given the unknown behavior of 'main'.  \n- **Conclusion:** The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Minimal code, only an import. No malicious activity or anomalies.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly states the benign nature.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0, appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity; scores are accurate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; import only, no execution or data handling.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report is accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.1, which is acceptable for a benign import statement.  \n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only an import, no execution.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly states the benign nature.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code snippet is just an import statement with no immediate malicious activity. The security risk scores are cautiously set, reflecting the potential risk if 'main' is invoked and contains malicious code, which is reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0, since there's no evidence of malicious code in the snippet.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1, considering that invoking 'main' could be risky if 'main' is malicious, but the import alone is benign.\n\n**Final notes:**  \n- The current scores are appropriate given the limited context.  \n- If further code shows 'main()' being called, the risk score should be increased accordingly.  \n- The malware score remains at 0 unless evidence of malicious activity is provided.",
