  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether the code indeed exhibits malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code behavior:**\n\n- The setup script defines a function `notmalfunc()` that:\n  - Downloads an executable (`pics.exe`) from a hardcoded URL.\n  - Saves it locally.\n  - Executes it via `subprocess.Popen` during the package installation process (`AfterInstall` class).\n\n- The code contains an unused `b64d()` function, possibly for obfuscation, but it's not utilized here.\n\n- The malicious activity occurs during the `install` phase, triggered by `notmalfunc()`.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n**Confirmed:**\n- The code does download an executable from an external URL during package installation.\n- It then runs this executable without validation.\n- This is suspicious and potentially malicious.\n\n**Not present:**\n- No obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward.\n- No other malicious code besides the download and execution.\n\n**Note:** The `b64d()` function is unused, so no obfuscation is applied here.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the download and execution of external code during setup.\n- They recognize this as malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No report claims the code is benign; all see high risk.\n\n**Minor point:**\n- Some reports mention \"potential vulnerabilities\" or \"assumptions\" but ultimately recognize the malicious intent based on observed behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.9 or 1.0, which is appropriate given the behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** Similarly high, consistent with malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All report 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 0.9 or 1, justified by the clear malicious behavior.\n\n**Suggestion:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n- Downloading and executing arbitrary code during package installation is **extremely risky**.\n- It can lead to remote code execution, malware infection, system compromise.\n- The activity is deliberate and malicious, justifying high scores.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n\n- The code downloads and runs an executable from an external source without validation.\n- This is a classic supply chain attack vector.\n- The malware score of 1 or 0.9 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- All reports base their conclusions on the observed behavior: download + execute during setup.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are evident; behavior is suspicious and dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the behavior described.\n- High malware and security risk scores are justified.\n- Obfuscation is correctly marked as absent.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimation**\n\n- The code **definitely** exhibits malicious behavior: remote code download and execution during setup.\n- **Malware score:** **1.0** (full malicious activity).\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation).\n- **Risk score:** **1.0** (highest, due to the potential for system compromise).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate in identifying the malicious activity. The scores are appropriate and justified. The code clearly demonstrates a supply chain attack vector by executing remote code during installation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type     | My Estimate |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | **1.0**     |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**       |\n| Risk           | **1.0**     |\n\nThis package, as described, is **malicious** and should be flagged accordingly.",
