{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that installs utility tools, with additional code to download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads a URL string ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe') and requests data from it. It also reads environment variables indirectly through the requests library if used elsewhere, and the code attempts to access the file system to save and execute the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes a file ('pics.exe') to disk and then executes it via subprocess.Popen, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the downloaded file is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves: 1) URL string as a source, 2) HTTP response content as data, 3) saving this content as 'pics.exe', 4) executing 'pics.exe' using subprocess.Popen.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the automatic download and execution of an external executable during the package installation process, which is highly suspicious and not typical for a setup script. The use of base64 decoding function is not utilized in this code but may be intended to obfuscate code or data. The code bypasses normal package installation practices by executing arbitrary code from the internet.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a setup configuration for a Python package, but it contains embedded malicious behavior: during the 'install' command, it downloads an executable from a remote URL and runs it, which could execute arbitrary malicious code. The presence of a base64 decoding function hints at potential obfuscation, though unused here. The code does not perform any validation or verification of the downloaded executable, making it a serious security risk. This behavior constitutes a supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution upon package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, representing a significant security threat. This behavior is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious, as it can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or malware installation. The overall security risk score is high, and confidence is complete based on observed behavior.",
