{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration, including custom install and develop commands that execute a function potentially downloading and running an external executable.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) during the execution of notmalfunc(), triggered by the install command.",
  "sinks": "The download_file() function writes an external file to the local system, and run_exe() attempts to execute this downloaded file, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the downloaded file is malicious.",
  "flows": "The setup process invokes the custom install command, which calls notmalfunc(). This function downloads an executable from a remote source and executes it, creating a source-to-sink flow where external data (the executable) is downloaded and then executed.",
  "anomalies": "The notmalfunc() function downloads an executable from a remote URL and immediately attempts to execute it during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior in a setup script. The URL points to an .exe file, which is platform-specific and potentially malicious. Additionally, the function is embedded within the setup script, which is not typical or safe.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the setuptools package to define a setup configuration. However, it includes a function notmalfunc() that downloads an executable file from an external source and executes it during the installation process. This behavior is highly suspicious as it can lead to remote code execution on the host system. The function is called in the custom install command, meaning any user installing this package unknowingly executes potentially malicious code. The code also contains a base64 decoding function but does not use it. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard, but the malicious behavior in notmalfunc() significantly raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes code that downloads and executes an external executable during installation, representing a high security risk and malicious intent. This behavior is unusual and potentially harmful, indicating the package may be used for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or malware distribution.",
