{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'utilitytools' that installs dependencies and defines custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "URL to download an executable from the internet, environment variables (none explicitly used), package data.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an external executable file from a remote URL, subprocess.Popen to run the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'notmalfunc' function downloads a file from a hardcoded URL and attempts to execute it, creating a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of code that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation; use of subprocess.Popen to run downloaded file; no validation or sandboxing; URL is hardcoded; potential command execution; no security checks or validation on downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, but includes a function 'notmalfunc' that fetches an executable from a remote URL and runs it, which is highly suspicious. This behavior occurs during the installation process via the 'AfterInstall' class. The download is performed using requests, and the executable is executed using subprocess.Popen without validation, making it a significant security concern. The rest of the code appears typical for a setup script with no other suspicious activity or obfuscation. The inclusion of remote code execution during installation strongly suggests malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external file during package installation, which is highly suspicious and dangerous. This indicates potential malware or backdoor functionality embedded within the package setup process.",
