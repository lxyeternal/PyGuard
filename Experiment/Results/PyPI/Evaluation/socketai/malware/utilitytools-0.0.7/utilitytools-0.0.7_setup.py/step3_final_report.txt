{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes an external executable during package installation, potentially malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe' is used as the source for the executable download.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable 'pics.exe' is saved locally and run via subprocess.Popen, executing arbitrary code on the system.",
  "flows": "The code fetches the executable from the URL, saves it as 'pics.exe', and then executes it directly, establishing a source-to-sink flow of untrusted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unused 'b64d' function (base64 decoding) which may suggest obfuscation or leftover code; the direct download and execution during setup is highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package 'utilitytools'. It includes a function 'notmalfunc()' that downloads an executable from a hardcoded URL and runs it during installation via a custom 'AfterInstall' class. The download and execution of external code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. The 'b64d' function is unused, indicating potential red herring or obfuscation, but does not impact the malicious behavior. The code's behavior is straightforward, with no obfuscation or benign purpose. The high severity of executing remote code during setup warrants a malware score of 1, and the security risk score of 1, as it poses an immediate threat of remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, representing a severe supply chain security risk. The behavior is consistent with known malicious patterns, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified. The package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly.",
