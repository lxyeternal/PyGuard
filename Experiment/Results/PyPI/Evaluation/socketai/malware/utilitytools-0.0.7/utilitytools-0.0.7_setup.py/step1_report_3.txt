{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'utilitytools' with some basic utilities, including custom install and develop commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a URL ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe') during the execution of the 'notmalfunc' function.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file ('pics.exe') is executed locally using subprocess.Popen, potentially running malicious code without user consent.",
  "flows": "The function 'notmalfunc' downloads an executable from an external URL, saves it as 'pics.exe', and then executes it, creating a flow from remote URL to local execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of code that downloads and executes an external executable without user interaction or transparency. The URL points to an executable, which is suspicious. The code runs this executable immediately after download, indicative of potential malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a package with metadata and dependencies. However, within the 'notmalfunc' function, it retrieves an executable file from a remote URL and executes it directly, which is a common tactic for malicious payload delivery. This behavior is triggered during the installation process via the 'AfterInstall' class, which runs 'notmalfunc'. The use of requests to fetch a binary and subprocess to execute it are suspicious, especially as they happen during package setup. The rest of the code appears standard for package setup and does not contain any obfuscation or other malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation, which can be used to run arbitrary malicious code on the user's system. This behavior indicates high malicious intent and security risk.",
