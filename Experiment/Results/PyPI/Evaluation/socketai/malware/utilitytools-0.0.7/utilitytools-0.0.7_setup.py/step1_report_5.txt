{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'utilitytools', which includes custom install and develop commands that execute a function to download and run an external executable.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data in the 'notmalfunc' function, specifically fetching a file from a remote URL ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe').",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'subprocess.Popen(exe_path)', which runs the downloaded executable on the host system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the external URL (source) through 'requests.get' to save as 'pics.exe' and then is executed via 'subprocess.Popen'.",
  "anomalies": "The 'notmalfunc' function is embedded within the setup script and is called during installation. It downloads and runs an external executable, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. The base64 decoding function ('b64d') is defined but unused, possibly obfuscation or leftover code, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup configuration for a Python package. However, it contains a function that downloads an executable from an external source and executes it automatically during installation. This behavior can be malicious, as it may run arbitrary code from the internet without user consent. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' to execute the downloaded file is dangerous, as it could run malicious code or malware. The presence of this function within the setup script suggests malicious intent or at least malicious behavior hidden in the package installation process. No other suspicious code or obfuscation is present besides the unused base64 decoder.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior in the form of downloading and executing an external executable during package installation. This is a clear security risk, potentially leading to system compromise. The behavior indicates malicious intent, such as running unauthorized code without user knowledge or consent.",
