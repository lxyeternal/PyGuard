The behavior is consistent with known malicious patterns, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified. The package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly."

The pattern is typical of malware droppers, and the code should be flagged as malicious. No benign explanation or safe use case is evident given the behavior."
