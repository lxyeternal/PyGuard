{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a specified URL and executes it on the local system.",
  "sources": "The URL variable in main() (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe`) which provides the executable content; the `requests.get()` call fetching data; the `download_file()` function writing the file to disk.",
  "sinks": "The `subprocess.Popen()` call which executes the downloaded file (`pics.exe`) on the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL via `requests.get()` into the `download_file()` which writes it to disk. If successful, the `run_exe()` function executes the file via `subprocess.Popen()`, initiating potential malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable without validation, user confirmation, or sandboxing. The URL points to a potentially malicious executable on a public repo; the filename is generic. No checksums, signatures, or safety measures are present. The code runs downloaded code without verification.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves an executable from a remote source and runs it immediately, which is a classic pattern for malware delivery. The URL appears suspicious, hosted on a public repository with a non-descriptive filename. The functions do not include any validation, sandboxing, or safety checks, making it highly risky. The code's simplicity and the direct execution of downloaded content are typical of malicious scripts designed for supply chain attacks or malware distribution. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious code constructs; however, the behavior itself is inherently malicious in typical security contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code automates the download and execution of an external executable without verification, indicating malicious intent and high security risk. It can be used for malware distribution or executing harmful payloads on the host system.",
