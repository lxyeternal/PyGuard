{
  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The URL in the main() function ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe') which is used to download the executable; the download_file() function which reads from this URL; the subprocess.Popen() call which executes the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen(exe_path) which runs the downloaded executable; open(file_path, 'wb') which writes the downloaded content to disk.",
  "flows": "The code fetches data from the URL (source) in download_file(), writes it to a local file (exe_path), and then executes that file via run_exe() using subprocess.Popen().",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable without validation, verification, or user consent. The URL points to a raw executable on GitHub, which could be malicious. No checks for file integrity or security are performed. The code lacks any safeguards or logging.",
  "analysis": "The script downloads an executable from an external URL and runs it immediately, which is a common pattern in malware delivery. The URL is hardcoded, pointing to a specific file on GitHub, which might be malicious. The code does not verify the content, checksum, or authenticity of the downloaded file. The use of subprocess.Popen() without security checks or sandboxing is risky. Overall, the script demonstrates behavior typical of malicious or potentially harmful automation, especially given the context of automatic download and execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable without validation, which can be used for malicious purposes such as executing malware. Given the hardcoded URL pointing to a suspicious executable, the overall risk is high. It should be considered unsafe and potentially malicious.",
