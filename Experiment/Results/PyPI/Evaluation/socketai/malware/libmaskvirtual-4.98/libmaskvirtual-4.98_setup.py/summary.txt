  "conclusion": "The package contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during installation, indicative of malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, reflecting high risk and obfuscation. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity. Until then, the package should be considered potentially malicious and handled accordingly."
