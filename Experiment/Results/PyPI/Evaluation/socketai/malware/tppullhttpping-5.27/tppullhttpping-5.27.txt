      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, indicative of malicious intent. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious actions. Overall, the package poses a significant security threat and should be treated with caution."
