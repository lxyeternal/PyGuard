  "security_risk": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high likelihood of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, indicative of a supply chain attack or malware delivery. The package setup appears benign but is likely a cover for malicious payloads. Scores are justified; treat the package as malicious until further analysis confirms benign behavior."
