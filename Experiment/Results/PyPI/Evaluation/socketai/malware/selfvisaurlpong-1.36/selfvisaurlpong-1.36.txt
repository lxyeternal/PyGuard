      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware. The assigned scores are appropriate, and further decoding and analysis of the payload are recommended before distribution."
