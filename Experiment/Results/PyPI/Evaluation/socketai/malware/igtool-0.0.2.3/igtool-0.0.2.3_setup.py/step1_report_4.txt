{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'igtool', including a custom post-installation step that executes a function 'send' during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs. It also retrieves and executes a file from a remote server using os.system.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs with sensitive information; executing downloaded files with 'os.system' which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The 'send' function reads environment data -> sends data via HTTP request -> downloads a potentially malicious executable -> executes it, potentially compromising the system.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to send system-specific environment data to an external server and then downloads and runs an executable from an untrusted source. The use of 'os.system' with a downloaded file is suspicious. The try-except block suppresses all errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and other modules, then defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It makes a GET request to a domain 'linkedopports.com', which appears suspicious and possibly malicious. If running on Windows ('win32'), it downloads an executable from 'python-release.com' and executes it immediately, which could be malicious. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' runs the 'send' function after installation. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity designed to exfiltrate system info and execute remote code. The code suppresses errors, possibly to avoid detection or errors during execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and downloading and executing arbitrary code from external servers during package installation. These actions pose a significant security risk and suggest malicious intent.",
