{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package named 'igtool' and perform post-installation actions, including sending environment information and downloading/executing a file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, makes HTTP GET requests to specific URLs, and executes a downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing and executing a downloaded file via 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "The 'send' function retrieves 'COMPUTERNAME', sends it via HTTP GET, then downloads and executes a file if on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically executes a downloaded file without validation, sends environment info to external domains, and includes untrusted external URLs that could host malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that captures the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'. It then sends this info to a suspicious URL. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from an external domain and executes it directly, without any verification or user consent. The setup process invokes this 'send' function during installation. The code structure suggests it aims to perform malicious actions post-installation by contacting external servers and executing potentially harmful payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior patterns, including data exfiltration and arbitrary code execution, with no legitimate purpose. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous to run or distribute.",
