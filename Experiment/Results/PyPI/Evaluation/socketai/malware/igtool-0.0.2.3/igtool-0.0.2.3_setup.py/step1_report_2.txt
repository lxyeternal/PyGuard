{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom post-installation step that performs network requests and potentially executes a file.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; fetching URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ' + env; downloading and executing a file from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "Executing downloaded file using os.system; making HTTP GET requests that could be used for tracking or command and control.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL with environment info -> fetch response; fetch file from 'python-release.com' -> save as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe' -> execute via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block without handling exceptions; downloading and executing a script during installation; use of 'start' command on Windows to run an executable; fetching data from suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a potentially malicious domain and executes it immediately. The custom 'PostInstallCommand' runs this 'send' function during package installation, making it a covert post-installation action. The code's structure and actions resemble malware behavior, such as data exfiltration and remote code execution, especially considering the download and execution of a file from untrusted sources without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by retrieving system information, communicating with suspicious external servers, downloading, and executing potentially malicious files during package installation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malware with a high security risk.",
