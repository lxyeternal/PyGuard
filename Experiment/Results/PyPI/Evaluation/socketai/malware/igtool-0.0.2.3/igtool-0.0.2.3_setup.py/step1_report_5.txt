{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with added functionality to send system information and download and execute a file during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs; reads and writes files; executes downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs; writing and executing a potentially malicious executable file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') during installation.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' → HTTP GET request to 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php'; Downloaded content → saved as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe' → executed via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system info to an external URL and automatically downloading and executing an executable file during setup, which is not typical for a legitimate package. The URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' and the executable 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe' are suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and requests, then defines a 'send' function that gathers the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and makes an HTTP request to a suspicious domain. If the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from a questionable URL and executes it. The custom install class runs this 'send' function during package installation. This behavior indicates the script is collecting system info and installing external software without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The URLs and executable names are suspicious, and such activity is not typical or justified in a standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and downloading/executing an external file during installation. It likely aims to compromise or surveil the user's system. The package contains malicious intent, making it highly dangerous.",
