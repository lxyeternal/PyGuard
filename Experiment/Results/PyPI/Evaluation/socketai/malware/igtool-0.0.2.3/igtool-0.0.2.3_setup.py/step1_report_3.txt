{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package with a custom installation command that executes additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('COMPUTERNAME'), makes HTTP GET requests, and downloads/executed a file from an external URL during installation.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, executing downloaded files with 'os.system', and sending data over the network through the 'requests.get' call.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> send() function sending data to external server, then conditionally downloading and executing an executable file from a suspicious domain.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, fetching data from suspicious URLs, and executing downloaded files without validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and requests, and defines a 'send' function that retrieves an environment variable and sends it to a remote server. It also downloads an executable from a questionable URL and attempts to run it silently. The 'PostInstallCommand' class runs 'send' during installation. The setup() function hooks this custom install command. These behaviors indicate active communication with external servers, download of potentially malicious payloads, and execution of arbitrary code without user knowledge or consent. The code exhibits suspicious network activity, unsanitized external file execution, and suppression of errors, all of which are typical malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious intent through external data exfiltration, silent download, and execution of external binaries. It likely constitutes a supply chain attack vector or malware. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
