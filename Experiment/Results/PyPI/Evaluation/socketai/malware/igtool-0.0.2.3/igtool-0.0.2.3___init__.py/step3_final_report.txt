{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function that prints 'installed' and executes it, serving as a basic indicator or log message.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or untrusted data read; static code with no data flow.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause leaks or effects, as the code is purely static and benign.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function call is straightforward with no external data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is clear and trivial.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function definition that prints a static message and is immediately invoked. It contains no external data inputs, no dynamic behavior, and no malicious or suspicious activity. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. Given the absence of external data, data flows, or suspicious constructs, the code poses no security risk or malware threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports accurately assess its benign nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
