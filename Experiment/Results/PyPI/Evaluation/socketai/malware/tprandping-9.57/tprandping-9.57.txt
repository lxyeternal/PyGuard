      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to executing an obfuscated, external URL-referenced PowerShell command during package setup, with techniques typical of malware delivery. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified and should be considered a serious threat."
