      "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed conditionally during setup, indicative of malicious intent. The silent execution and suspicious comment further elevate concern. While the exact payload remains unverified without decoding, the evidence warrants high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The code should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms benign intent."
