  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing obfuscation and hidden execution tactics typical of supply chain compromises. The embedded URL and silent payload execution reinforce malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, warranting immediate removal or quarantine of the package."
