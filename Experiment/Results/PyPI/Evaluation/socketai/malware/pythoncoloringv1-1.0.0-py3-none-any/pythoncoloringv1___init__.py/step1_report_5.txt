{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a malicious information stealer and system attacker, collecting sensitive data such as browser credentials, cookies, tokens, system information, screenshots, and possibly cryptocurrency wallet data, then exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks or uploads to external servers.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., COMUPTERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), filesystem paths (browser data, cookies, history, credit card info, wallet files), process list (checking for debugging or analysis tools), process information (via psutil), clipboard data, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Posts collected data to Discord webhook URLs, uploads files to external servers (anonfiles, transfer.sh), executes system commands (taskkill, pip installs), and writes logs and screenshots to disk before exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables, filesystem, network, clipboard, and process checks; data flows through decryption, parsing, and collection functions; then via HTTP POST requests to webhooks and uploads, with some data also written locally and zipped for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded webhook URLs, repeated pip install commands, extensive browser data extraction, process termination for security tools, system info collection, clipboard manipulation for wallet addresses, and extensive use of obfuscated and random data generation. Also, the code uses deceptive function names and hidden behaviors (e.g., data collection, system sabotage). The use of environment variables for environment detection and specific process killing suggests anti-analysis tactics.",
  "analysis": "The code is highly suspicious, designed to steal user credentials, cookies, tokens, and system info, then exfiltrate via Discord webhooks or upload to third-party sites. It includes mechanisms to detect virtual machines, debuggers, or sandbox environments, and attempts to disable security processes. The code also searches for wallet data and sensitive files across common directories, zips collected data, and reports it externally. The presence of extensive obfuscated patterns, hardcoded URLs, and manipulation of user environment variables indicates malicious intent with potential privacy violations, credential theft, and system sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, acting as a comprehensive info-stealing trojan with anti-debugging, anti-analysis, and data exfiltration capabilities. It attempts to harvest sensitive user data and system info while hiding its activity, which makes it highly dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
