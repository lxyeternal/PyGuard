{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data theft, including extracting credentials, cookies, tokens, browsing history, and system information from a compromised system. It also includes functionalities for uploading collected data to remote servers and controlling browser profiles and processes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, system commands, browser files (like Local State, Login Data, Cookies, History), clipboard data, and process lists. It also reads local configuration files and hardcoded paths for browsers and applications.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (e.g., https://kekwltd.ru/relay/bluescreen), uploaded to file hosting services (transfer.sh, anonfiles), and written to local files. It also captures and exfiltrates system info, tokens, cookies, passwords, and browsing history.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data such as browser credentials, cookies, tokens, clipboard content, and system information is collected from sources, processed/decrypted, and then transmitted to remote servers through HTTP requests or stored locally for later upload. Process control commands (like killing processes) are executed based on system checks.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded webhook URLs, IP addresses, and wallet addresses. Uses obfuscated or misleading variable names and suspicious functions like 'bc_create_file' and 'bc_checking' that search for sensitive files. The code kills security-related processes, extracts browser data, and uploads potentially sensitive files, indicative of malicious intent. The code also forcibly terminates processes like 'chrome.exe' and deletes files, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a complex malicious tool that performs credential theft from browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), extracts cookies, passwords, browsing history, and credit card info. It collects system info (UUID, IP, location, hardware ID) and captures screenshots. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads. It terminates security and debugging processes to evade detection. It searches user directories for files containing sensitive keywords and uploads found files anonymously. The presence of hardcoded URLs, process killing, data exfiltration, and browser data theft strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at unauthorized data collection and system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in nature, designed to steal sensitive user data, system info, and credentials, then exfiltrate it to external servers. It attempts to disable security measures, collect extensive personal and system data, and upload files anonymously. It clearly demonstrates malicious behavior with high risk potential.",
