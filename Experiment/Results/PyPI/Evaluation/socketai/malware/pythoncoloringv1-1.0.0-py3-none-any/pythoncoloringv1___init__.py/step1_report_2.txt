{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for stealing sensitive user data, including cookies, passwords, tokens, and browser information, and exfiltrating it via webhooks or file uploads. It also includes functionalities for process termination, file compression, and file uploads to third-party services, indicating malicious intent to extract and transmit personal information covertly.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from environment variables (e.g., 'COMPUTERNAME', 'LOCALAPPDATA', 'APPDATA', 'TEMP'), browser data directories (Chrome, Opera, Yandex, Brave, etc.), database files ('Login Data', 'Cookies', 'History', 'Web Data'), and clipboard data. It also captures system information via subprocess calls and requests external IP/location data.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to remote webhooks via HTTP POST requests, uploaded to anonymous file sharing services ('transfer.sh', 'transfer.sh'), and saved locally in temp directories. Sensitive data such as cookies, passwords, tokens, credit card info, and user history are exfiltrated and uploaded or sent over network connections.",
  "flows": "Sources include environment variables, browser profile files, clipboard contents, and database entries. These data sources flow into decryption functions (decrypt_val, CryptUnprotectData), which process encrypted data using master keys. Extracted data then flows into functions that prepare and send this data to external webhooks or upload services, often via HTTP POST requests.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded URLs, extensive use of obfuscation patterns (e.g., regex patterns, encrypted key extraction), malicious process termination commands (taskkill), and extensive data exfiltration routines. Multiple suspicious process checks (e.g., for debuggers, virtual machines, or analysis tools), along with stealth techniques like hiding startup entries and disabling protections. Use of unverified external services for data upload and the presence of code designed to bypass user security measures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It begins by installing numerous dependencies, including 'requests' and 'httpx', then performs web requests to external URLs, exfiltrating environment data like username and computer name. It contains modules to extract saved passwords, cookies, browser history, credit card info, and Roblox credentials by decrypting stored browser data. It also captures system info, screenshot images, and user IP data. The code actively terminates known security or analysis processes, modifies browser files, and disables certain protections. The presence of obfuscated regex patterns, encrypted master keys, and indirect process checks indicate an intent to evade detection. Data is aggregated and sent via Discord webhooks or uploaded to anonymous file hosting services, suggesting covert data exfiltration. There is also code to create ZIP archives of stolen files and upload them anonymously. All activities are performed stealthily with minimal user interaction, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, primarily designed for stealthy data theft and exfiltration from infected systems. It targets browser credentials, tokens, cookies, and system information, then transmits these to external servers. The presence of process termination routines, stealth techniques, and data encryption/decryption routines confirms intent to evade detection and facilitate covert operations. Overall, this code should be classified as malware with a high security risk.",
