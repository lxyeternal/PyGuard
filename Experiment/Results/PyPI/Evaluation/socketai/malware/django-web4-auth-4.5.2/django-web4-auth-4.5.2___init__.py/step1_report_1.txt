  "purpose": "Simple function that prints a message indicating installation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "The code uses print(), which outputs to standard output but does not pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina' that prints a message and then calls this function. There are no external data inputs, no sensitive operations, no code injection points, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and appears to be a benign example or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply outputs a message and does not perform any harmful actions.",
