  "purpose": "A simple Python script that defines and calls a function to print 'installed'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only prints to standard output.",
  "flows": "Function call flow from 'ina()' to 'print(\"installed\")'. No untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'ina()' that outputs a static string 'installed' and calls it immediately. It contains no external inputs, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. All signals indicate benign intent, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, benign script that outputs a message. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
