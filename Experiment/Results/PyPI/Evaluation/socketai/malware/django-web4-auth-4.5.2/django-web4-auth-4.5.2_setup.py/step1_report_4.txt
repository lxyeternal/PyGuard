{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with a post-installation hook that performs network requests and potentially malicious downloads.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', fetching URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw ' + env, downloading and executing a file from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr'.",
  "sinks": "os.system('start '+filename) executes downloaded file, requests.get() fetching external content.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL construction -> network request to 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com' -> downloaded executable -> system call to run the executable.",
  "anomalies": "The script collects environment data, sends it to a suspicious URL, downloads and executes a potentially malicious file without user consent, and ignores exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defines a function 'send' that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this data to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable from an external domain and executes it silently. The 'PostInstallCommand' class overrides the install process to call 'send' after installation. The setup configuration specifies a package name and version, and sets the custom install command. The behavior indicates an attempt to gather system info, exfiltrate data, and run malicious code post-installation. The use of broad exception handling conceals errors, increasing risk. Overall, the code performs actions that are highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior: it collects system information, exfiltrates it, downloads and executes external malware, and suppresses errors. It poses a significant security threat and should not be used.",
