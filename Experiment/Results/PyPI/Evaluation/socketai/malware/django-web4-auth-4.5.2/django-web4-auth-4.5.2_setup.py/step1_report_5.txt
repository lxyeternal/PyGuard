{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom post-installation step that executes a function called 'send'.",
  "sources": "The 'send' function reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; it also makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The 'send' function executes system commands to start a downloaded file; it performs network requests that could leak data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is included in a URL request; the system executes the downloaded executable file after download.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external domain and executes it without verification; it collects environment info and sends it over the network.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging tools and adds a custom install command that, upon running, calls 'send'. The 'send' function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends it via a GET request to a suspicious domain 'linkedopports.com'. It also downloads a potentially malicious executable from 'python-release.com' and executes it directly using 'os.system'. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system info and run arbitrary code from an external source during package installation. There are no input sanitization or validation steps, and the URLs appear suspicious. The code is embedded within the setup script, which executes during package installation, a common technique for malicious payload delivery in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing an external payload during installation. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous, indicative of malicious intent to compromise systems upon package installation.",
