  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script with a custom post-install command that executes a send function during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; URLs in requests.get calls; system call to execute downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs; executing downloaded executable via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> send() -> requests.get() to send info; requests.get() to download executable -> os.system() to run executable.",
  "anomalies": "Download of executable from suspicious URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') and execution of it; use of try-except without handling errors; use of 'COMPUTERNAME' env variable for info collection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a send() function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then sends this info to a remote server. It then downloads a potentially malicious executable from a suspicious URL and executes it without user consent. The custom install command triggers send() during installation. The use of external requests to suspicious domains and executing downloaded files indicates malicious intent. No other benign purpose is evident. The code structure confirms that the malicious actions are embedded in the post-install process, making this a supply chain risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which poses a significant security threat. It appears designed to perform unauthorized actions on the user's system, likely malicious.",
