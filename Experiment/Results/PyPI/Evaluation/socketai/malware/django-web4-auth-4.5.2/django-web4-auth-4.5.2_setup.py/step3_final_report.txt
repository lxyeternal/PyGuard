{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform actions during package installation, including collecting system information, sending it to a remote server, downloading an executable from a suspicious URL, and executing it silently, which indicates malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com', network requests, and file download operations.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, writing and executing a downloaded executable via os.system.",
  "flows": "System info collected from environment variable -> sent via GET request -> executable downloaded from remote URL -> executed silently.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling hiding errors, use of suspicious URLs, silent execution of external payloads, no verification of downloaded files.",
  "analysis": "The code reads system environment info and sends it to a suspicious URL, then, if on Windows, downloads an executable from a known malicious domain and runs it silently. Exception handling is broad, hiding errors that could reveal malicious activity. The URLs used are suspicious, and executing external code without verification is a significant security risk. The behavior aligns with typical supply chain malware, involving data exfiltration and remote code execution. The code's straightforward structure confirms malicious intent, with no obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including data exfiltration, remote payload download, and silent execution, posing a high security threat. The malware score should be set to 1, obfuscated score remains 0, and overall security risk is high (1).",
