{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for installing a Python package and executing additional actions during installation, including possibly downloading and executing an external executable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Requests are made to external URLs, and an executable file is downloaded and executed via os.system('start ...').",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to a remote server via URL, and the downloaded executable is run on the local system.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently catches all exceptions, which can hide malicious activity. It downloads and executes an external executable during installation without user consent or verification. The URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' looks suspicious and may host malicious code. The external request includes environment data, potentially leaking information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, and requests for network communication. The 'send()' function retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a questionable domain and executes it silently. The exception handling suppresses errors, hiding any failure or malicious activity. The PostInstallCommand class extends the install command to run 'send()' after installation. The setup configuration specifies package details but does not restrict or verify the downloaded executable.\nOverall, the code performs suspicious network communication and remote code execution during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by silently sending system information to an external server and downloading/executing a remote executable without user consent. These actions pose security risks, including remote code execution and data leakage. The code is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
