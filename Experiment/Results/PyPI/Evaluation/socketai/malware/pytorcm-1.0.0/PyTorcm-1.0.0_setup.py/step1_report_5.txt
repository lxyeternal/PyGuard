{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to configure and install a Python package named 'PyTorcm'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings (VERSION, DESCRIPTION, LONG_DESCRIPTION), environment info (os.name), and external modules ('requests', 'fernet'). It also imports packages and runs a custom installation command.",
  "sinks": "The code decrypts and executes encrypted code within the custom install command, which may potentially be malicious if the decrypted code performs harmful actions such as system compromise or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The script loads encrypted data with Fernet, decrypts it, and executes the resulting code during installation on Windows systems. The source is the encrypted string, and the sink is the exec() call executing decrypted code.",
  "anomalies": "The use of encrypted code that is decrypted and executed at install time is suspicious. The presence of the Fernet key and encrypted payload embedded in the code indicates potential obfuscation and malicious intent. No other suspicious code like hardcoded credentials or network activity is apparent outside this context.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and a custom install class that, on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes embedded code. The decryption uses a hardcoded Fernet key, and the payload is encrypted, likely to obfuscate malicious code. This dynamic execution during installation can be exploited for malicious purposes such as system compromise, data theft, or establishing backdoors. The rest of the script appears typical for a setup configuration, but the encrypted code execution is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted code that executes during installation on Windows. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent, such as installing a backdoor or executing malicious payloads without user awareness. The rest of the script is typical, but the encrypted code execution is a significant security concern.",
