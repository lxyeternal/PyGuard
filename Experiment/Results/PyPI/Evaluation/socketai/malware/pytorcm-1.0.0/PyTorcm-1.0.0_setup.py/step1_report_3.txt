{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'PyTorcm' that includes a custom installation command with embedded malicious code.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment details (os.name), imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, and decrypts embedded encrypted data.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which is a potential execution sink.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking OS type, importing modules, decrypting data, and executing the decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload and execution via exec() without any validation. Use of Fernet decryption key embedded in the code. The long strings and obfuscated class names suggest obfuscation and concealment. No legitimate setup purpose for decryption and execution are evident.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard modules and defines a custom install class that overrides run(). If the OS is Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts embedded data using a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes it via exec(). The decryption payload could contain malicious code, and executing decrypted code at install time is suspicious and dangerous. The code's obfuscation and encrypted payload strongly suggest malicious intent or sabotage, as it can execute arbitrary code during installation. The rest of the setup code appears standard but is overshadowed by the malicious execution.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior: decrypting and executing code at install time, likely malicious. It uses obfuscation and encryption to hide malicious payloads. This package should not be used due to high risk of executing arbitrary and harmful code.",
