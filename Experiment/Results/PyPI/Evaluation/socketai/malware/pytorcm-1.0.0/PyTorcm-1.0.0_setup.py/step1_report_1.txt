{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the PyTorcm package, primarily for installing and configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables (OS name), package metadata fields, and external dependencies (requests, fernet). Includes embedded encrypted code in the run method.",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code via exec() which is a potential code execution sink.",
  "flows": "Conditional import and decryption of code when OS is Windows; decrypted code is executed via exec(), potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an encrypted payload executed conditionally, use of exec() on decrypted data, hardcoded Fernet key, encrypted code that is likely malicious or obfuscated. The purpose of decrypting and executing code suggests potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that imports standard setup tools and defines package metadata. A custom install class overrides the run method, which on Windows (nt), imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes embedded code using a hardcoded Fernet key. This behavior is suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution during installation, especially considering the encrypted payload and use of exec(). Such behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks or backdoors. The package dependencies include 'fernet' and 'requests', which are standard but are also used in the malicious code decryption process. Overall, the code appears intentionally obfuscated and designed to execute hidden code during installation, which poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a hidden malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() indicates malicious intent, representing a severe security threat. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
