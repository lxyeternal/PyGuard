{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'PyTorcm', including a custom installation command that performs additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "User inputs via setup parameters; execution of code within the custom install class; embedded decryption and request modules.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code which may include malicious commands; potential network requests via 'requests' module; decryption process that could load and execute malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method checks OS; if Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload and executes it, possibly executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload with 'Fernet' and 'exec', which is highly suspicious; hardcoded decryption key and encrypted payload; code executes upon installation without user consent; obfuscated class and variable names; embedded long strings resembling random data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script with a custom install class that, on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with a hardcoded key and executes it dynamically via 'exec'. This behavior is highly unusual for a standard setup script and suggests malicious intent, as it could be loading and executing malicious code silently during installation. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is typical of malicious supply chain components designed to conceal malicious payloads. The code's obfuscated variable and class names, combined with the encrypted payload, further indicate malicious intent or sabotage. No benign or necessary functionality justifies such behavior in a standard setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing decrypted payload during installation, which can run arbitrary code without user knowledge. The use of encrypted payloads, hardcoded keys, and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, likely aiming to compromise systems during package installation.",
