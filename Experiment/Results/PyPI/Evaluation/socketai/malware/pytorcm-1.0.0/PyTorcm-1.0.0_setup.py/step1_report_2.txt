  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'PyTorcm', mainly to configure installation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, author, descriptions), environment info (os.name), and dependencies (setup_requires).",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code via exec() if on Windows, which can run arbitrary code from a remote source.",
  "flows": "If os.name == 'nt', imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload executed dynamically with Fernet, no visible source of the decrypted code, using exec() with remote-like encrypted content. Decrypts and executes potentially malicious code only on Windows systems.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is typical in structure but contains a hidden malicious behavior. When run on Windows, it imports secure modules (requests, Fernet), decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string, and executes the resulting code. This behavior is suspicious because it executes code at install time from an embedded encrypted payload, which could be malicious. The decryption key and payload are embedded in the script, indicating potential backdoor or malicious activity. The code does not do any verification or sandboxing before executing the decrypted code, increasing risk. Other parts of the script are benign, such as setting package metadata and dependencies, but the conditional execution of decrypted code is a high concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: decrypting and executing remote code during installation on Windows systems. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent or a backdoor, especially given the encrypted payload and use of exec(). The package could compromise systems upon installation, posing a serious security threat.",
