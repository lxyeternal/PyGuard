  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and data flows.",
  "sources": "Input data reads, environment variables, external dependencies, user inputs, configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through data processing, network calls, or system interactions, if present.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are missing or minimal, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The absence of code limits the ability to identify malicious flows or anomalies. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the limited information. Confidence levels are justified based on code presence and clarity. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation, and the low risk score reflects residual uncertainty due to incomplete code. The assessments are consistent and cautious, aligning with best practices for code review under uncertainty.",
  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and obfuscation, with low but cautious risk scores. The scores are justified given the missing or minimal code snippets. No modifications are necessary; the overall security posture remains benign.",
