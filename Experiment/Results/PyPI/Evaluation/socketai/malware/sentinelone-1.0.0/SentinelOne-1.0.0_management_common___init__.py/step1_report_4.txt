{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package meant for data processing or utility functions, although the specific purpose cannot be conclusively determined due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from imported modules, but no explicit external data sources or user input handling is visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, subprocess calls, or file operations, but none are explicitly present or suspicious in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows indicating untrusted data propagation; the code mainly performs static computations and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are observed. The code appears clean and straightforward, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows standard Python syntax with imports, function definitions, and computations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code structure is clear, with no evident malicious payloads, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The absence of network activity, cryptic variables, or hidden code supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the thorough review, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or processing module without malicious intent. The confidence level is high, given the lack of suspicious elements.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
