  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'SentinelOne'.",
  "sources": "Static strings assigned to variables and passed directly to setup(), no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static data used directly in setup() call without transformation.",
  "anomalies": "License field contains 'SentinelOne', which is unconventional as a license identifier but not malicious; variable 'package_version' is defined but unused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script importing standard functions, defining a version string, and calling setup() with hardcoded parameters. No dynamic behavior, input, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The license string 'SentinelOne' is non-standard but not malicious. The unused variable 'package_version' is a minor oversight but not suspicious. Overall, the script is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor anomaly is the license string, which does not pose a security risk. The security risk score should remain very low, around 0.1, reflecting the unconventional license string but no actual threat.",
