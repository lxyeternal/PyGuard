{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named SentinelOne",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for package name, version, and license; no external input sources are present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of the 'license' field with a string that appears to be a name rather than a license identifier, but this is not inherently malicious; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools and defines package metadata with hardcoded values. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data handling. The license field is a string but not an indication of malicious activity. The setup call appears straightforward and standard for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
