  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution of the SentinelOne Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; assignment of package_version; setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; setup() mainly registers package info.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no flow paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; setup parameters appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple setup script importing setuptools to define package metadata. It assigns a version string and calls setup() with basic name, version, and license parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of external input, and no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed. The script aligns with standard Python packaging practices and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
