  "sources": "Reads package name, version, and license information for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no input/output flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of setuptools for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines a version string, and calls setup() with static package metadata. There are no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. The script is a standard package setup file without any embedded malicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
