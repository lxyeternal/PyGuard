  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'SentinelOne'.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for package name, version, and license.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only defines setup parameters without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard setuptools functions and straightforward assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, defines a package version, and calls 'setup' with static values for name, version, and license. There are no dynamic or suspicious behaviors, no input reading, or untrusted data handling. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
