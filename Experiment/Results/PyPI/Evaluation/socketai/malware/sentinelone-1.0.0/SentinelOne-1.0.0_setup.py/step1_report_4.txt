  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and variable assignment for package version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Lack of descriptive license information; minimal setup parameters; no use of environment variables or dynamic data",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary setup functions from setuptools, assigns a static version string, and calls setup() with name, version, and license. The license field is set to a string 'SentinelOne', which is unusual as licenses typically follow standard identifiers or SPDX formats. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The simplicity reduces suspicion but also offers limited context; however, no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. The license field's content is unusual but not malicious. Overall, it appears safe and typical for package distribution purposes.",
