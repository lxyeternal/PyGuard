  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external modules, files, network sources, data processing functions",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, console output",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) through processing functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify absence of code or malicious activity, with appropriate scores. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2). Confidence levels are high (0.8), reflecting cautious but benign assessments. Minor potential for untrusted data misuse is acknowledged but no evidence of malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. Given the lack of code snippets and malicious indicators, the current scores are appropriate. Slightly lowering the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 could improve precision, but the existing scores are acceptable. Overall, the dependency appears benign with minimal security concern.",
