  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility or script related to some form of data processing or network communication, but the specific intent cannot be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user input, or external modules, such as reading configuration or input data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or executing system commands, which could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables or user input) to sensitive sinks such as network or file operations, possibly via data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies like hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or malicious backdoors are detected. The code structure appears standard; however, the presence of dynamic execution or unusual code constructs should be checked further if present.",
  "analysis": "The analysis of the code shows standard imports and function definitions. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining. The code does not include hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscation. Usage of external libraries is typical for such scripts. Without additional context or hidden code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current visible code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behavior detected.",
