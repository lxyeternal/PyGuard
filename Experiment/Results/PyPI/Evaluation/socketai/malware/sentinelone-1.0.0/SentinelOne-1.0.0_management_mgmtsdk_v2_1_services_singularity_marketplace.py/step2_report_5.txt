  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** The review is thorough, noting standard network interactions, proper error handling, and no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues found. The report's reasoning is sound.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard API interactions, no malicious code, and legitimate behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — the risk score is slightly above zero, which might be conservative but acceptable given the network interaction nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since the code interacts over network and processes data, a small residual risk exists, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing legitimate API client behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning aligns with the scores.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client with no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Inputs influence request construction, but no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The low risk score reflects the low likelihood of issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, straightforward API client.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears secure and legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in all cases, reflecting the network interaction and data handling. This is reasonable given the context; no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor inherent risk due to network communication, but no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and their scoring aligns with the analysis. No modifications are necessary. The code is a standard, secure API client wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated content.",
