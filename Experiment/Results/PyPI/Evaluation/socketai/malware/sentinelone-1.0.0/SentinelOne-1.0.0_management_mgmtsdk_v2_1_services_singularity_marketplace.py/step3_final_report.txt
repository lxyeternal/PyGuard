  "purpose": "Client wrapper for interacting with a marketplace API, performing operations such as querying catalogs, installing, updating, enabling/disabling, and deleting applications.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for query filters, application IDs, catalog IDs, configurations, and network request responses.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external API endpoints, response handling, and exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence request construction; responses are checked for success; data is returned or exceptions raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution; standard API interaction patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with proper error handling, no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It uses external 'client' for network requests, processes parameters to build requests, and raises exceptions on failures. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The network interactions are typical for such clients, and the code's clarity suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minimal security risk score (around 0.2) is justified due to network interactions but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
