  "purpose": "Define a BaseEntity class with a method to serialize its attributes to JSON, converting attribute names from CamelCase to snake_case.",
  "sources": "Class attributes accessed via self.__dict__, input data not directly read from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of attribute names to snake_case, serialization to JSON-like dictionary.",
  "flows": "self.__dict__ -> to_snake_case() -> to_json() -> return JSON dict",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The to_snake_case function performs standard regex-based string transformation, not obfuscated or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data serialization class with a helper function for attribute name conversion. No input/output sources that process untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, no external network communication, no handling of environment variables, and no suspicious logic. The class converts its attributes to a JSON-compatible dict, skipping None values, and recursively serializes nested BaseEntity instances. The to_snake_case function uses standard regex substitution for string formatting, which is safe and common. Overall, this code appears to be benign, intended for object serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for serializing class instances to JSON format with snake_case attribute names. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risk detected. It is safe and typical for data model classes.",
