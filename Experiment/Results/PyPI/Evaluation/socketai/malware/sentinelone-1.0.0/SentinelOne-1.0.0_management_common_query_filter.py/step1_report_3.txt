{
  "purpose": "Define classes and methods to build, validate, and transform query filters for an API interface, allowing flexible filtering with various operators.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method parameters such as key, val, op in 'apply', and filter arguments in 'get_query_params'. The class constructor and methods access class attributes and exception classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include the 'filters' dictionary where filter key-value pairs are stored, and the return values of 'get_query_params'. These are used to generate query parameters sent to the API.",
  "flows": "Input data from method arguments flows into 'apply' and 'get_query_params', where they are validated, potentially transformed, and stored in 'filters' or returned as query parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily implements standard filter logic with no apparent hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs is present. Exception handling appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum-like class 'Op' for operators, and several classes for building query filters with validation and transformation logic. The 'apply' method validates allowed operators and populates a filters dictionary, which is used for querying. The 'get_query_params' method constructs query parameters from either a filter object or keyword arguments, with validation to prevent conflicting inputs. Helper classes handle splitting of filter strings. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling is present. The logic appears to be standard filter-building code with appropriate exception handling, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a filter construction utility for API queries, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It validates inputs, applies transformations, and generates query parameters. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
