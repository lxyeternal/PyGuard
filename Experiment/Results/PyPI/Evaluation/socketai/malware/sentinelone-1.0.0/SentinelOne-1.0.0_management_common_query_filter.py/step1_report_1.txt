  "purpose": "Defines a framework for constructing and validating query filters with support for multiple operators, intended for API interactions within a management SDK.",
  "sources": "Reading of class attributes, method parameters, and class constants such as QUERY_ARGS, filter arguments, and method inputs.",
  "sinks": "Application of filters via the apply method, which populates the filters dictionary; transformation methods generating query parameter strings.",
  "flows": "Input filter arguments are split and validated, then applied to filters, which are later used to build query parameters for API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic filter application with potential for misconfiguration; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no evidence of malicious code such as network calls or file manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements a query filter construction mechanism with validation of filter keys and operators, and transformation of filters into query parameters. It relies on predefined filter argument dictionaries and validation classes. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, or network operations are present. The filter validation process appears standard and secure, with proper exception handling for invalid filters or operators. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code's purpose is to support safe query construction for an API, not to perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured query filter framework with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain malware, secret backdoors, or security vulnerabilities beyond expected validation. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
