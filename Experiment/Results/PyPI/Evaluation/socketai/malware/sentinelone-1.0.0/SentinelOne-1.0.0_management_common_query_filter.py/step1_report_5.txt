{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and methods for constructing and applying query filters, primarily for API interactions, including scope filters with specific allowed parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the class attributes (e.g., QUERY_ARGS), method parameters (e.g., key, val, op, filter_args), and imported exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe sink points include raising exceptions based on input validation and applying filters which could be misused if inputs are malicious; no direct data leaks or code execution points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters (apply, get_query_params, constructor args) through validation and transformation functions, ultimately constructing a filters dictionary for API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. Exception handling is standard; the code appears to perform expected validation and transformation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines filter classes for building query parameters, with validation and transformation logic to prevent invalid filters. It checks allowed fields and operators, transforming filter keys accordingly. No dynamic code execution, external command calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Exception handling is used for input validation failures. The overall design seems intended for safe query parameter construction without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of query filter construction with proper validation, and does not contain malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
