{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing and applying query filters with various operators, mainly for API interactions involving scope and filtering criteria.",
  "sources": "The code reads from class attributes (QUERY_ARGS), method parameters (key, val, op, filter_args), and the class state (self.filters). It also constructs filter strings and raises exceptions based on input validation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'apply' method inserts user-supplied data into self.filters which can be used in API requests or database queries. The get_query_params method generates a dictionary of query parameters from user input or filter objects.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from filter_args or method arguments flows into the 'apply' method, which adds to self.filters; this data is then retrieved via get_query_params for API calls. Transform functions convert keys and operators into API-specific strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code relies on exception raising for invalid inputs but does not perform any harmful actions or insecure data handling. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured filtering system with clear input validation and transformation logic. It uses exception handling for invalid filters and operators, but does not perform any data leaks, network activity, or system modifications. It appears to be a standard filter management library, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate filter utility for API query parameters. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The security risk score is very low, and there are no suspicious or harmful patterns detected.",
