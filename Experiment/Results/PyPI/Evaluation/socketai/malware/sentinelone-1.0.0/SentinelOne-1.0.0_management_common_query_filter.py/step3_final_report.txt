  "purpose": "Framework for constructing, validating, and transforming API query filters with support for various operators and scope filters.",
  "sources": "Input filter arguments, filter object properties, and filter application points within API call preparations.",
  "sinks": "Application of filters to query parameters, transformation functions generating filter strings, and validation routines that process input data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into filter application methods, which validate and transform data before storing in filter dictionaries used for API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing query filters with validation and transformation logic. It validates filter fields and operators, transforms filter keys for API compatibility, and supports scope-based filtering. No malicious code, network calls, or obfuscation patterns are present. The code relies on standard validation and exception handling, with no dynamic code execution or external data leaks. The overall structure is clear, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented query filter utility with proper validation and transformation. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score reflects minimal security concern, primarily related to potential misuse if inputs are malicious, which is mitigated by validation. The scores and assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
