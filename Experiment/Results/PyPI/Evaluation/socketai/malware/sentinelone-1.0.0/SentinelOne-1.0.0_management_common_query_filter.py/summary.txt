  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented query filter utility with proper validation and transformation. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score reflects minimal security concern, primarily related to potential misuse if inputs are malicious, which is mitigated by validation. The scores and assessments are consistent and appropriate."
