  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers and levels based on environment variables for a management SDK.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform information; temporary directory retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Writing log data to a file specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH' or a default path; outputting logs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log path and level; these settings determine how logs are handled and where they are stored; log messages are generated through logger calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control log configuration is standard; no suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger with configurable log level and file path via environment variables. It uses system platform info to determine default temp directory. Log handlers include a file handler and a stdout stream handler with consistent formatting. The environment variable 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' controls whether handlers are set, defaulting to true. No malicious or suspicious logic is present; the code simply manages logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely to configure logging handlers with environment-dependent parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup for logging within a Python SDK.",
