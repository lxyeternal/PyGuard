  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers with environment-based settings for the SDK.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'.",
  "sinks": "Log file at path specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH' or default; stdout stream.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log configuration; log handlers write to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution; environment-based configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers based on environment variables, allowing dynamic configuration of log file location and level. It uses standard Python logging mechanisms with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The use of environment variables is typical for configurable SDKs. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are directly involved beyond environment variables. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code performs straightforward logging setup safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration routine with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on environment variables for configuration, which is common and not inherently suspicious.",
