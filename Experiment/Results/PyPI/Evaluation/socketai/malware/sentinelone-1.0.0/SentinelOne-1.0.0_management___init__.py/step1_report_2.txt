  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the SDK, setting log level and log file path based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform information.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code writes logs to file and stdout based on configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and log path, which affect file and stream handlers; no untrusted data directly affects system behavior or data flow beyond logging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for log configuration is common; no secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The default log path uses system temp directories, which is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with configurable log level and log file location, based on environment variables. It uses standard Python logging practices, including formatter setup and environment variable defaults. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. The only minor concern could be that logs are written to a temporary directory, which might be cleared or accessed by other processes, but this is typical for debug logging and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward and safe logging setup routine with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
