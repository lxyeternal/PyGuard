{
  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers with customizable log file path and level, and add them to a named logger.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' for configuration; system platform info for directory selection.",
  "sinks": "Log file path where logs are written; stdout for log output display.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine log path and level; configuration code sets up handlers accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or hidden behaviors; straightforward logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging handlers based on environment variables. It retrieves log path and level from environment variables, with defaults provided. It then configures file and stream handlers for a logger named 'MgmtSdk'. The code uses standard Python logging practices and system functions to determine paths. No user input, untrusted data, or dynamic code execution is involved. The use of environment variables for configuration is typical, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign configuration script.",
