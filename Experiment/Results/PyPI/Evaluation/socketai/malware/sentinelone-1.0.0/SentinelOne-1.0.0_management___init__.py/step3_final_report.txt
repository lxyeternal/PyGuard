  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the 'MgmtSdk' logger based on environment variables, with default settings directing logs to system temp directories.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform info for default log directory.",
  "sinks": "FileHandler writing to log file path; StreamHandler outputting to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and path; handlers are added to the logger, which outputs logs accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard logging setup; no secrets or obfuscation; use of temp directories is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger with handlers configured via environment variables, using standard Python logging practices. It determines log file location based on platform and environment variables, defaulting to system temp directories. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward and intended for configurable logging, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging configuration routine with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of environment variables and temp directories is typical and not malicious. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflecting potential configuration manipulation but no actual threat.",
