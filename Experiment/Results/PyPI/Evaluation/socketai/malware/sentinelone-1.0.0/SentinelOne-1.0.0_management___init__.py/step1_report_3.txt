{
  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the MgmtSdk module, setting log file and level based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' for log configuration; system platform info and tempfile module for path determination.",
  "sinks": "Log messages written to a file specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH' and stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to determine log path and level, then logs are written to the specified file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of environment variables for log configuration is standard but could be manipulated in certain environments.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers for the 'MgmtSdk' logger. It determines the log file path based on environment variables, with a default path depending on the operating system. Log level is also configurable via environment variables, defaulting to 'debug'. The code adds file and stream handlers with consistent formatting. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The environment variables could be exploited to redirect logs or increase verbosity but do not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration setup that dynamically adapts to environment variables. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code segment.",
