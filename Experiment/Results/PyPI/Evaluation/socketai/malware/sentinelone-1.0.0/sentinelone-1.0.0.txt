      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor anomaly is the license string, which does not pose a security risk. The security risk score should remain very low, around 0.1, reflecting the unconventional license string but no actual threat."

The use of environment variables and temp directories is typical and not malicious. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflecting potential configuration manipulation but no actual threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented query filter utility with proper validation and transformation. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score reflects minimal security concern, primarily related to potential misuse if inputs are malicious, which is mitigated by validation. The scores and assessments are consistent and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. Given the lack of code snippets and malicious indicators, the current scores are appropriate. Slightly lowering the security risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 could improve precision, but the existing scores are acceptable. Overall, the dependency appears benign with minimal security concern."
