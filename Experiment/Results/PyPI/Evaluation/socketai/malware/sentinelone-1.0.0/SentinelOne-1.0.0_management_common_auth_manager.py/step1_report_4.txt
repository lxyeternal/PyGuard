  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and token state for HTTP requests",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code snippet",
  "sinks": "No data is written or sent to untrusted sinks; no external communication or data leakage points are evident",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present as the code only initializes data structures",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious operations, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns",
  "analysis": "This class initializes authentication-related attributes, including headers, cookies, and a token. The code is minimal, only setting up internal state without performing any network operations, data processing, or input handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard authentication manager class with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a simple setup without external communication or sensitive data handling beyond initialization.",
