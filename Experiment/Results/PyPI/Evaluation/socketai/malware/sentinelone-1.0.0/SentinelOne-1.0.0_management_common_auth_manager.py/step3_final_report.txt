  "purpose": "This code defines a simple authentication manager class that initializes headers, cookies, and token attributes for managing authentication data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static attribute assignments within the __init__ method; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the static attribute assignments; there are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only initializes internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes static headers, cookies, and token attributes without external input, network communication, or data processing. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, and security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard class initializer with no malicious behavior or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications or further security measures are necessary based on this snippet.",
