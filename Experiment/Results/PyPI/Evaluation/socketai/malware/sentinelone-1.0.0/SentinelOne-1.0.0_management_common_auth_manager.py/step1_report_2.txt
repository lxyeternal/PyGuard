  "sources": "Initialization of headers, cookies, and token variables",
  "sinks": "Variables that may store sensitive data like tokens; no data flow to external sources or sinks shown",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class AuthManager with an __init__ method initializing headers with a content-type, and empty cookies and token variables. No external input handling, no network operations, no data leaks, and no malicious or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard setup code for managing authentication-related data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic class constructor for managing authentication data without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior based on the provided snippet.",
