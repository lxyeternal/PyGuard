  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and token state for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are explicitly read in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; no suspicious or unusual behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines an initializer that sets up a headers dictionary with a fixed content-type, an empty cookies dictionary, and a token variable initialized to None. There are no external inputs, data processing, or security-sensitive operations performed here. The code appears to be a simple setup for handling authentication tokens and headers, typical in API client implementations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detectable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign class setup for managing authentication state. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security risks within this snippet.",
