  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and tokens for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; class attributes are initialized but not populated from external input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present; no external communication or data leakage is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow is demonstrated within the code fragment; token is initialized as None and headers/cookies are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The class AuthManager initializes with static headers for JSON content-type, an empty cookies dictionary, and a None token. There are no data inputs, no external calls, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is minimal and typical for an authentication handler structure, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard class for managing authentication-related data. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected based on this fragment.",
