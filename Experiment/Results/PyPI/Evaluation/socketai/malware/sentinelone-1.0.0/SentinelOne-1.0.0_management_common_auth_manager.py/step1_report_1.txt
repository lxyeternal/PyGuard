  "flows": "No data flow beyond object initialization; no untrusted data processed or transmitted",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing authentication data with an initializer setting default headers, cookies, and token. It appears to be part of a larger authentication or request handling system. No input reading, no data leaks, and no external communications or malicious code are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a straightforward class initializer for authentication management with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated snippet.",
