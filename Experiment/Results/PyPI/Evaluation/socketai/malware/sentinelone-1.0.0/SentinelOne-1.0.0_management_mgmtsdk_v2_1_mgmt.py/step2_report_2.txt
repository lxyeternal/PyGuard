  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code extends an SDK, initializes multiple services, and calls `api.run()`. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The `api.run()` call appears to be a standard API initialization.\n\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, with high confidence (0.9). This seems reasonable given the evidence.\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The code is a typical SDK wrapper with no signs of supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, extending SDK, initializing services, calling `api.run()`. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. The `api.run()` likely performs an API setup.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, confidence 0.9. These are appropriate.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or anomalies. The code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—SDK extension, service initialization, `api.run()`. No obfuscation or secrets. The call seems to be standard API setup.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, confidence 0.9. Appropriate.\n\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports. The only notable operation is `api.run()`, which appears to be a standard API call during initialization.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, confidence 0.9. Slightly higher risk score, but still reasonable considering the context.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same overall structure. The `api.run()` call is again the only potentially sensitive operation, but it likely performs API setup.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, confidence 0.8. Slightly lower confidence but still consistent.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is a standard SDK extension, primarily initializing services and making an `api.run()` call. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n\n- **`api.run()` Call:** This is the only operation that warrants scrutiny. However, given its context—imported from a trusted SDK module and used during initialization—it appears to be a routine API setup, not malicious.\n\n- **Supply Chain Risks:** No signs of backdoors, hidden code, or malicious payloads. The code is clean, straightforward, and aligns with typical SDK extension patterns.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** The malware scores are all 0, which is justified. The risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern, primarily due to the `api.run()` call but without evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1–0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the `api.run()` call, but not concerning.\n\n**Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no supply chain or malicious activity detected.**",
