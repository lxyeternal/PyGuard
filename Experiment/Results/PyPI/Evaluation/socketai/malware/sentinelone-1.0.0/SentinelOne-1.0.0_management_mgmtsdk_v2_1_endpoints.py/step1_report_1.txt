{
  "purpose": "This module defines API endpoint URL paths for interacting with various SentinelOne management functions, including threat management, agent actions, tagging, firewall control, rogue device inventory, threat intelligence, application management, and other system configurations.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for API endpoint URL paths; no dynamic input handling present within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No immediate sinks such as network requests, file operations, or command executions are present in this code snippet itself; it merely defines endpoint URL strings for use elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible here as no functions, input handling, or data processing are implemented in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of constant string definitions for API endpoints. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The endpoints appear to follow consistent naming conventions aligned with typical REST API structures. There are commented-out lines that are benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident within these definitions.",
  "analysis": "This code only defines static URL path strings used to construct API requests within the SentinelOne management system. There are no input parsing, data handling, or execution commands. It does not perform any network operations or system modifications on its own. No anomalous patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The structure appears to be a configuration or constants module used by other parts of the system.\n\nGiven the limited scope—just endpoint path definitions—there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code's purpose is purely organizational, facilitating API interactions elsewhere in the application.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains only static API endpoint path definitions with no suspicious or malicious activity. It does not include any dynamic or executable logic that could pose security risks. Overall, it appears to be a benign configuration module.",
