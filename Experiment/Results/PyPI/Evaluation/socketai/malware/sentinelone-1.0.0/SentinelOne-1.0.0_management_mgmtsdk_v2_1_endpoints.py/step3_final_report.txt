{
  "purpose": "This code defines static string constants representing API endpoint URL paths used in SentinelOne management functions, serving as configuration or route definitions.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments, some with placeholders for runtime parameter insertion.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external effects; these are static definitions used elsewhere in API request construction.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing; placeholders are intended for runtime substitution, not handled here.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard REST API route definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants for API endpoints, with some placeholders for dynamic URL segments. There is no executable logic, data processing, or embedded secrets. The placeholders are typical for URL templates and require proper sanitization during use, but this is outside the scope of this static definitions module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets are present. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign collection of API endpoint constants with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening content. The minimal risk stems from potential misuse of URL parameters at runtime, which is outside this static scope. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use as a configuration resource.",
