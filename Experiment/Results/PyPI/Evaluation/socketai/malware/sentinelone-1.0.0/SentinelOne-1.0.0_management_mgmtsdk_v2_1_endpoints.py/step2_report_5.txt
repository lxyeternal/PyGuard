  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet provided and the criteria for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines API endpoint URL paths; no dynamic input or execution.\n- **Analysis:** Only static string constants, no data processing, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining URL endpoints with some placeholders.\n- **Analysis:** Static constants with placeholders for runtime substitution; no malicious code or secrets.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are 0, with a minor securityRisk of 0.1 due to potential misuse if runtime parameters are not sanitized.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The only minor concern is ensuring proper sanitization during URL usage, but that’s outside this code's scope.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above—API endpoint constants.\n- **Analysis:** Pure static strings, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and obfuscated are 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines API endpoints, some with parameters.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard practice of using placeholders.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, securityRisk at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, static endpoint definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate at 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, obfuscation, or secret leakage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward constant definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** Also correctly low, mostly 0, with a minor 0.1 in one report due to potential misuse of placeholders—acceptable given the scope.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the entire code snippet and reports, I concur that this is a benign, configuration-like module defining API endpoints. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering placeholder misuse, but that’s outside the code’s scope)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard constants module for API endpoints with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
