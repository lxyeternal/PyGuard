{
  "purpose": "The code defines URL endpoint constants for communication with various SentinelOne management APIs and services, facilitating actions such as threat management, agent control, firewall operations, and marketplace interactions.",
  "sources": "All endpoint URL strings, some dynamically formatted with parameters",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable endpoints that could be used with untrusted input, especially those with placeholders like '{}'",
  "flows": "Dynamic insertion of parameters into URL strings for API calls, e.g., '{}'.format() or f-strings used to generate specific API endpoint URLs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obvious malicious code patterns observed. All code consists of URL endpoint definitions. No code execution, data handling, or network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a set of constant string definitions representing API endpoints. It uses consistent naming conventions, with no apparent obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The placeholders in URL strings suggest that user input might be inserted at runtime, but this is standard practice for API URL construction. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The absence of actual network requests, data processing, or other code implies this module is a configuration or constants file. As such, it cannot execute malicious actions on its own. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign collection of API endpoint constants for SentinelOne management functions. No malicious or sabotage activity is evident. The module serves as a configuration component for API URL referencing, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
