{
  "purpose": "This module defines URL endpoints for SentinelOne management API communication, including threats, agents, policies, and other management functionalities.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions for API endpoint paths, formatted with string literals and some with placeholders for dynamic insertion.",
  "sinks": "These URL strings are used as API request paths; potential risks include misuse if combined with untrusted input, leading to injection or unintended access.",
  "flows": "Input data or parameters (such as IDs or commands) are inserted into URL paths using format placeholders, then used in API requests; no direct data processing or execution shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward constant definitions for URL endpoints. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains string constants for API URL paths, some with format placeholders for runtime substitution. There is no executable logic, data handling, or user input processing present. Since these are static endpoint definitions, the risk of malicious behavior or sabotage within this fragment is minimal. The pattern aligns with standard API client code. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or secret leaks. The only potential concern relates to proper sanitization of runtime parameters when these URLs are used, but that is outside the scope of this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of endpoint path constants used for API communication within SentinelOne management. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks embedded in these definitions. The code appears benign and typical for an API client module.",
