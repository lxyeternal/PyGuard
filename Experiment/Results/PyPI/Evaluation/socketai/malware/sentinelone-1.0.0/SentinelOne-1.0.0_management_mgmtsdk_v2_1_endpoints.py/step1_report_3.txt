  "purpose": "Define URL endpoints for various management, threat, agent, and system functions in the SentinelOne platform.",
  "sources": "String assignments for endpoint URL paths; no external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output found.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines static endpoint strings without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Endpoints are standard API paths, some with placeholders for IDs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constants representing API endpoints used by the SentinelOne platform. It includes endpoints for threats, agents, tags, firewall controls, rogue device inventory, star alerts, marketplace, remote scripts, ranger, application management, threat intelligence, and upgrade policies. No dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing is present. The structure is straightforward, static, and typical for API route definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. All endpoint strings are standard and documented as part of the management system. Since the code does not perform any data processing or network communication by itself, no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of static endpoint path constants used for API calls in SentinelOne. It shows no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. It appears to be a normal, benign configuration module defining API routes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
