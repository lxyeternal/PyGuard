  "purpose": "This module defines URL endpoint paths used for communication with SentinelOne management APIs, covering threats, agent actions, agents, tags, firewall control, rogues, alerts, marketplace, remote scripts, ranger, application management, threat intelligence, asset inventory, threat actions, and upgrade policies.",
  "sources": "String constants representing API endpoint paths. No input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed. The code is solely defining static URL path strings.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only maps endpoint strings for API calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous static string definitions for API endpoints. No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscation indicators are present. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of string constants that specify API endpoint paths used by the SentinelOne management system. These endpoints are used for threat management, agent actions, tag management, firewall controls, rogues device inventory, alerts, marketplace applications, remote scripts, ranger device reviews, application management, threat intelligence, asset inventory, threat actions, and upgrade policies. There are no functions, input processing, or data handling routines. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The purpose is purely organizational, facilitating API communication. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious behavior indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of constant endpoint path definitions for API communication with SentinelOne management services. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to standardize endpoint URLs within the larger system.",
