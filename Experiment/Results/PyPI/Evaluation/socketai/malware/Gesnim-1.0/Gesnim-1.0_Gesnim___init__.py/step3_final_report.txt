  "purpose": "This code defines a simple main() function that prints a static string, serving as a placeholder or minimal implementation.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or untrusted data read; the code is static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; the code only prints to standard output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code executes a straightforward print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial, static function with no external dependencies, inputs, or malicious indicators. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a placeholder. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with its characteristics. No further action or concern is warranted.",
