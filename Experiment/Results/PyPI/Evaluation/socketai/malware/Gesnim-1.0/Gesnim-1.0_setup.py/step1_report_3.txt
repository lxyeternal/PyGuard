{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also includes code that downloads and executes a file from a remote URL, which is suspicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote URL ('https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe') using requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The downloaded content is written to a file and then executed with os.system('start ' + filename), which could execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code flow reads data from the URL (source), writes it to a local file, and then executes that file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The script conditionally downloads and executes an executable only on Windows platforms, with no verification or user prompt, indicating potentially malicious intent. The URL points to an executable file, which is downloaded and run without any validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a function 'zzr' that checks if the platform is Windows. If so, it downloads a file from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately. This behavior is unusual for a package setup script. The rest of the code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, but the presence of remote code execution is highly suspicious. No validation, signatures, or user consent is implemented. This pattern is typical of malicious supply chain attacks where remote malware is executed upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during the package setup process on Windows systems. This is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
