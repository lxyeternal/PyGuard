{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also includes code that downloads and executes an external executable from a remote URL, which is suspicious.",
  "sources": "The function zzr() reads the system platform and conditionally retrieves a file from a remote URL using requests.get. It then writes the content to a file and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed directly using os.system('start ' + filename), which can run arbitrary code or malware on the system.",
  "flows": "Input from system platform influences whether the download occurs. The remote URL content flows into writing a file, which then flows into execution via os.system, establishing a malicious source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of an external executable only on Windows systems. The URL points to a raw GitHub link with a filename suggesting a Windows executable. The download and execution are triggered immediately during module import, which is unusual and suspicious. The code ignores non-Windows platforms entirely.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules and defining the function zzr(). This function checks if the platform is Windows ('win32'), then downloads an executable from a specified URL and executes it. The function is called immediately upon import, which is suspicious behavior for a legitimate setup script. The package setup information is standard, but the embedded code that fetches and runs an external executable is malicious or at least highly suspicious. This behavior resembles a supply chain attack or backdoor, as it downloads and runs arbitrary code from an external source without any user consent or verification. The rest of the setup configuration appears typical and harmless, but the initial code execution outweighs this.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior: it downloads and executes an external executable on Windows systems during import, which is highly suspicious and indicates potential malware. The overall security risk is high due to this behavior.",
