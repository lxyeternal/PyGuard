  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell code during setup, strongly indicating malicious intent. The high scores assigned are justified. Further decoding and analysis of the encoded command are essential to confirm malicious payloads. Until then, this package should be treated as a high-severity security risk."
