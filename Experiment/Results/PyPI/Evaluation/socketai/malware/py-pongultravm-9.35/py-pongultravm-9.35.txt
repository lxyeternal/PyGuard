      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, with encoded PowerShell execution, obfuscation, and suspicious URL references. The behavior aligns with common supply chain attack tactics. The package should be flagged as malicious, and further decoding of the PowerShell payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
