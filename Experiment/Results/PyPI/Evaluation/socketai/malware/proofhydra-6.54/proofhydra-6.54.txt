      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-probability malicious component: an obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during package setup. This pattern is characteristic of malware or supply chain sabotage. The high scores assigned in existing reports are justified, and the package should be treated as compromised until further payload analysis confirms benignity."
