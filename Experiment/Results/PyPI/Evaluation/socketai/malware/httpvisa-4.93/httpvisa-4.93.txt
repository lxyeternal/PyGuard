      "conclusion": "The code contains high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command designed to run covertly. The use of silent error handling and hidden window flags further suggest malicious intent. Scores are justified as malware 0.8, obfuscated 0.9, and security risk 0.85, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior and significant security threat."
