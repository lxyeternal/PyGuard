{
  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata for distribution using setuptools, specifying the package name, version, and license.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values assigned to variables and the parameters passed to setup().",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted or external data flows; the setup() parameters are hardcoded.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is straightforward static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The license field repeats the package name, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions, sets a version string, and calls setup() with basic metadata. There are no dynamic or user input components. No suspicious behaviors such as network calls, credential handling, or code execution are present. The code appears to be a minimal, standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution purposes.",
