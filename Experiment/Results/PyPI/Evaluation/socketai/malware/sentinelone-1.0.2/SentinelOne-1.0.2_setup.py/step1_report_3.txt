  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the SentinelOne Python package",
  "sources": "Assignment of package_version, import of setuptools modules",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data output or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of license parameter with a non-standard license string; no other anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script importing 'setuptools' and defining package metadata with name, version, and license. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The license field simply repeats the package name, which is unconventional but not malicious. No data leakage, no external network activity, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The only minor anomaly is the non-standard license string, which does not pose a security risk.",
