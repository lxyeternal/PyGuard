  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'SentinelOne' with version '1.0.2'.",
  "sources": "Static strings assigned to 'name', 'version', and 'license' parameters in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external sources are used.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional license string 'SentinelOne' used as the license parameter, which is not a standard license identifier.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script importing 'setuptools' functions, defining package metadata with hardcoded strings, and calling setup(). No user input, environment variables, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present. The license field's value is unconventional but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the license string, which does not pose a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is effectively 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The only minor concern is the unconventional license string, which does not impact security. All assessments and scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
