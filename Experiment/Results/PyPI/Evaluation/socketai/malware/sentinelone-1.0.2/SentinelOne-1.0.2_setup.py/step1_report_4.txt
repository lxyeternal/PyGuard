{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'SentinelOne' with version 1.0.2.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name, version, and license; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The license field is set to 'SentinelOne', which is unusual as licenses are typically standard license identifiers (e.g., MIT, Apache). The license field being a company name is suspicious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only uses setuptools to define package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data is involved. The static assignment of package details is normal for setup scripts. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
