{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging the SentinelOne Python project.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name ('SentinelOne') and version ('1.0.2')",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data exposure present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'license' parameter to set a string that matches the package name; minimal but unconventional use of license field",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines fixed strings for package version and license, and calls setup with these values. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data is processed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. The license field is assigned a string identical to the package name, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The code is minimal and appears legitimate.",
