  "obfuscated": 0.6,

  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious behaviors, warranting cautious scoring. The adjusted malware score for Report 5 to 0.6 aligns with the observed patterns. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient evidence of malicious activity. Overall, the dependency poses a moderate security concern, primarily due to obfuscation and network activity, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present."
