  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables, function parameters, and possibly environment variables or files (if present), but no explicit external input sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions like print, logging, writing to files, or network requests (if present), but no explicit sinks are identified in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, with no evident dangerous transformations or dangerous output functions connected to untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code are evident. No unusual or malicious constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python functions and control structures. No external data input or output mechanisms suggest malicious intent. There are no signs of code injection, unsafe handling of data, or obfuscated logic. The absence of network activity, credential handling, or sensitive data operations supports the conclusion that this code is benign. Without more context, it appears to be a regular utility or application logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems benign and does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns.",
