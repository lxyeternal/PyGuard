  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task (not specified in the prompt), potentially involving data processing or system interaction, but no explicit functionality can be determined without the code content.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, input functions, file reads, or network requests (exact sources cannot be specified without code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, or data leaks via printing or logging (specific sinks are not identifiable without code).",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to output sinks may occur, but the exact flow path cannot be determined without code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or unusual code patterns are detectable without viewing the actual code. Hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behaviors are not explicitly visible.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of code content, a detailed analysis cannot be performed. Based on the guidelines, the review cannot identify malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security issues without actual code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident from the prompt alone.",
  "conclusion": "There is no visible code to review for malicious behavior or security issues. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks can be identified without the code content. The code appears benign based on the provided input.",
