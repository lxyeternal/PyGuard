{
  "purpose": "This module defines URL endpoints for API communication with SentinelOne management system, covering threats, settings, agents, tags, firewall, rogues, marketplace, remote scripts, ranger, application management, threat intelligence, asset inventory, threat actions, and upgrade policies.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions for API endpoint URLs, including some formatted strings with placeholders (e.g., '{}'). No external data input sources are present within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data directly leads to data leaks, system effects, or external calls within this code snippet. The strings are static URL patterns used for API requests.",
  "flows": "The code constructs endpoint URL patterns; these would be used by other modules to send requests. No data flow or untrusted input handling occurs here directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, embedded payloads, or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly defines static URL patterns without dynamic code execution or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of constant string definitions representing API endpoints for various SentinelOne management functionalities. No input processing, data handling, or executable logic exists here. The placeholders '{}' suggest these are to be formatted with actual parameters during runtime, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a well-structured, static declaration of API endpoint URLs used elsewhere in the application.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of static API endpoint definitions with no malicious behavior, no dynamic execution, or obfuscation. It serves as a reference for API URL patterns within the system, and there are no security risks or malicious signals detected in this code fragment.",
