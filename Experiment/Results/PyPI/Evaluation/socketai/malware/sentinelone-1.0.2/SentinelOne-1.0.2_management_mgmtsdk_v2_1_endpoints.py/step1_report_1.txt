{
  "purpose": "This module defines a comprehensive set of endpoint URL paths used by the SentinelOne management system to communicate with various services and functionalities such as threats, agents, tags, firewall control, rogue device management, threat intelligence, and more.",
  "sources": "The code primarily consists of string constants assigned to endpoint URL paths. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "The URL endpoints are used for network requests; no direct untrusted data handling or data leaks are apparent. The paths are static strings with placeholders for URL formatting.",
  "flows": "This code maps endpoint names to URL paths; these paths are used elsewhere in the application to form network requests. There are no data flows or processing within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or dynamic execution features are present. The code is straightforward, with only string constants and format strings. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a list of static string constants representing API endpoints for various management functions. The endpoints cover a broad range of functionalities such as threat management, agent actions, tag management, firewall controls, rogue device inventory, threat intelligence, and policy upgrades. The use of format strings for dynamic URL construction (e.g., '{}') is standard practice and does not indicate obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. The code does not process or handle untrusted input, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited maliciously. Its purpose is purely to centralize endpoint URL definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static definition of API endpoints used by the SentinelOne management system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The structure and content are typical for API client libraries, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
