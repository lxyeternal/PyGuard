{
  "purpose": "Defines URL endpoints for communication between the SentinelOne management system and various modules/services.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions used as API endpoint paths, primarily for constructing API requests.",
  "sinks": "Usage in HTTP requests to external or internal services; potentially dangerous if these endpoints are misused or manipulated.",
  "flows": "API endpoint strings are used to formulate requests to various management services, threats, agents, and external integrations.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. Endpoints appear static and well-structured. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No suspicious functions or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constants defining API endpoint paths for a management system. No executable logic, data handling, or input/output operations are present. The endpoints cover a broad range of management functionalities, such as threats, agents, firewall, tags, ranger, remote scripts, and marketplace. The design appears consistent and standard for API path definitions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or code designed to perform harmful actions. All strings are static, and no dynamic evaluation or obfuscation is used. The code's purpose is to provide endpoint URL constants; it does not perform any operations that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of API endpoint definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements. It serves as configuration or reference data for API interactions. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks within this code snippet.",
