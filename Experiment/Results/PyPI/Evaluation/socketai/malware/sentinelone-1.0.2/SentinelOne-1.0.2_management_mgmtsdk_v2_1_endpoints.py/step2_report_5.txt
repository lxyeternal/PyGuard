  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes the code as static endpoint definitions.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; no dynamic data, just string constants.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The conclusion that this is benign, standard API endpoint constants is justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  These are appropriate given the static nature and lack of suspicious content.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correct; similar description.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; static strings used for request construction.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately concludes benign intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Valid and consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct; static strings with no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Properly states that these are static URL patterns with placeholders, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is justified; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; notes the presence of string formatting placeholders.\n- **Anomalies:** Here, the report raises a valid point: placeholders ('{}') could be exploited if external input is used unsafely during URL formatting.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly emphasizes that improper sanitization of these placeholders could lead to security issues, although the code itself only defines the templates.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, but **securityRisk = 0.2**.  \n  This is reasonable because the main concern is the potential misuse if formatting is not sanitized, not that the code itself is malicious.\n\n**Justification for risk score:**  \nWhile the code is benign, the presence of placeholders means that elsewhere in the application, improper URL construction could lead to injection or security vulnerabilities. Assigning a small risk score (0.2) is justified, but not higher, since the code itself doesn't perform any unsafe operations.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe malware score remains at 0, as there's no malicious code. The risk score is appropriately set at 0.2, reflecting a potential security concern if URL formatting is mishandled.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Correct; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Properly states that these are static endpoint definitions, standard for SDKs.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a static collection of URL path constants.\n- The only noteworthy point is the use of string formatting placeholders ('{}') in some URLs, which could be misused if not sanitized during runtime.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to placeholders that could be exploited if URL construction is insecure)\n- **Justification:** The code itself is benign, but the presence of placeholders warrants a slight security concern if not handled properly elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious behavior or code present.                                                          |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Clear, static string constants with no obfuscation.                                              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2          | Use of placeholders ('{}') in URLs could be exploited if external input is not sanitized.       |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is benign, with a minor security consideration regarding URL formatting.",
