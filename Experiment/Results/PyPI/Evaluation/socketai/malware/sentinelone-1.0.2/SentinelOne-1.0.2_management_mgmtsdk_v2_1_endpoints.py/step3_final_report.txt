  "purpose": "Defines static URL endpoint patterns for SentinelOne management API interactions.",
  "sources": "Static string constants, no untrusted input read.",
  "sinks": "Used in network requests; no data leaks or processing within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows; these are URL templates used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs; some URLs contain '{}' placeholders.",
  "analysis": " The code consists solely of static string constants representing API endpoints. The use of '{}' placeholders is standard for URL templates and does not indicate malicious intent. The primary concern is that if these placeholders are populated with untrusted input without proper sanitization during URL construction, it could lead to injection or URL manipulation vulnerabilities. However, this risk is external to this code snippet and depends on how these templates are used in the broader application. No obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets are present. The code is straightforward and typical for API client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static collection of API endpoint URL patterns with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only potential security concern relates to the handling of placeholders during URL formatting elsewhere in the system. Proper input validation and sanitization in the usage context will mitigate this risk.",
