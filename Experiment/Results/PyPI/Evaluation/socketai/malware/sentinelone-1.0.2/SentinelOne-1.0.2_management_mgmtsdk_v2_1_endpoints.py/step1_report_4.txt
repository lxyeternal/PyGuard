  "purpose": "Defines endpoint URL paths for communication with SentinelOne management and related services.",
  "sources": "Constants defining URL paths, some of which include formatted string placeholders.",
  "sinks": "Potential URL path construction for API calls, possibly used with untrusted input if formatting is insecure.",
  "flows": "Formatted string placeholders (e.g., '{}') in URLs could be populated with external input, potentially leading to insecure URL construction if not properly sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting placeholders in URL endpoints without any evident validation or sanitization could be exploited if external input is used to generate these URLs. No other suspicious code such as network communication, data handling, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains static string constants representing URL paths for various API endpoints. Some URLs include format placeholders '{}', which suggest these are templates to be filled with dynamic data at runtime. There is no dynamic code execution, no network communication, no data processing, and no obfuscated code. The pattern of defining constants for API paths is standard in API client implementations. The presence of placeholders indicates that URL construction elsewhere in the code should carefully sanitize input to prevent injection or URL manipulation. No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors are observed within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward collection of API endpoint path templates with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The main concern is the use of placeholders that could be exploited if user input is used unsafely during URL formatting. Proper validation and sanitization should be enforced elsewhere in the application. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for API client configurations.",
