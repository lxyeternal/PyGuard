  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK extension with a single dynamic call to api.run(). There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary risk is if api is compromised, which is unlikely given its import path. The malware score should be low (around 0.1-0.2), and the overall security risk remains moderate due to the potential for external code execution. Verification of the api module's integrity is recommended."
