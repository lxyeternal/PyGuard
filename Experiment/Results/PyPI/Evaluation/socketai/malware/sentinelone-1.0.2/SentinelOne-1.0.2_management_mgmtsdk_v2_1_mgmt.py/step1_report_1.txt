  "purpose": "Define a Management class extending SDK capabilities for SentinelOne management console interactions, initializing multiple service modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SDK modules; __init__ method reading parameters; API call via api.run()",
  "sinks": "Assignment of self.api = api.run()",
  "flows": "Data flows from import modules and parameters to class attributes; api.run() call outputs assigned to self.api",
  "anomalies": "Potential concern in self.api = api.run() as 'api' is imported from management.mgmtsdk_v2_1.services without explicit validation, possibly executing external code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class extension and attribute initialization, importing various SDK modules. The only dynamic code execution is api.run(), which could invoke external code or network operations. The rest is standard SDK setup. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are evident. The api object is imported and invoked without any evident validation or security checks, which could be a concern if api.run() is malicious or untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mainly a straightforward SDK class extension with standard initializations. The call to api.run() warrants review, as it might execute external code or perform network operations. Overall, no clear malicious behavior is evident, but the invocation of api.run() is a potential point of concern.",
