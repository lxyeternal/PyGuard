  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and tokens for HTTP requests",
  "sources": "Initialization of headers, cookies, and token in the constructor",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only internal assignment during object creation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The class defines an __init__ method that initializes an HTTP headers dictionary, an empty cookies dictionary, and a token variable set to None. There are no external data inputs, no processing, no network operations, and no code execution or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard setup for managing authentication state within an application, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class constructor initializing authentication-related attributes without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
