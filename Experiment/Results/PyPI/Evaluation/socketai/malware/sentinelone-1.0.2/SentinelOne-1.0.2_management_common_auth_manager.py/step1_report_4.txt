  "purpose": "Initialize an authentication management object with headers, cookies, and token storage.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since no external input or output is present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The class defines an __init__ method that sets up headers for content-type, initializes an empty cookies dictionary, and a token attribute set to None. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a basic setup for managing authentication data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class constructor with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard setup for an authentication manager without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
