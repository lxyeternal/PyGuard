  "purpose": "Initialize authentication-related data structures such as headers, cookies, and token.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only internal attribute initialization.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constructor with standard attribute setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'AuthManager' with an __init__ method that sets up headers, cookies, and token attributes. There are no external inputs, network operations, or suspicious code patterns. The code is simple, with no hardcoded secrets beyond a standard content-type header. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is consistent across multiple reports, with all assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The overall structure and behavior do not suggest any malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class constructor for managing authentication data. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be set to zero, reflecting its harmless nature.",
