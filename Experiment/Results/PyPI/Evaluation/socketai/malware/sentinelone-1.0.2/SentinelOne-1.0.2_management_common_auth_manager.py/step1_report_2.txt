  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and tokens for HTTP requests",
  "sources": "No input sources; class initialization does not read external data",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data is sent or stored in a way that could cause harm",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The class 'AuthManager' initializes with standard HTTP headers for JSON content. It sets up an empty cookie dictionary and a token variable initialized to None. There are no suspicious behaviors, no external data reads, no sensitive data handling beyond standard session setup. The code does not include any network communication, data leakage, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard setup for managing authentication state in an HTTP-based application. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
