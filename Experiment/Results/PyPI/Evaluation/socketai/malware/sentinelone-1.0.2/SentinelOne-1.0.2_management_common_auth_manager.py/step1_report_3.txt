  "purpose": "Initialize an authentication manager with HTTP headers, cookies, and a token placeholder.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where data could flow to cause data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes attributes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The class defines an __init__ method that sets up headers with a fixed content-type, initializes an empty cookies dictionary, and sets token to None. No data input, output, or external communication is implemented in this snippet. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for an authentication manager without any signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard class constructor for managing authentication-related data. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
