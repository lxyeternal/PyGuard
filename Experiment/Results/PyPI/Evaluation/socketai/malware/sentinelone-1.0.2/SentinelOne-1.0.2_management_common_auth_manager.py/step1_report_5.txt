  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and tokens for HTTP requests",
  "sources": "None explicitly; class attributes are initialized but no input reading occurs in the snippet",
  "sinks": "None in this code snippet; no data flows to external systems or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows identified in this minimal snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for setting up an auth manager",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'AuthManager' with an __init__ method that initializes headers, cookies, and token attributes. No external data reading, no suspicious or unusual operations, no hardcoded credentials beyond standard headers, and no code execution or network activity present in this snippet. The code appears to be a simple, standard setup for an authentication handler without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic, benign code snippet for initializing an authentication manager. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues based on the provided code.",
