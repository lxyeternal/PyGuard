  "purpose": "This code implements a client for interacting with a marketplace API, providing methods to query, install, update, enable/disable, and delete applications and configurations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as query_filter, app_catalog_id, app_id, ids, configurations, and other kwargs used in API request methods.",
  "sinks": "API request endpoints where untrusted data (parameters, IDs, configurations) are sent; response handling where data is processed or returned.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API request parameters; responses are checked for status codes; data is processed or returned; exceptions are raised on errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client wrapper with methods for CRUD operations on marketplace applications. It constructs query parameters from input filters, performs HTTP requests, checks response status, and raises exceptions on failure. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flows are present. The use of external constants and functions appears standard. The security posture is minimal risk, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and risk score (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
