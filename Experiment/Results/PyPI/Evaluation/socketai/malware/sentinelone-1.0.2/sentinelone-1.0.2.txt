      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe query filter utility with proper validation and transformation logic. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score of 0.1 are justified and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious behaviors, warranting cautious scoring. The adjusted malware score for Report 5 to 0.6 aligns with the observed patterns. Other reports are benign or lack sufficient evidence of malicious activity. Overall, the dependency poses a moderate security concern, primarily due to obfuscation and network activity, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a moderate security risk due to unvalidated system command execution, which could be exploited for command injection. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score of 0.6 is justified given the described pattern. Proper input validation and sanitization are recommended to mitigate this risk."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK extension with a single dynamic call to api.run(). There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary risk is if api is compromised, which is unlikely given its import path. The malware score should be low (around 0.1-0.2), and the overall security risk remains moderate due to the potential for external code execution. Verification of the api module's integrity is recommended."

      "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static collection of API endpoint URL patterns with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only potential security concern relates to the handling of placeholders during URL formatting elsewhere in the system. Proper input validation and sanitization in the usage context will mitigate this risk."
