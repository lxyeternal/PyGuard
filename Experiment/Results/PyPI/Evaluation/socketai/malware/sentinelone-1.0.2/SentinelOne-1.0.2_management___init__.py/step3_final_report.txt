  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers and levels based on environment variables, with default paths and levels, to set up application logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; platform info via sys.platform; tempfile.gettempdir() for default log path.",
  "sinks": "Log file written to path determined by environment variables or default; logs output to stdout via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log path and level; handlers write logs to file and stdout; no untrusted data processed beyond configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is standard; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; potential for misconfiguration if environment variables are maliciously set, but no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers with configurable log file path and level, defaulting to system temp directories and 'debug' level. It uses environment variables to allow customization, which is common practice. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no network activity or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python logging practices. No suspicious functions or malicious patterns are present. Potential risks relate to environment variable misconfiguration, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The code's structure and logic are clear, with no anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with configurable parameters via environment variables. No malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is negligible, primarily related to potential misconfiguration, but not malicious activity.",
