  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers with dynamic log level and log file path, primarily for debugging and monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' influence log configuration; gettempdir() determines default log file location.",
  "sinks": "Log data is written to a file specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH' or default path, and output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to determine log file path and level; these values influence the setup of file and stream handlers which output logs accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no insecure operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers based on environment variables, allowing configurable log level and output location. It uses standard Python logging features without any insecure or malicious constructs. The log file location is derived from environment variables but is restricted to typical temporary directories, minimizing risk. No external network or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured configuration logic with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It dynamically configures log outputs based on environment variables, which is typical for flexible logging setups in applications.",
