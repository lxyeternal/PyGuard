  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers with dynamic log file path and level based on environment variables",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH' and 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL' for log file location and level, and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' for enabling handlers",
  "sinks": "None directly; logging outputs to file and stdout, but no untrusted data flows identified",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log configuration, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks beyond logging setup",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for log configuration is standard; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a logger, determines log file path based on environment variables, sets log level, and adds handlers for logging output. It reads environment variables to determine the log path and level but does not handle or process any untrusted data beyond configuration. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The logging setup appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging configuration setup with environment-driven parameters. No malicious activity, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks are identified. It is safe and intended for flexible logging configuration.",
