  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the SDK, setting log level and log file path based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform detection; temporary directory path.",
  "sinks": "Log file written to 'mgmt_sdk.log' in the temporary directory; logs output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and file path; log messages are formatted and output to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard logging setup with environment variable customization.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers with configurable log level and file path via environment variables. It uses standard Python modules (os, sys, tempfile, logging). The log file path defaults to a temporary directory based on platform. The log level defaults to 'debug' if an invalid value is provided. Handlers are attached to a logger named 'MgmtSdk'. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging setup script that dynamically configures log handlers based on environment variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
