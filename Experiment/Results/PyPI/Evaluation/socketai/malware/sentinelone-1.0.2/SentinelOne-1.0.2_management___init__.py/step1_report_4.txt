  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for a management SDK, setting log file path and level based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform information; temporary directory for log file.",
  "sinks": "Log data written to file at 'SDK_LOG_PATH' or default location; log output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and file path; logging handlers output data to files and stdout; no untrusted input directly processed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to set log file path could potentially be exploited to write logs to unintended locations if misconfigured, but no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging handlers with configurable log level and file path. It dynamically determines the log file location based on environment variables, which is common in configurable systems. The code does not process untrusted input beyond reading environment variables and system info, nor does it include any code execution or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code's security risk mainly depends on environment variable trustworthiness, but it does not inherently pose a malicious threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup that relies on environment variables for configuration. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators are present. It is a benign configuration snippet with configurable file paths and log levels.",
