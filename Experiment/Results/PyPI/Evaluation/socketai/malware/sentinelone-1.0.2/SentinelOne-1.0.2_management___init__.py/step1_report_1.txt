  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers and log levels based on environment variables for the MgmtSdk module.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform info; temporary directory.",
  "sinks": "Log file at a configurable path; stdout for logs.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log file path and log level; log handlers output to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; environment variable usage is standard; no suspicious code execution or obfuscated code; no data exfiltration or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up logging configurations, determining the log file location from environment variables or defaults, and sets log levels likewise based on environment variables. It uses standard Python modules without any suspicious functions or data handling. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The use of environment variables for configuration is typical and not malicious. The code appears to be safe and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard logging setup with configurable parameters via environment variables. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical implementation for logging configuration.",
