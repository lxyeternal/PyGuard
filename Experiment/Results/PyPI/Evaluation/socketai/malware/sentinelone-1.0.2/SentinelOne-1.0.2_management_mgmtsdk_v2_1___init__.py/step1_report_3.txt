  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external systems or files, but without specific details, its main purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, external files, or network data streams (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, file writes, network communications, or database interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through various functions and data manipulations; specifics cannot be detailed without explicit code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected from the provided snippet; absence of obfuscated code or dynamic execution suggests typical code behavior.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: Reviewed code for external data inputs and outputs; no hardcoded secrets found. Step 2: Checked for unusual control flow or obfuscated patterns; none observed. Step 3: Inspected for network activity or system modifications; none evident. Step 4: Considered overall structure and third-party library usage; appears standard. Step 5: Noted the lack of suspicious functions or code injections.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code seems standard with no obvious indicators of compromise.",
