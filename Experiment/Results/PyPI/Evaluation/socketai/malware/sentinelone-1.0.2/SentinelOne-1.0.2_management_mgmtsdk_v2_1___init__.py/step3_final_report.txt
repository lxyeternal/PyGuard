{
  "purpose": "The code executes system commands based on environment variables or user input without sanitization, posing a command injection risk.",
  "sources": "Environment variables and user input used in system command execution functions such as os.system or subprocess without validation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands with untrusted input, potentially leading to command injection or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment variables or user input flows directly into system command execution functions without sanitization or validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables or user input directly in system calls without validation; no input sanitization observed.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on environment variables or user input to construct system commands and executes them directly. This pattern is vulnerable to command injection if inputs are untrusted. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident. The risk stems from executing unvalidated external data, which could be exploited to run arbitrary commands. No malware or malicious behavior is detected, but the potential for exploitation is significant if input validation is absent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a moderate security risk due to unvalidated system command execution, which could be exploited for command injection. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score of 0.6 is justified given the described pattern. Proper input validation and sanitization are recommended to mitigate this risk.",
