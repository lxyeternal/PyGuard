  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a moderate security risk due to unvalidated system command execution, which could be exploited for command injection. No malware or obfuscation is present. The risk score of 0.6 is justified given the described pattern. Proper input validation and sanitization are recommended to mitigate this risk."
