{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for constructing and applying query filters for API requests, with support for different scope filters.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method arguments such as filter arguments, query filter objects, and string splitting operations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable areas include raising exceptions with formatted messages (but not inherently dangerous), and applying filters which could process untrusted input data if used improperly elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input filter args are split and validated in SplittedHelper, then applied via apply() to build filter dictionaries; these are later retrieved via get_query_params.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code appears straightforward, with proper exception handling. No unusual or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to build query filters with validation, transformation, and scope-specific subclasses. It performs input validation and raises specific exceptions for invalid filters or operators. The logic is typical for filter construction and does not contain hidden or obfuscated code. No external calls, system modifications, or network interactions are present. No signs of malware or malicious payloads. The usage of exception messages for invalid inputs is standard and does not pose security issues. Overall, the implementation looks safe and intended for legitimate filtering purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filter-building utility with no indications of malicious behavior. It correctly handles validation and transformation, with no suspicious activity or malware detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily involving proper usage in a larger context. Confidence is high that this code is safe and non-malicious.",
