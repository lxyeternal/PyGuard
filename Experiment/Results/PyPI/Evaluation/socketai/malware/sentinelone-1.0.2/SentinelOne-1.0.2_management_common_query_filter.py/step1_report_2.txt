{
  "purpose": "The code defines a framework for constructing, validating, and transforming query filters for API calls, supporting various scope filters and operators.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as key, val, and filter_args, and from class attributes like QUERY_ARGS. No external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs filter dictionaries and transformed query strings that could be used in API calls. No direct data leaks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (filter_args or query_filter) are processed to build internal filter representations, which are then transformed into query parameter dictionaries for API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The code performs standard validation and transformation of query parameters. The only unusual aspect is the dynamic modification of QUERY_ARGS in the constructor, which is a benign pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a query filter system with validation, transformation, and scope filtering classes. It uses standard exception handling and string manipulation. No external network calls, system modifications, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be well-structured for its purpose, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. It uses common programming constructs and handles input validation appropriately. There are no indicators of malware, data exfiltration, or harmful activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate query filtering utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It focuses solely on building and validating API query parameters. The implementation is clear and adheres to standard patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
