{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and enums for constructing, validating, and transforming query filters for an API, including scope filters with specific allowed parameters.",
  "sources": "Initialization of filter parameters, application of filters via the 'apply' method, and the 'get_query_params' method processing filter arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'apply' method potentially modifies 'self.filters', and 'get_query_params' returns a dictionary representing query parameters; no evident dangerous sinks handling untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input filter arguments are split and processed by 'SplittedHelper', then applied via 'apply' to 'self.filters'. 'get_query_params' either returns existing filter data or constructs filters from kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code performs standard query filtering logic. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes to construct and validate query filters with allowed operators. It performs validation and transforms filters into API-compatible strings. No unsafe or malicious behavior is apparent. The code does not execute untrusted data in a way that would cause harm, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious logic. It relies on exception raising for invalid input validation, which is standard. No network calls, file operations, or other malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of query filter handling with validation and transformation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely safe and intended for building API query parameters.",
