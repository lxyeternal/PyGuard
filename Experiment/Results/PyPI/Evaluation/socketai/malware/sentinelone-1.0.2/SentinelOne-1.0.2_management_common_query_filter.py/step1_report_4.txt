{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of classes for constructing, validating, and transforming query filters used in API calls, supporting various filtering scopes and operators.",
  "sources": "Reads input through method parameters (e.g., apply, get_query_params), environment variables are not used, no external data sources accessed.",
  "sinks": "Filters are stored internally; no direct data leaks or external system interactions are evident. No output or network code present.",
  "flows": "Input data from method arguments flows into filter application and transformation methods, resulting in internal filter dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic string manipulation for query transformations, but this is standard for query building. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs query filter objects with predefined allowed fields and operators, applying validation and transformations. The class hierarchy supports different filter scopes. No suspicious code or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward and consistent with safe filter construction. No external system calls or sensitive data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of query filtering classes with validation and transformation logic. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The design is typical for API query parameter handling, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
