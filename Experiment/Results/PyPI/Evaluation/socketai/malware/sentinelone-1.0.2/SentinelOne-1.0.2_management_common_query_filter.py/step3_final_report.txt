  "purpose": "Defines classes for constructing and validating query filters with scope-specific subclasses, enabling safe and structured query parameter management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods such as 'apply' and 'get_query_params', class attributes like QUERY_ARGS, and method arguments like filter_args.",
  "sinks": "Internal filter dictionaries storing validated filter conditions; no external data leaks or network/file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters into validation, transformation, and storage within internal filter dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Dynamic modification of QUERY_ARGS in constructors is benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical query filter utility with validation, transformation, and scope-specific subclasses. It performs standard validation, including operator checks and field restrictions, and transforms filter keys for API compatibility. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic modification of QUERY_ARGS in constructors is a common pattern for extending filter capabilities. Exception handling is appropriate, and the code is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe query filter utility with proper validation and transformation logic. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low security risk score of 0.1 are justified and appropriate.",
