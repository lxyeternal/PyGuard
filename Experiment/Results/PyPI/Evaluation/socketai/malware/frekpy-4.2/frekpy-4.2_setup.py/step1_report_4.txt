  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python module named 'frekpy' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, description, author info, download URL, and dependencies from predefined variables within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or code execution based on external input.",
  "flows": "The setup parameters are static; no data flows from external sources to sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration using distutils, containing only static package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling. The download URL is a standard GitHub link to a release archive. No embedded code, network operations, or secret handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a normal setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
