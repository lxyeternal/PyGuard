  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata and dependencies for the 'frekpy' library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static metadata fields such as name, version, author, download URL, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code execution, network operations, or dynamic code handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using distutils, containing only static metadata. No dynamic code, user input, or network activity is present. The external download URL is standard for package distribution but could be a supply chain vector if compromised; however, the script itself does not perform any download or execution. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The minor risk associated with the external URL is acknowledged but does not reflect malicious intent in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package configuration script with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The external URL dependency poses minimal risk as it is not actively used by the script. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
