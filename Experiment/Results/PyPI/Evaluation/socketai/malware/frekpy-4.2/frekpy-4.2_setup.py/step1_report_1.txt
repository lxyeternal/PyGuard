  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging of the 'frekpy' Python library for distribution",
  "sources": "None explicitly, as this script only sets package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code is purely configuration-based",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward setup configuration without obfuscated or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The script imports distutils.core.setup to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It does not process or handle input data or perform any runtime logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The install_requires includes 'requests', which is a common library and not suspicious in this context. The commented-out license line does not affect execution. The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior or malware indications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
