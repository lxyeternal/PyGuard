{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'frekpy' package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, author, description, dependencies) from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data output or network interactions in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this script only sets up package info and dependencies, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden code. Usage of 'distutils' is outdated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'distutils.core' to configure package setup parameters. It specifies package name, version, description, author info, download URL, required dependencies, and classifiers. There are no code execution, data input, or network interactions beyond static metadata. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script defining package metadata for distribution, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
