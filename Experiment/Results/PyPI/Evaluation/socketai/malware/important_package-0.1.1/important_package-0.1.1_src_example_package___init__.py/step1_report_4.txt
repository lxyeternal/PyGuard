  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, user directory, current working directory), encode it in base64, and send it via an HTTP request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "os.uname, os.path.expanduser, os.getcwd",
  "sinks": "request.urlopen (HTTP request to external URL)",
  "flows": "System info gathered from sources -> encoded in base64 -> appended as URL parameter -> sent via HTTP request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Use of try_call to suppress exceptions, potentially hiding errors; sending system info to an external domain; custom Host header; no validation or sanitization of data; hardcoded URL and host header.",
  "analysis": "The script collects basic system info such as hostname, user directory, and current working directory, then encodes this data in base64 and sends it to an external URL (https://pypi.org/reqs?d=...). The try_call function suppresses errors, which may hide malicious or unintended issues. The external request includes a custom Host header that does not match the URL domain, which could be an attempt to evade detection or mimic trusted traffic. The purpose appears to be exfiltrating system information, which poses privacy concerns. No malicious code execution, system damage, or payload delivery is evident, but the data collection and transmission pattern is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign system info collection but transmits this data to an external server with a suspicious request structure and obfuscated error handling. It does not contain direct malware or malicious payload, but the privacy violation and data exfiltration behavior are concerning.",
