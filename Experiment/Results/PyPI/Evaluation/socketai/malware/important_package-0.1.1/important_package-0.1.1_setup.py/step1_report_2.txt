  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup using setuptools, including reading a README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No direct sink of untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or harmful actions present",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting package configuration parameters",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward package setup process",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a local README.md file for the package's long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies include 'dnspython', which is a standard third-party package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard package setup configuration without any malicious intent or security issues. It reads a description file and specifies package metadata and dependencies safely.",
