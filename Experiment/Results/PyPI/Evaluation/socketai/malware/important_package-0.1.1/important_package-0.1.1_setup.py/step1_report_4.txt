  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure the packaging of a Python project, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads local file content and passes static data to setuptools.setup; no flow of untrusted data to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a README file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters. The dependencies listed are standard (dnspython). There are no suspicious code behaviors, no dynamic code execution, and no untrusted data handling. The code appears to be a typical, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It follows common patterns and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
