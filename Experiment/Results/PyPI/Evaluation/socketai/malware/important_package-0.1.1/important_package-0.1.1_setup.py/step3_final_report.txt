  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, reading README.md for long description and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; static parameters in setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data handling; no network or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Reading local file to variable, then passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or malicious code. It reads a local README file and configures package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All signals indicate benign, standard packaging code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify it as safe. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in report 5 is unwarranted; it should be adjusted to 0.",
