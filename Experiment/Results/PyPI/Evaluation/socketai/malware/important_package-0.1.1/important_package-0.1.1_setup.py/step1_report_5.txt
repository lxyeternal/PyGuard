  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup using setuptools, including reading the README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file; package setup parameters such as name, version, author, description, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input data; no code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file (source) used for long_description; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup using setuptools, reading a README.md file for the long description, and specifying dependencies and metadata. No external input is processed during setup beyond reading a static file. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. All parameters and dependencies appear normal and appropriate for a typical package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
