{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and configure a Python package named 'Metrical' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The package setup configuration, including the 'install_requires' list of dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the dependencies or setup process could be misused to include malicious packages or execute malicious code, but none are inherently malicious in this context.",
  "flows": "The setup script installs specified packages; malicious behavior could occur if the dependencies are compromised, but the script itself does not execute any untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code injection, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies required for the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The dependencies listed are common and not suspicious by themselves. The empty author fields might indicate incomplete metadata but are not malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply declares package metadata and dependencies.",
