  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'Metrical' Python project.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input or data; the code primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; dependencies include common libraries, but 'browser_cookie3' and 'robloxpy' could be potentially sensitive or privacy-related, though their usage here is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data leaks, no suspicious code patterns, and no malicious behavior evident. The dependencies include libraries that interact with web content and cookies, which could raise privacy considerations if misused, but in this context, they are simply dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behaviors. The inclusion of certain dependencies warrants awareness of their privacy implications but is not inherently malicious.",
