{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'Metrical' with specified dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, author, email) and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data output or external communication is directly invoked.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are installed via standard setup.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields are unusual but not malicious; dependencies include 'browser_cookie3' and 'discordwebhook', which could be used for user tracking or external communication but are common in benign contexts.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is straightforward, using setuptools to configure the package. No code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. Dependencies are typical but include libraries that can be used for cookie access and webhooks, which could be used maliciously if combined with additional code, but within this snippet, there's no malicious activity. The script contains no input handling, no data leaks, or backdoors. Overall, the code appears benign, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and appears safe. While some dependencies could potentially be misused in a broader context, this code fragment itself does not contain malicious behavior or security issues.",
