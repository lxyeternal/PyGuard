  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'Metrical', including dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'install_requires' list specifying external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Dependencies are installed; no direct sink of untrusted data or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Installation process pulls in listed packages, but no untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields; no suspicious code or hardcoded credentials present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependencies listed are common for web and gaming-related functionalities but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines package dependencies for installation.",
