  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'Metrical', specifying its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read from the import statements, the version variable, and the setup() function call with its parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly include sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining package metadata and dependencies; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields are unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no input handling. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests', which are common in many applications. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup conventions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dependencies are typical and do not suggest any malicious activity. Overall, the code appears safe.",
