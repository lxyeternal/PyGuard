  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package named 'Metrical'. It only defines metadata and dependencies, with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscated or malicious logic.\n- The only anomalies are empty `author` and `author_email` fields, which are not malicious but perhaps incomplete.\n\n**Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly note the presence of dependencies like `browser_cookie3`, `discordwebhook`, `robloxpy`, and `requests`, which are common but could be misused in malicious contexts.\n- The assessments appropriately assign low security risk scores, given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal concern about dependencies, which is reasonable.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 or 1.0), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores**\n\n- Since there's no actual malicious activity, high risk scores (>0.5) are unwarranted.\n- The dependency list includes libraries that could be misused (e.g., `browser_cookie3`, `discordwebhook`), but their mere presence doesn't imply malicious intent.\n- Therefore, the assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Step 5: Address potential assumptions**\n\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent, focusing instead on the code's structure.\n- They correctly note that dependencies could be misused but do not assume malicious behavior from the code itself.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — Slight concern due to dependencies but overall low risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal concern about dependencies but no actual risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, and the dependency choices are common but should be monitored in broader contexts. No changes needed to the scores or analysis.",
