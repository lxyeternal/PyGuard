  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'Metrical' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields and the dependencies list in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the script only defines static package info.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields are unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious code. Dependencies are common libraries that could be misused but are not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious logic detected. The minimal risk score (0.1) reflects potential privacy or misuse concerns associated with dependencies, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight risk score accounts for the nature of dependencies but does not indicate active threats.",
