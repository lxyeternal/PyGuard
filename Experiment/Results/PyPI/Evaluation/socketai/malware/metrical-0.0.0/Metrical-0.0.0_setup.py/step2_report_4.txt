  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for the 'Metrical' package, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- The only anomalies noted are the empty 'author' and 'author_email' fields, which are unusual but not malicious.\n- The dependencies listed include libraries like 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests', which are common but could be misused in malicious contexts, though this is not evidenced here.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets match the description; no code injection, backdoors, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- **Malicious indicators:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Dependencies:** Common libraries; no evidence that their inclusion is malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** Empty author fields are noted but are not malicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n- The risk scores assigned are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Scoring justification:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, justified by the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All zero, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) due to missing author info and dependencies that could be misused in a different context, but overall low.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate; minimal risk, standard setup script)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation, and the minimal security risk stems from dependencies that could be misused if combined with malicious code elsewhere, but in this context, it’s negligible.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the actual code content.",
