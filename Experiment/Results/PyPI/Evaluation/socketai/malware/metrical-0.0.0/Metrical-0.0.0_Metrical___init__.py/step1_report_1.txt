    "Heavy use of eval() on decoded data, which is a common sign of malicious obfuscation",

    "No clear benign functionality or purpose; focus on obfuscation and code execution"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is heavily obfuscated with multiple layers of base64 decoding, string decoding, and eval() execution. It appears to read encoded payloads, decode them, and execute the resulting code. The use of multiple nested decoding functions and the conversion of seemingly random strings into executable code strongly suggest an intent to conceal malicious activity, such as code injection, remote command execution, or data exfiltration. The initial imports and variable assignments do not seem to serve any meaningful benign purpose but are instead designed to hide the actual payload. Overall, the code's structure and behavior are consistent with malicious obfuscation tactics aimed at executing concealed payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its heavy obfuscation, multiple layers of decoding, and use of eval() on dynamically decoded data. It likely attempts to execute malicious payloads hidden within encoded strings, representing a high risk for malicious activity such as system compromise or data theft. The obfuscation makes it difficult to determine the precise payload, but the intent and techniques strongly indicate malicious behavior.",
