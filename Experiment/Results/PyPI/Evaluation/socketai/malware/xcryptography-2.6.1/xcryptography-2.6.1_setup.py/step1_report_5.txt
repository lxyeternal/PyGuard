{
  "purpose": "To configure the packaging and distribution of the 'xcryptography' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with package metadata; no external data inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code only initiates a package setup process.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no source-to-sink data flows; the code executes setup functions without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and invokes the 'setup' function with static package name and version. It uses 'find_packages()' to automatically discover packages within the directory. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It does not read external input, perform network operations, or include malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
