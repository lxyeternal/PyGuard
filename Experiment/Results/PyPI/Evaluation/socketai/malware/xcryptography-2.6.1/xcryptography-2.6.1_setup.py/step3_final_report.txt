  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'xcryptography' module.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static package parameters in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters. It performs no dynamic code execution, data processing, or obfuscation. The package name 'xcryptography' may resemble 'cryptography', raising potential impersonation concerns, but the code itself is benign. All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script with no malicious behavior. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero; security risk is minimal, with a slight note on the package name's resemblance to a known library, but no actual security flaw exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only concern is the package name, which could be used for impersonation, but this does not reflect in the code's behavior or security risk. Scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
