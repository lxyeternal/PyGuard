{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and package a Python project named 'xcryptography' with version 2.6.1 using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package information, including package name, version, and package list via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks are present; the setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only executes package metadata definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with fixed parameters for name, version, and packages. This is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, nor any indication of malicious behavior. The code appears to be straightforward, standard packaging code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. No anomalies are observed.",
