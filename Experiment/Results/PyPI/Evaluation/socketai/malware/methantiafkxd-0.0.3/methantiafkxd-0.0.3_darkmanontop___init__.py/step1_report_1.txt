{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious data stealer and infostealer targeting browsers, Discord tokens, and other sensitive data, while also exfiltrating files, taking screenshots, and spying on user activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads user data from browser storage (Chrome, Opera, Yandex, Brave, Edge), cookies, login data, history, credit cards, and other browser artifacts; it also accesses local files on desktop, downloads external scripts, reads environment variables, and captures screenshots.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data, including tokens, cookies, passwords, and files, via webhooks to a Discord URL; it also uploads files to anonymous file hosting services, exfiltrates screenshots, and posts data through HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser databases, local files, and clipboard data flow into decryption functions, then into network requests to exfiltrate tokens, cookies, passwords, and files; external scripts are fetched and injected into Discord process directories; screenshots and files are zipped and sent to webhooks; token validation requests also connect to Discord's API.",
  "anomalies": "The script includes self-installation mechanisms, disabling debug checks, hiding windows, forcibly killing security processes, injecting scripts into Discord, collecting extensive system info, and obfuscating data with unusual string manipulations. It hardcodes webhook URLs, contains redundant import/install code, and performs aggressive process termination (e.g., taskkill). It also executes external commands with subprocess, and loads external scripts from GitHub URLs, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates multiple malicious behaviors: it exfiltrates browser credentials, cookies, history, credit card info, and saved passwords; it scans user directories for sensitive files; it captures screenshots; it injects scripts into Discord's directories; it kills security-related processes; it collects system info and user environment data; it posts all data to a Discord webhook; it also uploads files to anonymous hosts. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, external script fetching, process termination, and extensive data collection without user consent confirm malicious intent. The code also attempts to disable or hide itself, making it difficult to detect and remove.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious, data-stealing trojan designed for covertly exfiltrating sensitive user information, including credentials, cookies, browsing history, and files, via webhooks and external uploads. It contains multiple indicators of sabotage, privacy violation, and malware behavior, making it dangerous for any targeted system. It is strongly recommended to consider this package unsafe and block or quarantine it.",
