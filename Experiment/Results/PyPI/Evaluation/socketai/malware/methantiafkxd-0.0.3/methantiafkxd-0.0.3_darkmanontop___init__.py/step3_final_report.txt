{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting browser credentials, cookies, Discord tokens, system information, and cryptocurrency wallet addresses. It exfiltrates data via webhooks, uploads files to anonymous file hosts, injects malicious scripts into Discord desktop processes, and employs anti-debugging and process termination tactics to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Sources include browser data directories (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Firefox), Discord local storage, leveldb files, cookies, history, credit card info, system info via subprocess calls, clipboard, and local environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration occurs through Discord webhooks, file uploads, and network requests. Data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and wallet addresses are collected and sent externally. External scripts are fetched and injected into Discord processes. Files are created, zipped, and uploaded to anonymous hosts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local browser and system data directories to in-memory variables, then to exfiltration channels via HTTP requests, webhook posts, and file uploads. External scripts are downloaded and injected into Discord processes. Process termination commands are issued to kill security tools. Data decryption routines process encrypted credentials before exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, external script fetching from GitHub, process termination commands for security tools, obfuscated or misleading variable names, redundant code, and stealth tactics like process hiding and anti-debugging checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to harvest sensitive user data including browser passwords, cookies, tokens, system info, and cryptocurrency addresses. It employs multiple techniques to evade detection, such as process killing, process hiding, external script injection, and minimal obfuscation. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads files to anonymous hosts. The routines for decryption and data collection are standard for info-stealers, with some redundant or misleading code segments. The presence of hardcoded webhooks, external script URLs, and process sabotage indicates high malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious info-stealer with capabilities for credential theft, token harvesting, system info exfiltration, and stealth operations. It employs external script injection, process sabotage, and data exfiltration channels, confirming its severe security threat. The overall behavior warrants a malware score of 1, a high security risk, and moderate obfuscation due to some misleading variable names and minimal obfuscation tactics.",
