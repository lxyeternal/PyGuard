{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data collection, including theft of sensitive information such as passwords, cookies, tokens, and system information, and exfiltration via webhooks to Discord. It also includes capabilities for user activity monitoring, process termination, and file searching for sensitive files.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, TEMP), local files (e.g., browser Local State files, login databases, cookies, history), clipboard data, process listings, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through POST requests to Discord webhooks, including file uploads (screenshots, passwords, cookies, tokens), and direct network requests for token harvesting and data submission.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from file reads (browser databases, cookies, history), clipboard data, and network responses into memory, then to webhook POST requests, often after processing or decrypting. Files are read, decrypted, and then uploaded or sent as attachments.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple indications of malicious intent include code that searches for and exfiltrates passwords, cookies, tokens, history, credit card info; code that terminates processes related to security tools; code that searches user directories for sensitive files; code that decrypts browser data; code that loads and executes external scripts; obfuscated or redundant code segments; the inclusion of multiple webhooks; and active system information gathering aimed at tracking or targeting users.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily focused on gathering sensitive user data from various browsers and applications, decrypting stored credentials and cookies, and sending this data via Discord webhooks. It also searches for specific files, terminates security-related processes, and runs system checks to identify virtualized or analysis environments. The presence of functions for decrypting data, collecting system info, and exfiltrating files confirms malicious intent. The code also contains redundant imports, obfuscation tactics, and potential anti-debugging measures, all characteristic of malware or malicious data stealers.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is highly malicious, designed for data theft, system reconnaissance, process termination of security tools, and exfiltration of sensitive information. It contains numerous indicators of malicious behavior, including data exfiltration via Discord webhooks, decryption routines for stored browser credentials, and active surveillance of user files and processes. Its structure and activities confirm a supply chain malicious payload aimed at compromising user privacy and security.",
