{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive information such as browser data (passwords, cookies, history), system information, IP details, and Discord tokens. It then exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks and uploads files to anonymous hosting services. Additionally, it can manipulate clipboard data to replace cryptocurrency addresses with configured ones, and injects code into Discord desktop app modules, indicating malicious intent to steal user credentials and tokens.",
  "sources": "Reading from browser data files (Local Storage, LevelDB, Cookies, History, Credit Cards), environment variables, system commands, clipboard, files on Desktop/Downloads/Documents, process list, registry keys, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks, uploading files to transfer.sh and anonfiles.com, writing sensitive data to local files, modifying browser files and Discord modules, and clipboard manipulation.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser data files, environment variables, and system commands feed data into parsing functions. Extracted tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info are stored and then sent through webhook posts or uploaded files. Code injection into Discord modules manipulates browser/Discord data, while clipboard swaps crypto addresses. File operations are used to gather and send sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or misleading variable names, redundant imports, excessive use of threading, and injection of code into Discord modules. The code harvests tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info without user consent, uploads data to third-party servers, manipulates clipboard contents, and injects external scripts. It also kills processes associated with debugging or analysis tools, indicating anti-debugging/anti-analysis measures. The presence of malicious code for exfiltration and data theft is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing many modules and establishing environment paths. It performs data exfiltration by sending browser passwords, cookies, history, credit cards, and screenshots via webhook or upload services. It injects scripts into Discord module directories for persistence or further exploitation. It collects Discord tokens, system info, IP geolocation, and browser data. The code uses threading to parallelize data collection, and employs obfuscation techniques like misleading variable names and code injection. Anti-debugging checks are present to avoid analysis. It manipulates clipboard data to replace cryptocurrency addresses, likely for theft. The code also checks for virtual machine indicators and running debugging tools to evade detection. Overall, the code is designed for stealthy data theft, credential harvesting, and remote exfiltration, with multiple anti-analysis measures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious. It collects sensitive user data (credentials, tokens, cookies, system info), injects scripts into Discord, manipulates clipboard content for cryptocurrency theft, and exfiltrates all gathered data via webhooks and file uploads. Anti-debugging and process-killing measures suggest it aims to avoid detection. It fits the profile of a comprehensive info-stealer and data exfiltration malware.",
