The only concern is the suspicious package name and vague description, which could be used maliciously outside this context. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, risk=0.2 to reflect the naming suspicion without evidence of malicious code."

      "conclusion": "This code is a highly malicious info-stealer with capabilities for credential theft, token harvesting, system info exfiltration, and stealth operations. It employs external script injection, process sabotage, and data exfiltration channels, confirming its severe security threat. The overall behavior warrants a malware score of 1, a high security risk, and moderate obfuscation due to some misleading variable names and minimal obfuscation tactics."
