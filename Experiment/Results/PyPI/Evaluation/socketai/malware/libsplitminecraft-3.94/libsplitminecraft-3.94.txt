      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, stealthily executed PowerShell code referencing a suspicious URL, indicating high likelihood of malicious intent. The setup process appears legitimate but is preceded by potentially malicious payload execution. Given the obfuscation, silent execution, and suspicious URL, the overall security risk is high. Decoding the payload would be necessary for definitive confirmation, but current evidence warrants a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.85."
