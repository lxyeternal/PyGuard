{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and files, then exfiltrate them to an external server, likely for malicious or unauthorized surveillance.",
  "sources": "System directories (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/), system hostname and username, specific files (/root/j0j0.poc, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts, /run/docker.sock)",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests sending data to https://j0j0.xyz, including sensitive system files and environment info",
  "flows": "Reads system info and files -> sends data via requests.post to external server",
  "anomalies": "Exfiltration of multiple system directories and files, including Docker-specific files, upon installation; no clear benign purpose; hardcoded URL; collection of potentially sensitive data",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the installation process of a Python package, then collects various system directories and specific files that may contain sensitive information or environment details. It then sends this data to an external server hosted at j0j0.xyz. The code also attempts to create a file in /root, possibly as a marker. The external URL and the nature of the collected data suggest malicious intent, likely for data theft or reconnaissance. The use of standard libraries and the absence of obfuscation do not mitigate the malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and appears malicious, designed to exfiltrate system information and sensitive files without user consent. It leverages the package installation process to secretly gather data and send it to an attacker-controlled server.",
