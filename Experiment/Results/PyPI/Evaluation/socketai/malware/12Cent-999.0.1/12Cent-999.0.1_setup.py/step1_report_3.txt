{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed to collect system information and files, then exfiltrate them to an external server, likely for malicious purposes such as spying or data theft.",
  "sources": "System directories (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/), files (/root/j0j0.poc, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts, /run/docker.sock), user input (hostname, username)",
  "sinks": "Requests POST calls to https://j0j0.xyz/ with collected data and files, sending potentially sensitive data over the network",
  "flows": "Reads system info and files (sources) then sends this data via HTTP POST requests to external server (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URL 'https://j0j0.xyz/', writing a file to root '/', attempting to open sensitive files like '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', and '/run/docker.sock', which are typically used to detect container or environment info, and exfiltrate them",
  "analysis": "The code extends setuptools' install command to perform malicious data collection during package installation. It gathers directory listings from common system paths, possibly to identify environment details. It reads specific files associated with Docker or container environments and sends all collected data to an external server under suspicious URL. The code also creates a file in root directory (/root/j0j0.poc), which may be a marker or a backdoor indicator. The use of requests to POST sensitive environment info and files indicates malicious intent to exfiltrate data. No obfuscation detected; code structure is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It performs system reconnaissance and exfiltrates sensitive data, including environment details and specific files, to an external server without user consent. The design suggests a backdoor or data theft capability embedded in a package intended for malicious purposes.",
