{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform custom installation procedures that include collecting system information, listing directory contents, and exfiltrating data from specific system files and sockets to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, username, directory listings (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/), and contents of specific files (/root/.wget-hsts, /.dockerenv, /run/docker.sock). It also reads from system files and sockets (docker socket, hidden files).",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via HTTP POST requests to a suspicious external domain ('https://j0j0.xyz/...'). Files like /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts, and /run/docker.sock are read and sent over the network.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory listings) is gathered and sent to remote server. Additionally, contents of sensitive files and sockets are read and exfiltrated through POST requests, potentially leaking sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects environment info and directory listings, then exfiltrates these to a suspicious domain. It reads Docker environment files and socket files, which are often used for malicious data extraction or reverse engineering. The code also creates a file '/.dockerenv' as a payload marker but does not write to it, possibly indicating stealth tactics.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the 'install' command in setuptools to perform malicious activities during package installation. It gathers system info (hostname, username, directory lists), and attempts to send this info to an external server. It also reads sensitive system files and Docker socket files, and uploads their contents, which could include secrets, tokens, or other sensitive data. The code uses requests to POST data to a suspicious URL, which indicates potential data exfiltration. The code does not perform any benign or standard setup tasks besides this malicious activity. The obfuscation is minimal; the code is straightforward but performs malicious data collection and exfiltration during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate sensitive system information and files to an external malicious domain during package installation. It exhibits clear signs of malicious intent, including data collection from sensitive files and environment, and exfiltration via HTTP requests. It should be considered highly dangerous and should not be used.",
