{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by collecting system info, environment indicators, and sensitive files, then sending them to a suspicious external server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, username, directory listings (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/), and specific files (/root/.wget-hsts, /.dockerenv, /run/docker.sock). Opens and reads files for exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to https://j0j0.xyz/ with collected data and files, leading to external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, files) are collected and then sent via requests.post() to the external server, completing the data exfiltration pipeline during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Creates a file /root/j0j0.poc without clear benign purpose; exfiltration occurs during package install; reads sensitive Docker environment files; no obfuscation; contacts suspicious domain.",
  "analysis": "The code executes during package installation, collecting hostname, username, directory listings, and specific sensitive files. It sends this data to a malicious server via HTTP POST requests. It creates a marker file in /root. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs malicious exfiltration stealthily. All signals indicate malicious intent, including environment reconnaissance and data theft. The exfiltration of sensitive files and environment info during installation is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, designed for covert data exfiltration during package installation. It reads sensitive environment indicators and files, then transmits them to a suspicious external server. The activity poses a high security risk and should be classified with maximum malware and risk scores.",
