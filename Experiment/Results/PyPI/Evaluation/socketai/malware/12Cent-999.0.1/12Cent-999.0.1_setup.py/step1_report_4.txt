{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious Python package designed to exfiltrate system information and files during installation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include system directories (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/), system files (/root/.wget-hsts, /.dockerenv, /run/docker.sock), and system details (hostname, username).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to https://j0j0.xyz/ with collected system information, files, and potentially sensitive data.",
  "flows": "System data from directories and files (sources) are collected and posted to external server URLs (sinks), forming source-to-sink data exfiltration flows during the custom install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently attempts to create a file (/root/j0j0.poc), reads sensitive files (/root/.wget-hsts, docker socket), and sends this data over the network. It also gathers environment information without user consent and hides activity within the install script.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install process of a Python package to execute additional malicious actions. It collects system directory listings and specific files, then exfiltrates this data to an external server, indicating malicious intent. The use of hardcoded URLs, silent file operations, and data transmission during package installation strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at stealthy information theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed for covert data exfiltration during package installation. It collects system information and sensitive files, transmitting them to an external server without user consent, representing a significant security threat.",
