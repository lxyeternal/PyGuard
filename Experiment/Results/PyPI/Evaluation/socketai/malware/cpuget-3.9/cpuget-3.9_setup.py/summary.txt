  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to the execution of an obfuscated, silently run PowerShell command during package setup. While the payload's content remains unknown, the techniques used are characteristic of malicious activity. The current high scores are justified; further decoding of the payload is necessary for confirmation."
