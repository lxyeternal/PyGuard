      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered conditionally, representing a significant security threat. The setup code appears benign but is overshadowed by the malicious activity. The high obfuscation, external URL, and silent error handling strongly suggest malicious intent. Scores in the reports are justified; this package should be treated as malicious until further decoding confirms benignity."
