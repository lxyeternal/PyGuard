  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior in the setup script, focusing on obfuscated PowerShell command execution during package installation.",
  "sources": "The conditional check for 'tahg' directory and the subprocess.Popen call executing the encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the encoded PowerShell command, which could perform malicious actions such as downloading payloads, establishing reverse shells, or exfiltrating data.",
  "flows": "Code checks for 'tahg' directory -> if absent, executes obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen in hidden window -> errors suppressed silently.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Base64-encoded PowerShell command, silent error handling, execution in hidden window, and conditional execution based on directory existence.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup for a Python package but includes a suspicious obfuscated PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The command is encoded, run silently, and errors are suppressed, which are common malicious tactics. Multiple reports recognize this pattern, assigning high malware (0.75-0.8), obfuscation (0.8-0.9), and security risk scores (0.75-0.85). Given the consistent evidence of obfuscation, concealment, and execution context, the behavior strongly indicates malicious intent. The broad try-except blocks further mask failures, increasing suspicion. While decoding the command would clarify its purpose, the current evidence justifies a high threat level.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated, silent execution of a PowerShell command, which is a common indicator of malicious activity. The high scores across reports are justified, and the behavior warrants caution. The package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious pending further analysis.",
