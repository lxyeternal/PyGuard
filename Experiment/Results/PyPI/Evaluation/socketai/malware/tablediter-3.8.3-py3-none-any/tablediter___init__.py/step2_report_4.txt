  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports symbols from a local module and exposes them, along with retrieving the package version.\n   - There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code structure is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or similar setup module.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Given the consistent findings, these scores seem reasonable and should remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities that would justify a higher risk score.\n   - The code only manages imports and version retrieval, which are safe operations.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since no malicious activity is detected, the malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any network, file, or external command execution, nor does it include obfuscated or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities or threats are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign module setup for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0               |\n| Security Risk   | 0               |\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and poses no security concerns.",
