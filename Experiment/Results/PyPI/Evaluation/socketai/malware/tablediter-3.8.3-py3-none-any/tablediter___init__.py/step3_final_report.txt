{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing symbols from a local module and exposing them via __all__, while retrieving the package version.",
  "sources": "Imports from .tablediter and importlib.metadata.version(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external data flows are present",
  "flows": "Import statements and version retrieval; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module setup code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package __init__.py, importing symbols from a local module, defining __all__, and retrieving version info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is evident. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package setup code with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
