  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup, importing symbols from a local module and retrieving version info. The code snippet contains no network activity, file I/O beyond import statements, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is standard module boilerplate with no suspicious elements. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty. These scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all evidence points to benign, standard module code with no malicious or risky behavior, higher scores are unwarranted. The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they rely on the code's content, which is safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear, standard, and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a typical module initialization file for a Python package, importing and exposing symbols, and retrieving version info. There are no indications of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nThe scores and analysis are appropriate. No changes are necessary. The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0",
