  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports symbols from a local module (`tablediter`) and sets `__all__` for exports.\n- All reports note the use of `importlib.metadata.version(__name__)` to retrieve the package version.\n- No report mentions any dynamic code execution, network activity, file handling, or data processing beyond imports.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or similar module, serving as an API surface.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- All reports agree that there are no evident sinks for untrusted data, no external data flows, and no operations that could compromise security.\n- The absence of dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling suggests a very low security risk.\n- The consistent identification of benign intent and structure supports the conclusion that this code is safe.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- No issues are found with the logic, reasoning, or scoring.\n- The code is purely structural and metadata-related, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The code is standard package setup code.\n- No suspicious or malicious elements are present.\n- The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain security incident report indicates no actual security issues. The code is benign, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for package initialization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
