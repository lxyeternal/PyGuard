{
  "purpose": "The code primarily imports various functions, classes, and constants from a local module 'tablediter' and exposes them for external use, along with setting the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module 'tablediter' and importlib.metadata for obtaining package version",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports and version info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module setup that imports symbols from a local module and sets __all__ for export. It retrieves version info via importlib.metadata, which is standard. There are no input/output operations, no network communications, and no data processing or manipulation beyond importing and exporting symbols. The code structure and syntax are conventional and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely to expose module contents and set version info, which is typical for Python packages.",
