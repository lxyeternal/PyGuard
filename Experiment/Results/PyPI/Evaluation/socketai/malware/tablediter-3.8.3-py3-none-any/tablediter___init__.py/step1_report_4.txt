{
  "purpose": "This code acts as an interface for importing various functions and constants from the 'tablediter' module and sets module metadata such as version.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imports from a local module (.tablediter) and retrieves package version info via importlib.metadata.version(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily imports static symbols and retrieves metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the version retrieval is a static operation, and imports are static references.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of importlib.metadata for versioning is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various symbols from a local module, presumably for use elsewhere, and sets the module's __all__ for export. It retrieves the package version using importlib.metadata.version(__name__), which is a common practice for versioning metadata. No dynamic code execution, no data handling, no network activity, or other suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, standard module initialization script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It primarily manages imports and metadata.",
