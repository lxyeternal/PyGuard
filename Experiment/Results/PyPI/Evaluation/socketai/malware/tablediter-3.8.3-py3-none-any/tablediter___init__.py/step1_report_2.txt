{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports and re-exports functions and constants related to table data processing and handles version retrieval for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current package's module 'tablediter' and from 'importlib.metadata' to obtain version information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations such as network communication, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "The code imports data from local modules and then exposes those as public API, and retrieves version info without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and constants from a local module 'tablediter', and sets __all__ for module exports. It also uses 'importlib.metadata' to dynamically fetch the package version. All operations are standard Python practices for module setup and version management. No untrusted data sources, no sinks, and no complex control flows that could indicate malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign part of a larger package, handling imports and version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code.",
