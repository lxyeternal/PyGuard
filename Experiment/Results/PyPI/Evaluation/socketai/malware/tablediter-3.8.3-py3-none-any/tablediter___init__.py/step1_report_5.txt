{
  "purpose": "This code primarily imports and exposes functions and constants from a local module 'tablediter' for table data manipulation and also retrieves the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements: '__future__', local module '.tablediter', and 'importlib.metadata' for version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and version retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected. The use of importlib.metadata.version for version info is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific names from a local module and defines __all__ for export. It then fetches the package version using importlib.metadata. There are no dynamic executions, network calls, or credential handling. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python package structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for exposing functions/constants and retrieving package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
