{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package module that imports various functions and constants related to table iteration and formatting, and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from __future__ import annotations', relative import from .tablediter, importlib.metadata for version info.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, no network, file, or sensitive data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module exports and retrieves package version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The import of importlib.metadata.version(__name__) is standard for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations support, then imports specific functions and constants from a local module, and finally sets up the module's __all__ list for exports. It also retrieves the package version using importlib.metadata. All operations are typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar module. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and only deals with module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no malicious or security concerns identified. It simply manages imports and exposes them, along with retrieving package version info.",
