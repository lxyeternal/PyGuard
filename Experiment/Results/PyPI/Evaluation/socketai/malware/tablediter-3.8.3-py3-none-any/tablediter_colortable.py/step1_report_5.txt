{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for styling and rendering colored tables in a terminal or console, primarily focusing on themes and color formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports colorama for terminal color support; takes input from theme parameters and potentially external modules via tablediter (assumed to be a third-party or local module).",
  "sinks": "Uses string concatenation to produce ANSI escape sequences for terminal colors; no external data sink or network communication; no untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Theme parameters (color codes) flow into formatting functions, which produce styled strings for terminal output. No external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior. The code performs standard terminal styling with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The import fallback is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes terminal styling using colorama if available, and defines themes and their application to table rendering. It relies on static theme parameters and standard string formatting. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward styling utility for terminal tables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign styling utility for terminal table rendering. It uses standard practices for ANSI escape sequences and theme management. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
