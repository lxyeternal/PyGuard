  "purpose": "Terminal theming utility for styling table output using ANSI escape sequences and themes.",
  "sources": "Theme parameters, class initializations, and optional colorama import for cross-platform support.",
  "sinks": "Terminal output via get_string method, applying ANSI codes for styling.",
  "flows": "Theme configuration -> ANSI escape sequence generation -> terminal display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing terminal themes with ANSI codes, relying on controlled parameters and optional dependencies. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The use of ANSI escape sequences is standard for styling terminal output, and the code structure is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign theming utility for terminal tables, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and presentational nature.",
