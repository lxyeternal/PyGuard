{
  "purpose": "This code defines theming and color formatting for a table display, using ANSI escape codes for terminal colors.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from external configurations or parameters (e.g., theme settings), but no explicit data input sources are present in the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly formats and outputs ANSI color sequences for terminal display.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily sets and applies theme configurations internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The only notable aspect is the use of ANSI escape sequences, which is standard for terminal color formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for theming and color formatting in terminal output using ANSI codes. It includes optional import of colorama for cross-platform support, but handles ImportError gracefully. No external input handling, network activity, or data exfiltration routines are present. The color codes are hardcoded and used for visual formatting; no dynamic or malicious code execution is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign theming utility for terminal tables, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle or transmit untrusted data, nor does it perform any suspicious operations.",
