{
  "purpose": "Defines themes and color formatting for table display with optional color customization.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, local module tablediter, colorama (conditionally), and class/attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, no network, file, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily within class methods for formatting theme codes and generating string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious input/output handling, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up theme configurations and color formatting for table display. It conditionally imports colorama for terminal color support and gracefully handles ImportError. The Theme class processes ANSI color codes, and the ColorTable class extends tablediter to apply themes. No input validation issues, no external data handling, and no code that executes untrusted data. The logic appears purely presentational and configurable, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign theming and formatting module for tables, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It focuses on presentation logic with optional color support. No security concerns identified.",
