  "conclusion": "The embedded subprocess call in add_row is a malicious backdoor, capable of executing arbitrary code via the 'startingbound' function. This vulnerability compromises the entire codebase, which otherwise appears to be a standard table formatting library. The security risk is severe, and the malware score is set to 1.0, with a security risk score of 1.0, indicating high probability of malicious behavior and potential for exploitation."
