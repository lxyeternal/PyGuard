      "conclusion": "The embedded subprocess call in add_row is a malicious backdoor, capable of executing arbitrary code via the 'startingbound' function. This vulnerability compromises the entire codebase, which otherwise appears to be a standard table formatting library. The security risk is severe, and the malware score is set to 1.0, with a security risk score of 1.0, indicating high probability of malicious behavior and potential for exploitation."

      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, serving as a loader or backdoor that decrypts and executes obfuscated payloads. The obfuscation, dynamic execution, and domain replacement are classic indicators of malicious intent. The overall risk and malware scores should be set at 0.9, reflecting the high probability of malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a suspicious pattern of environment-dependent script execution without validation, which could be exploited maliciously. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the pattern warrants further investigation. Malware score is set at 0.2, reflecting low but notable suspicion; obfuscation score is 0; security risk is moderate at 0.5 due to potential misuse."
