  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload triggered during setup, with characteristics typical of malicious activity such as covert execution and obfuscation. All reports correctly identify these issues, and the assigned high scores are justified. The package should be considered malicious or compromised pending further decoding and analysis of the payload."
