      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package installation. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery, backdoors, or data exfiltration. While the exact payload isn't decoded here, the obfuscation, silent execution, and environment trigger strongly suggest malicious activity. The package should be treated with caution, and further analysis (e.g., decoding the PowerShell command) is recommended before deployment."
