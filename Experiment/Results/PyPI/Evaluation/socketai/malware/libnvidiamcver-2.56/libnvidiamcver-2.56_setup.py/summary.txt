  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-confidence malicious behavior through stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell execution referencing a suspicious URL, fitting common supply chain attack patterns. The package appears legitimate but is likely compromised or intentionally malicious. Scores should reflect high malware (0.9), obfuscation (0.9), and security risk (0.9)."
