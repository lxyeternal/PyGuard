  "purpose": "The code decodes an obfuscated URL, collects sensitive system information including traceback, environment variables, OS info, and external IP, and exfiltrates this data via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL.",
  "sources": "traceback.extract_stack(), os.environ, os.uname(), request.urlopen('https://ipinfo.io/ip')",
  "sinks": "request.urlopen(req, data=data) (sending data to external URL)",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, traceback, IP) → data serialization → HTTP POST request to decoded URL",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URL decoded at runtime, silent exception handling, broad data collection without validation or consent",
  "analysis": "The code performs covert data exfiltration by decoding an obfuscated URL, collecting sensitive system and environment information, and sending it without user consent. The URL obfuscation via base64 is a common evasion technique. Silent exception handling may hide errors, aiding persistence. The data collected can be used for fingerprinting or malicious reconnaissance. No destructive actions are present, but the behavior aligns with spyware or backdoor activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8, obfuscation 0.8, risk ~0.85) are justified given the covert exfiltration of sensitive data, obfuscation, and lack of user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious intent, primarily covert data exfiltration to an obfuscated URL. The behavior is characteristic of spyware or backdoor activity. The assigned scores are appropriate; the malware score should be high (~0.8), obfuscation score also high (~0.8), and overall security risk elevated (~0.85). It warrants high severity review and further investigation.",
