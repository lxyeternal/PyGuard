  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and reasoning.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom frequest import get, post, put, patch, delete\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1: Package Name 'frequest'**\n\n**Presence in code:** Yes, the import statement is present.\n\n**Analysis of the issue:**\n- The package name 'frequest' is suspicious because it closely resembles the legitimate 'requests' library but is misspelled or obfuscated.\n- This pattern is often used in malicious packages to mimic popular libraries, potentially leading to supply chain attacks.\n\n**Logical assessment:**\n- The import itself is benign; it only imports functions.\n- The suspicion arises solely from the package name, not from any code behavior or content (which is not provided).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The package name warrants caution.\n- No malicious activity is confirmed at this point, but further investigation into the package's origin is necessary.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (moderate suspicion based on name similarity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation in the code snippet)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code shown)\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 (some risk due to suspicious package name)\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem reasonable, but perhaps the malware score could be slightly increased if the package name is highly suspicious, as it indicates potential malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2: Absence of Malicious Code or Behavior**\n\n**Presence in code:** No, only import statements.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- No data flows, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials.\n- The code snippet is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears benign in isolation.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 (low, as there's little evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk)\n\n**Assessment:** The scores align with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3: Similarity to 'requests' Library**\n\n**Presence:** Yes, in multiple reports.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The pattern of importing HTTP methods from a similarly named library is suspicious.\n- The misspelling or obfuscation could be an attempt to evade detection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The suspicion is justified, but no active malicious behavior is demonstrated.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 (consistent with suspicion)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.4 (somewhat obfuscated or misspelled)\n- **Malware:** 0.2 (possible, but not confirmed)\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n\n**Assessment:** These scores seem appropriate, given the suspicion but lack of concrete malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4: Overall benign appearance but suspicious package name**\n\n**Presence:** Yes, in multiple reports.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Importing functions alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The main concern is the package name.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign but warrants caution.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence in benignity, but with suspicion)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Final Evaluation**\n\n- The primary concern across all reports is the package name 'frequest', which resembles 'requests' but is potentially malicious or obfuscated.\n- The code snippet itself is minimal and does not demonstrate malicious behavior.\n- The suspicion is based solely on the package name, not on code content.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Reasoning                                                                                  |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**    | 0.2 – Slightly elevated due to suspicious package name, but no evidence of malicious code. |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0.3 – The package name is obfuscated or misspelled, but no code obfuscation present.     |\n| **Risk**       | 0.4 – Moderate risk due to potential supply chain attack vector, but no active threat.   |\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The package name 'frequest' should be verified against official repositories.\n- Additional code or context is needed to confirm malicious activity.\n- The scores in the reports are reasonable, but perhaps the malware score could be slightly increased to reflect the suspicious package name.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**\nThe code snippet is benign in isolation but involves a package with a suspicious name that could be part of a supply chain attack. The scores reflect this suspicion appropriately, but vigilance is advised before deploying or trusting this dependency.",
