{
  "purpose": "Import functions for HTTP methods from a module named 'frequest'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks occur here; the code only imports functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not process data or perform network operations.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'frequest' is suspicious due to its similarity to 'requests', potentially indicating obfuscation or malicious intent, but no malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no active behavior. The primary concern is the package name 'frequest', which resembles a common library but is misspelled or obfuscated. This pattern can be used in supply chain attacks or malicious packages. However, in the absence of further code, behavior, or package analysis, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports reflect suspicion based on naming but do not indicate active malicious code. The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious payloads or behaviors are observed. The obfuscated score can be moderate (~0.3) due to the suspicious package name, but no obfuscation techniques are evident in the code snippet. The security risk score should be low (~0.2), acknowledging the potential supply chain concern but lacking concrete evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation; the main concern is the suspicious package name 'frequest'. No malicious behavior is demonstrated, but the package's origin warrants further investigation. The scores should reflect low malware risk, moderate suspicion due to naming, and minimal active threat.",
