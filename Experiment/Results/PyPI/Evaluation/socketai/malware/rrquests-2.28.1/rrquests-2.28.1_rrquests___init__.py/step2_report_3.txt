  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and conclusions.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code snippet is:\n```python\nfrom frequest import get, post, put, patch, delete\n```\n- All reports correctly identify this import statement.\n\n**Step 2: Are there any actual errors, flaws, or mistakes?**\n\n- The code itself is syntactically correct.\n- No evidence of malicious code, data flow, or active network operations is present.\n- The only concern is the package name 'frequest', which is suspiciously similar to 'requests'.\n\n**Step 3: Review the reasoning and conclusions**\n\n- The reports generally note the suspicious naming of 'frequest' and recommend caution.\n- They correctly state that the snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious activity but that the package name warrants further investigation.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the scores**\n\n- **Confidence:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.9 across reports. Higher confidence should be reserved for stronger evidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** Mostly 0 or 0.4, indicating little to no obfuscation, except one report with 0.4.\n- **Malware:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.2.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher, but still low, as only the package name is suspicious.\n\n**Step 5: Justify higher risk or malware scores**\n\n- Since no actual malicious code or behavior is present, scores should remain low.\n- The suspicion stems solely from the package name, which is not enough to assign a high malware or risk score without further evidence.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any assumptions**\n\n- The assumption that 'frequest' is malicious is reasonable but unconfirmed. It could be a typo or a legitimate custom package.\n- The reports do not mention checking the package repository or code; such investigation would be necessary for certainty.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are generally consistent with the analysis—low malware, low to moderate suspicion, and low security risk.\n- The obfuscated score is mostly low, which aligns with the absence of obfuscation in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment and Recommendations**\n\n**Overall, the code is benign but the package name 'frequest' is suspicious.**  \n**The risk and malware scores should remain low unless further investigation reveals malicious activity.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n  *No evidence of malicious code or behavior in the snippet or reports.*\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.1  \n  *Slight suspicion due to the package name, but no obfuscation techniques observed.*\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2  \n  *Caution warranted due to the suspicious package name, but no active threat demonstrated.*\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0             |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.1             |\n| Risk               | 0.2             |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code itself is safe, but the package name 'frequest' should be verified before use. No evidence of malware or obfuscation justifies higher scores at this point.",
