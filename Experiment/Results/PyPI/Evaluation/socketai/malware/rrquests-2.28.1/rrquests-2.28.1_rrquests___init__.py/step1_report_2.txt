  "purpose": "Import HTTP request methods from the 'frequest' library, likely for making web requests.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing functions from 'frequest' module.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions to send or receive data over the network.",
  "flows": "Imported functions could be used to send untrusted data to external servers or receive data, depending on subsequent code.",
  "anomalies": "No code beyond imports; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions (get, post, put, patch, delete) from a module named 'frequest'. There are no other operations, data handling, or network activity shown. Without additional context or usage, this snippet does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The module name 'frequest' is unusual but not inherently suspicious; it may be a typo or custom library. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The snippet appears benign, though it is incomplete and does not demonstrate actual request operations.",
