  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is the suspicious package name 'rrquests', which may be an attempt at typosquatting or impersonation. No malicious activity is present, and the overall security risk is low. The package should be reviewed for intent, but based solely on this code, it is safe."
