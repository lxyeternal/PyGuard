  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution, reading README.md for long description, defining metadata, dependencies, and calling setup().",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters within setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and defines package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'rrquests' is a misspelling of 'requests', which could be an attempt at typosquatting or impersonation. The 'package_dir' mapping references 'requests', which may be inconsistent or misleading.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The primary anomaly is the package name 'rrquests', which resembles 'requests' and could be used for impersonation. No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The package_dir mapping referencing 'requests' alongside the package name 'rrquests' suggests potential typosquatting or misdirection, but no actual malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, indicating low malware and obfuscation scores, with a slight increase in risk due to the suspicious name.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is the suspicious package name 'rrquests', which may be an attempt at typosquatting or impersonation. No malicious activity is present, and the overall security risk is low. The package should be reviewed for intent, but based solely on this code, it is safe.",
