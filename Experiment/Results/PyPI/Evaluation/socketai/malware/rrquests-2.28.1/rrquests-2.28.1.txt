The main concern is the suspicious package name 'rrquests', which may be an attempt at typosquatting or impersonation. No malicious activity is present, and the overall security risk is low. The package should be reviewed for intent, but based solely on this code, it is safe."

No malicious behavior is demonstrated, but the package's origin warrants further investigation. The scores should reflect low malware risk, moderate suspicion due to naming, and minimal active threat."
