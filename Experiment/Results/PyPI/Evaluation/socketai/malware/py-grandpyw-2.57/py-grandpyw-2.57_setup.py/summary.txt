  "conclusion": "The code contains highly obfuscated, suspicious PowerShell payloads executed during package setup, with external domain references and silent execution. These indicators strongly suggest malicious activity, making this package dangerous. The high obfuscation, external communication, and hidden execution justify high malware (0.85), obfuscated (0.9), and security risk (0.9) scores. It should be flagged as malicious or compromised, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended for confirmation."
