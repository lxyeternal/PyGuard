      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during package setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and error suppression are typical tactics used in malicious supply chain components. While the actual payload is not decoded, the pattern warrants treating this package as malicious or highly suspicious until further analysis of the encoded command is performed."
