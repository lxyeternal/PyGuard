{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle data processing or network communication, but lacks detailed context or implementation details.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs from environment variables, function parameters, or external sources.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file I/O, environment variables, or other output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) without explicit intermediate processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code is minimal or absent.",
  "analysis": "The code, or lack thereof, shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low confidence scores reflect limited context, but the absence of malicious indicators suggests benign intent. The security risk is moderate (around 0.3) in some reports due to potential insecure data handling, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident. The code's minimal or missing nature reduces the likelihood of supply chain sabotage or malware presence.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assessments and scores are consistent with the limited information, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
