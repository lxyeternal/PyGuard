  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading, input/output operations, environment variables, network calls, data flows, and obfuscation indicators.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, and data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables leading to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, complex variable names, lack of concrete malicious activity, or absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Reports indicate that Report 1 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, suggesting suspicion but no definitive malicious activity. The malware score is adjusted to 0.3 to reflect uncertainty, with obfuscation at 0.7 and moderate security risk at 0.5. Report 2 and others lack code or show benign behavior, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low security risk. The scores are consistent with the descriptions; no concrete malicious indicators are present. Adjustments are made to better align scores with evidence, emphasizing cautious assessment for suspicious but unconfirmed code.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 exhibits obfuscation and dynamic features, indicating moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are adjusted to reflect this, with low confidence in malicious intent. Other reports are benign or lack data, with appropriate zero scores. Continuous monitoring and further analysis are recommended for Report 1 if code becomes available.",
