  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, it is not clear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from external modules or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands or network connections if used, but none are explicitly shown in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables through processing functions, but no direct malicious flow is apparent from the code provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward without hidden or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or unsafe code practices are evident. The structure is typical for utility scripts, and the absence of obfuscation or malicious code segments suggests low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for general use.",
