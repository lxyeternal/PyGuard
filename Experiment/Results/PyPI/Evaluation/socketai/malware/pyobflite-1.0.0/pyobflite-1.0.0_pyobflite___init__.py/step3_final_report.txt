  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and performs utility functions without untrusted input or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "No network, file, or system command executions are present that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks; the code operates on internal variables only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior. It reads environment variables and performs utility functions, which are common benign operations. The absence of network or system calls further reduces concern. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The scores reflect a low threat level, consistent with the analysis.",
