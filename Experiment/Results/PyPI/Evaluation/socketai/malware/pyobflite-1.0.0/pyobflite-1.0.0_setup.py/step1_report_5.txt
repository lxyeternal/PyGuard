{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and then execute a function that downloads and runs an external script from a GitHub URL, possibly to gather system information or perform malicious actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from a URL ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoelDev27/93kjasg89/main/WindowsDefender.py') via requests.get. It also executes commands using subprocess.run, which can run arbitrary scripts.",
  "targets": "Execution of the downloaded script via subprocess.run(['python', ruta]) can potentially execute malicious code. The script's content is unknown, but the process indicates execution of remote code.",
  "flows": "The code fetches external script content ('requests.get') and writes it to a file, then executes it ('subprocess.run') before deleting the file. Data flows from remote server to local disk and then to execution environment.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated pip install commands for numerous libraries, some of which are unrelated or suspicious (e.g., 'winregistry', 'robloxpy'). Downloading and executing a remote script without verification is suspicious. Use of subprocess to run external scripts dynamically indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by installing multiple Python packages, which is unusual and could be used to prepare the environment for malicious activities. It then defines a function 'send_discord_info' that downloads a script from a remote URL and executes it, then deletes the local copy. The URL points to a Python script on GitHub, which could contain malicious code. The process of fetching and executing remote code without verification is a significant security concern. The package setup appears legitimate but could be a cover for malicious activity, especially since the core function downloads and runs external code dynamically.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code without validation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as system info theft, backdoors, or remote control. The repeated environment setup and dynamic code execution are suspicious. Overall, the code poses a high security risk.",
