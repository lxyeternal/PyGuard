{
  "purpose": "The code installs multiple Python packages, downloads a remote script from GitHub, executes it without validation, and then deletes it. Its primary purpose appears to be to execute external code potentially for malicious activities.",
  "sources": "Requests module fetching remote script; subprocess running the downloaded script; os module handling file operations.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run(['python', ruta]) executing the downloaded script; file write operations for saving remote content.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote code -> writes to local file -> subprocess.run() executes the local file -> os.remove() deletes the file.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated installation of numerous packages without clear purpose; downloading and executing remote code without validation; no checksum or signature verification; execution of code from an untrusted source.",
  "analysis": "The script installs various packages, some suspicious, possibly to prepare environment or obfuscate intent. It then downloads a script from a GitHub URL, saves it locally, executes it via subprocess, and deletes the local copy. The remote code execution pattern is a classic indicator of malicious activity. No validation or verification of the remote script is performed, increasing risk. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The pattern suggests potential backdoors, data exfiltration, or other malicious payloads, though the actual content of the remote script is unknown. The repeated package installations and remote fetch further support malicious intent. Overall, the behavior aligns with high-severity malware activity, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to its pattern of downloading and executing unverified remote code, which is characteristic of malware delivery mechanisms. The scores should reflect this high threat level, with malware and risk scores at 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, but its behavior is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
