{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package and then downloads and executes a remote script from GitHub, likely for information gathering or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote URL ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoelDev27/93kjasg89/main/WindowsDefender.py') via requests.get and from various installed modules. It also reads and writes to the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script using subprocess.run(['python', ruta]) which could execute malicious code. Removal of the script file after execution reduces traceability but still executes potentially harmful code.",
  "flows": "Code fetches remote script (source) and writes it to a local file, then executes it (sink). Data from the remote script flows into system execution without validation.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated pip installation commands, which may be used to ensure modules are available or to hide malicious dependencies. Downloading and executing remote code directly is suspicious. The script is fetched from a non-standard URL. The script uses subprocess to run external commands, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with multiple pip install commands, some redundant, possibly to ensure dependencies. It defines a function 'send_discord_info' that downloads a Python script from a remote URL and executes it. The script is then deleted locally. The remote script URL is suspicious, and executing remote code without validation is a security risk. The code appears designed to run potentially malicious code retrieved from the internet, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks or remote payload execution. No obfuscation is detected, but the behavior of executing remote code poses significant security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious or at least highly suspicious due to its behavior of downloading and executing remote code without validation. This pattern indicates potential malicious intent, such as remote command execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
