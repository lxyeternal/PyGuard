{
  "purpose": "This code appears to install a variety of Python libraries, download a script from a remote URL, execute it, then delete it. It also sets up a package configuration. The core malicious activity is likely to be in the downloaded script executed via subprocess.",
  "sources": "Requests to fetch external script, subprocess to execute downloaded script, file writing to save the script locally",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run(['python', ruta]) - executes the downloaded script; os.remove(ruta) - deletes the script after execution",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote code -> writes to local file -> subprocess.run executes the remote code -> deletes local file",
  "anomalies": "Repeated pip install commands that include potentially suspicious packages (e.g., 'robloxpy', 'pyautogui', 'winreg') and dynamic code download and execution without validation. The remote URL points to a GitHub raw content, which could host malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by installing numerous packages, some of which are common, but others like 'robloxpy' and 'pyautogui' can be used maliciously. It then defines a function to fetch a remote script from a GitHub URL, save it locally, and execute it immediately. After execution, it deletes the local file. The main execution calls this function, meaning the remote script runs in the context of this program. This pattern is typical of malicious activity involving remote code execution, especially given the lack of validation, encryption, or checksums for the remote script. The overall structure suggests an intent to quietly download and execute arbitrary code, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code installs multiple packages, then downloads and executes a remote script without validation, and finally deletes it. This pattern indicates malicious intent, likely for executing malicious code or backdoors at runtime. The overall risk is high, with potential for executing malicious payloads from the remote URL.",
