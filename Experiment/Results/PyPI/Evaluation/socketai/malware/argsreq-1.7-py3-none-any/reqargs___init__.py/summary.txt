  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a clear malicious pattern of downloading and executing remote code from an untrusted source, with obfuscation tactics used to hide intent. The benign functions are unrelated and likely distractors. The high scores across reports are appropriate; the core activity warrants classifying this package as highly malicious with a very high security risk."
