{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote executable from a hardcoded URL and executes it, indicating malicious intent. It also contains benign functions generating and plotting random mathematical functions, likely as obfuscation or distraction.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a hardcoded URL string, writes the downloaded content to a temporary file, and executes it via subprocess.call.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.call function executes the downloaded file, which could run arbitrary malicious code on the system.",
  "flows": "Source (hardcoded URL) -> download via requests.get -> write to temp file -> subprocess.call to execute.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode obfuscated variable names, embedded malicious download and execution code, and unrelated benign plotting functions included in the same script.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a segment that downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link and runs it, which is a clear indicator of malicious activity. The rest of the code, involving functions for generating and plotting random mathematical functions, appears benign and likely serves as obfuscation or distraction. Variable names with Unicode characters suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The malicious segment is executed in the main() function, with no validation of the downloaded content. The code's behavior aligns with typical supply chain attacks involving remote code execution. The obfuscation and embedded malicious code justify high malware and security risk scores. The benign functions do not mitigate the malicious activity. Overall, the code demonstrates a high probability of malicious intent with active remote code execution capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clearly identifiable malicious segment that downloads and executes remote code, with obfuscation tactics employed. The scores should reflect maximum severity, with malware and risk scores set to 1. The obfuscation score is justified at around 0.8 due to Unicode variable names. This package poses a critical security threat and should be flagged for immediate removal or further investigation.",
