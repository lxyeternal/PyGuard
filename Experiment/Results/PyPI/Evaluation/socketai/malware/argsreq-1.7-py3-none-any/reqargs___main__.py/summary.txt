  "conclusion": "The code is benign and follows a common pattern for script entry points. The security risk is minimal unless the imported module is malicious, which cannot be determined here. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a conservative security risk score of 0.1 is recommended to reflect the minimal inherent risk."
