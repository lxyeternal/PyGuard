{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a payload from a Discord CDN URL, writes it to a temporary file, and executes it without validation, indicating malicious activity. It also contains benign-looking plotting functions and filesystem utilities likely as distractions.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to Discord CDN URL, reading from temp file, and the code download process itself.",
  "sinks": "Writing downloaded content to a file, executing the file via subprocess.call.",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> save to temp file -> execute file without validation.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord URL, Unicode obfuscated variable names, immediate execution of remote payload, presence of unrelated benign functions.",
  "analysis": "The core malicious pattern is the download and execution of external code from a Discord CDN URL, with no validation or sandboxing. Obfuscation via Unicode variable names and code distraction functions are present but do not negate the malicious intent. The benign functions for plotting are likely distractors. The download-and-execute pattern is consistent and explicit, indicating high malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious activity, primarily the remote code fetch and execution. The presence of obfuscation and unrelated functions does not mitigate the core threat. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the package should be considered malicious.",
