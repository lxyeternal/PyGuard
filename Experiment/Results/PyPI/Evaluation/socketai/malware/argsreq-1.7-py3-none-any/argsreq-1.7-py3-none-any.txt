The scores should reflect maximum severity, with malware and risk scores set to 1. The obfuscation score is justified at around 0.8 due to Unicode variable names. This package poses a critical security threat and should be flagged for immediate removal or further investigation."

The benign functions are unrelated and likely distractors. The high scores across reports are appropriate; the core activity warrants classifying this package as highly malicious with a very high security risk."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a conservative security risk score of 0.1 is recommended to reflect the minimal inherent risk."
