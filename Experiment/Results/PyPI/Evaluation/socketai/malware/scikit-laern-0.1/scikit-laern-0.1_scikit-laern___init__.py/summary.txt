  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious features but lacks definitive payload evidence. Slightly lowering malware and obfuscation scores for Report 2 would improve accuracy. No immediate threats are identified, and the overall assessment remains conservative and justified."
