  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, hardcoded strings, dynamic imports, eval/exec functions, standard modules, and code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file operations, or code execution points that could be exploited or indicate malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or hardcoded strings flow into functions like eval/exec or network calls, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, dynamic import statements, hardcoded credentials or URLs, obfuscation indicators, or unexplained code structures.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally align in their assessments. Reports 1, 3, 4, and 5 describe benign code with high confidence and appropriate low malware and risk scores. Report 2 indicates signs of obfuscation and potential malicious constructs, such as eval/exec and hardcoded strings, leading to higher scores. However, without concrete evidence of malicious payloads, the malware score of 0.4 and obfuscation score of 0.6 may be slightly overstated; conservative adjustment to 0.2-0.3 for malware and 0.3 for obfuscation is advisable. The risk score in Report 2 (0.6) reflects suspicion but should be moderated unless confirmed. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, but minor reductions in suspicion levels for Report 2 are recommended to align with the lack of confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. Report 2 shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious features but lacks definitive payload evidence. Slightly lowering malware and obfuscation scores for Report 2 would improve accuracy. No immediate threats are identified, and the overall assessment remains conservative and justified.",
