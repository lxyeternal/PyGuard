  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension of the invoke framework for remote task execution, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The security risk score could be slightly increased to around 0.4 to reflect the potential misuse of user inputs in a supply chain context, but overall, the code is safe if proper input validation is enforced during deployment."
