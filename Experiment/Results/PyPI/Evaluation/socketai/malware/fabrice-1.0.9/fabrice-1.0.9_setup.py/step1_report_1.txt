{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup for a Python package, determining package names and dependencies based on environment variables and directory structure, and prepares the package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), the local filesystem (directory checks and README file), and the _version.py file inside the package.",
  "sinks": "Reading the _version.py file (exec), setup() function call which writes package metadata, and reading the README file for long_description.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package naming; directory presence checks also influence naming; reading _version.py executes code to get version; reading README affects long_description; setup() writes package metadata including dependencies and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to evaluate the contents of _version.py, which could be risky if _version.py is tampered with, but this is common in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-based configuration for packaging, reading version info via exec(), and reading a README file to build the long description. All other operations are standard for Python setup scripts. The use of exec() on a local file is typical in setup processes, not inherently malicious, but could be a vector if _version.py is compromised. No network activity, data leakage, or suspicious code logic detected. No obfuscated code or malware-like behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The use of exec() is common but should be kept in a secure environment. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
