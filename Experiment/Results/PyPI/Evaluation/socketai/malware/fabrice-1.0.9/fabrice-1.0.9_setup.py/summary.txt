  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a common pattern of loading version info via exec(). No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary security concern is the potential risk if '_version.py' is compromised, but in a trusted environment, this is manageable. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
