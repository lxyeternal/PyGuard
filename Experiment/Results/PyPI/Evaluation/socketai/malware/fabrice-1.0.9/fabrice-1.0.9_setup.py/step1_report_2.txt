{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package for distribution, including package discovery, version reading, and entry point setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2' directories, version file '_version.py', README file.",
  "sinks": "exec() call to execute version file content, open() calls to read files, setuptool's setup() function which may install dependencies and create executable scripts.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package and binary names; reading '_version.py' feeds into version variable; long_description sourced from README; setup() processes all collected info to build package.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute '_version.py' content instead of import, which could be risky if the file content is malicious or altered. No other suspicious or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package configuration tasks, with environment-based logic to select package names. The exec() call to load version info is a potential security concern if the '_version.py' file is tampered with, as it executes arbitrary code. All other file reads and operations are standard for package setup. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration with a notable use of exec() for version loading, which could pose a security risk if the '_version.py' file is compromised. No malware or malicious intent observed, but exec() usage warrants caution.",
