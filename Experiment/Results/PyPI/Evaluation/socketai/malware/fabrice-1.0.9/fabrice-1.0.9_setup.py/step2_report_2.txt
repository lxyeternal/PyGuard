  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package.\n- The main point of concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `_version.py`.\n- No reports detect malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The risk scores assigned are generally low (around 0.2-0.3), which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes, the use of `exec()` on `_version.py` is present and correctly identified as a potential security concern.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No, the reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes, the malware scores are 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Security risk scores are around 0.2-0.3, which is reasonable given the use of `exec()`.\n\n- **Is the justification for risk scores > 0.5 valid?**  \n  No, none of the reports assign scores above 0.5, which aligns with the absence of actual malicious behavior.\n\n- **Is the malware score justified?**  \n  Yes, all reports assign malware=0, which is justified as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Are assumptions about vulnerabilities justified?**  \n  The concern about `exec()` is valid but based on standard best practices, it is a known pattern in setup scripts, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The main security concern is the use of `exec()` to evaluate `_version.py`. While common, it could be exploited if `_version.py` is tampered with.  \n- No other suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2-0.3 (due to `exec()` usage)  \n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, standard setup script with a known caveat)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' findings and reasoning. The code is typical for a Python package setup, with the only caveat being the `exec()` pattern, which is common but should be used cautiously.",
