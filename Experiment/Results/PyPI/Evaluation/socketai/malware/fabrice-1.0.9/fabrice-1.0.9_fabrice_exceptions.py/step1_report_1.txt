  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a larger Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurring; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of standard exception class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These are straightforward class definitions inheriting from Exception with no suspicious logic or code execution. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The comments suggest a possible future refactoring or code movement, but no actual malicious intent is indicated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for error handling in Python projects and does not contain any malicious code or security vulnerabilities.",
