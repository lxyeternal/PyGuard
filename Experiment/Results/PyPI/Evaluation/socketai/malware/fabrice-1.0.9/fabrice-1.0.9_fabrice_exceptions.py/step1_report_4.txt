{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a larger application, likely related to task management or environment handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares classes and does not execute any logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These are typical in Python projects for handling specific error conditions. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The classes do not perform any actions beyond inheritance. The comments suggest intended future refactoring but do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security concerns.",
