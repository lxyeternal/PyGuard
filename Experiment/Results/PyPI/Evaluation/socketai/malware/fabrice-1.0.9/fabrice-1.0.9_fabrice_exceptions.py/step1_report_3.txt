{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or include input/output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. Each class inherits from Exception and provides minimal constructors or docstrings. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, network operations, or data leaks. The comments suggest intentions for code organization and potential refactoring but do not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Python class definitions for exceptions, with no malicious behavior or security risks present. It appears to be purely structural, serving as part of larger application logic.",
