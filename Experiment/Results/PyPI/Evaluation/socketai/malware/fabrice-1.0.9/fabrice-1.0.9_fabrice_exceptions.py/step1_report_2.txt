  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to task execution, group results, and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception classes are defined statically in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow to untrusted sources or sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; classes are simply definitions without logic that processes untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These are standard exception definitions with no input handling or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The classes serve as markers for specific error conditions, and no external or untrusted data is processed or transmitted. Overall, the code is purely structural, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, safe set of exception class definitions for managing errors in a larger application context. There are no security concerns or malicious behaviors identified.",
