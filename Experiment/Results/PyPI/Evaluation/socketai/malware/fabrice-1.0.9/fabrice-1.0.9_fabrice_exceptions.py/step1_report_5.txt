{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to group results, environment variables, and task management.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with straightforward constructors and docstrings. There are no data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The classes are intended for error handling and do not contain logic that could be exploited. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase handling exceptions.",
