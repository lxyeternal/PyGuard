  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Python application, including general 'nothing to do', group errors, and environment import issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class declarations with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three exception classes inheriting from Exception, with one including an __init__ method to store a result object. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious intent. All signals indicate benign, standard exception class definitions. No security vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not introduce risks. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm the absence of obfuscation or malicious code. The assigned scores in all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of standard exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
