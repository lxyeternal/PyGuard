  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`.\n- No data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Comments indicate potential future refactoring but do not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The logic is straightforward and correct for defining exception classes.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`.  \n  **Justification:** The code does not perform any malicious actions, payloads, or obfuscated code. It’s purely structural.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign `obfuscated: 0`.  \n  **Justification:** The code is clear, straightforward, and contains no obfuscation.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`.  \n  **Justification:** No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0**  \n  - Obfuscated: **0**  \n  - Risk: **0**  \n\n- **Additional comments:**  \n  The code is standard exception class definitions with no security concerns. The comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
