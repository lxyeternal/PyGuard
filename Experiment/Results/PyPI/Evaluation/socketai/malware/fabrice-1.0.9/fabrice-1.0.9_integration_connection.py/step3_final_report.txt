  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for Fabric SSH connections, verifying connection management, command execution (with and without PTY), sudo commands, and timeouts in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('TRAVIS', 'LOGNAME'), local files ('/usr/share/dict/words'), command inputs.",
  "sinks": "Command execution results, environment variables, local file contents.",
  "flows": "Sources (env vars, files) feed into command execution; command outputs are captured and verified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded sudo password ('mypass') for testing; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for SSH and command execution, with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Environment variables and local files are used in a benign manner. The hardcoded sudo password is a minor concern but acceptable in a controlled testing context. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight elevation in security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the hardcoded credentials but remains low given the testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or supply chain risks. The scores are consistent and appropriate. The only minor concern is the hardcoded sudo password, which is acceptable for testing but should be avoided outside controlled environments.",
