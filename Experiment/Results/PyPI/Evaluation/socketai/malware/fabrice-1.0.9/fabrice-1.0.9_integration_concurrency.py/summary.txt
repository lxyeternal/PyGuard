  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign testing suite aimed at verifying SSH connection independence and threading behavior on localhost. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose."
