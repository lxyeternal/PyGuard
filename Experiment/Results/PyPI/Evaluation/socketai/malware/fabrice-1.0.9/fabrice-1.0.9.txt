      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation but contains significant security vulnerabilities due to hardcoded secrets and insecure environment handling. These issues should be addressed to improve security posture. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, but the overall security risk is moderate (~0.6)."

The primary security concern is the potential risk if '_version.py' is compromised, but in a trusted environment, this is manageable. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal security risk (around 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks beyond minor development placeholders. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minor incomplete features but no security concerns."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate extension of the invoke framework for remote task execution, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The security risk score could be slightly increased to around 0.4 to reflect the potential misuse of user inputs in a supply chain context, but overall, the code is safe if proper input validation is enforced during deployment."
