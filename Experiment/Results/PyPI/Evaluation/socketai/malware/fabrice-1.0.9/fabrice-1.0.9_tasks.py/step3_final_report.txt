  "purpose": "Automation tasks for release, testing, documentation, and packaging workflows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded secrets, input parameters, configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables, sys.path modifications, shell commands, network configurations, runtime environment objects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence connection and build configurations; hardcoded secrets are used directly in code; sys.path modifications affect module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'mypass'), environment variable manipulations, sys.path modifications, TODO comments indicating insecure or incomplete patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs automation for build, release, and testing processes. It contains hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations that pose security risks but no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or active malicious behaviors. The code is straightforward without obfuscation. The presence of secrets and environment handling increases the security risk score, but there are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation but contains significant security vulnerabilities due to hardcoded secrets and insecure environment handling. These issues should be addressed to improve security posture. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, but the overall security risk is moderate (~0.6).",
