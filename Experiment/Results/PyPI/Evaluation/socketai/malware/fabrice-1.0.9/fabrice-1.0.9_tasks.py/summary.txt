  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation but contains significant security vulnerabilities due to hardcoded secrets and insecure environment handling. These issues should be addressed to improve security posture. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, but the overall security risk is moderate (~0.6)."
