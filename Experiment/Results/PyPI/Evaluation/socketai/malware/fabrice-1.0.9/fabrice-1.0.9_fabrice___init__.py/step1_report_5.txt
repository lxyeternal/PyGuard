  "purpose": "Importing modules and classes for a Python package related to connection management, task execution, grouping, and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; no network or system commands are executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; imports are static and do not involve runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or suspicious code patterns. The import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, establishing a structure for a package. No input handling, data processing, or network activity is present. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a typical module initialization or package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import block with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply organizes and exposes various components of a Python package.",
