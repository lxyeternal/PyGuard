{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing internal components such as version info, connection handlers, task runners, grouping mechanisms, task definitions, and execution frameworks for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports static modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, typical of a package's __init__.py or setup file. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly interpret this as benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is effectively 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm its benign nature, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the benign assessment. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
