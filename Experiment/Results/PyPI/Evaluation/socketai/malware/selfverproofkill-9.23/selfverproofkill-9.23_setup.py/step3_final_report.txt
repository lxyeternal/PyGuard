{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'selfverproofkill' with package 'modlib' and includes a conditional malicious payload execution via obfuscated PowerShell command during installation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg'; execution of subprocess with encoded PowerShell command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executing obfuscated PowerShell command with '-EncodedCommand'",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> conditional execution -> subprocess call with encoded payload",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated, base64-encoded PowerShell command; silent error suppression; execution during package setup; presence of suspicious URL comment",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg', and if absent, executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command encoded with '-EncodedCommand'. This command is run silently with no window, indicating stealth. The obfuscation and the URL in comments suggest malicious intent, likely for remote code execution or backdoor installation. The setup() call appears legitimate but is overshadowed by this malicious payload. Error suppression hides failures, increasing risk. The overall behavior aligns with common supply chain attack tactics involving malicious package payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-probability malicious payload executed conditionally during package installation, using obfuscation and stealth techniques. The suspicious URL and silent execution further support malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified. This package should be considered compromised or malicious until the encoded PowerShell command is decoded and verified. Users should avoid installing or deploying this package in production environments.",
