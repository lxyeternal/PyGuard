      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-probability malicious payload executed conditionally during package installation, using obfuscation and stealth techniques. The suspicious URL and silent execution further support malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified. This package should be considered compromised or malicious until the encoded PowerShell command is decoded and verified. Users should avoid installing or deploying this package in production environments."
