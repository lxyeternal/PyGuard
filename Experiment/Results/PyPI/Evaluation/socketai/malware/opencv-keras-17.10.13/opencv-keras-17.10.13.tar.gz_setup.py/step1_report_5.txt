{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'opencv_keras' and includes an embedded base64-encoded script that is executed at runtime.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from variables and executes the decoded base64-encoded string, which is at the end of the script.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decoded code, which could potentially run malicious code if the base64 string is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading package info, checking for a specific file, decoding base64 content, and executing it via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically decoded code is suspicious; the base64 content is obfuscated and could conceal malicious behavior. The code inside the base64 decodes to an HTTP request to a remote server and then calls a function named 'subprocess.call' with a suspicious-looking list, which may execute system commands.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging modules and third-party requests. It then checks for the existence of a specific file 'hifromDreamyOak' and exits if present. The embedded base64 string, when decoded, runs code that performs an HTTP GET request to a remote URL, likely for data collection or command-and-control purposes, and attempts to call subprocess.call with decoded parameters, which could execute arbitrary commands. The obfuscation via base64 and use of exec() suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious activity. The package metadata appears benign, but the embedded code is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload that executes remote HTTP requests and potentially malicious subprocess commands. The use of exec() on decoded code indicates malicious or suspicious behavior, likely aimed at unauthorized remote control or data exfiltration. This package should be considered unsafe due to the embedded obfuscated code and the suspicious remote activity.",
