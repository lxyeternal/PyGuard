  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package with additional embedded code execution.",
  "sources": "File existence check ('hifromDreamyOak'), embedded base64-encoded code, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing decoded base64 code, os.path.exists check, network requests within embedded code.",
  "flows": "File check triggers script exit; base64 code decoded and executed, which fetches external resources and executes them.",
  "anomalies": "Embedded base64-encoded code that, when decoded, performs network requests to external servers and executes code dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup routine with minimal dependencies and metadata. It contains a hidden embedded base64 string that, when decoded, executes code involving network requests to an external domain (cdn.discordapp.com). The code appears to fetch and potentially execute remote content, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The file check for 'hifromDreamyOak' seems benign, but the embedded code's purpose is malicious due to dynamic remote code execution. This indicates intentional concealment of malicious behavior within the embedded code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded obfuscated code that fetches and executes remote content, indicating malicious intent. The setup code itself appears benign, but the embedded payload is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
