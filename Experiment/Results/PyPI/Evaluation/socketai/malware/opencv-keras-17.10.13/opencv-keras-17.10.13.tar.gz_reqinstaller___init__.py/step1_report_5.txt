  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get() to fetch data from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executing the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote content -> writes to temporary file -> subprocess.call() executes the temporary file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link and runs it without validation or user consent. No validation, checksum, or signature verification of the downloaded file.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches an executable file from a remote server (Discord CDN), saves it temporarily, and executes it directly. This pattern is typical of malicious activity, especially since the source is external and untrusted. The code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the file, nor does it restrict or inform the user. Running arbitrary executables fetched from the internet poses a high security risk, as it can execute malicious payloads, malware, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It downloads and executes an external executable without validation, representing a significant security threat. This pattern is commonly used in malware delivery and remote code execution attacks.",
