  "purpose": "Download an executable file from a remote URL and run it locally.",
  "sources": "Requests module fetching data from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call executing the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves data from URL -> writing to temp file -> subprocess.call executes temp file.",
  "anomalies": "Downloading and executing a remote executable without verification; no checksum or signature validation; direct execution of external code is risky.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote Discord CDN URL, writes it to a temporary file, and immediately executes it. No validation, signature checks, or user prompts are present. This pattern is highly suspicious because it can facilitate remote code execution, malware installation, or malicious payload deployment. The use of subprocess.call with a downloaded executable from an untrusted source is a significant security concern, especially without any validation or sandboxing. The code does not perform any input validation, error handling, or security checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, as it downloads and executes a remote executable without validation, which is characteristic of malware or malicious payload delivery. It poses a significant security risk and should be avoided or further analyzed in a controlled environment.",
