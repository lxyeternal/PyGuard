      "conclusion": "The embedded payload is highly suspicious, involving obfuscation, remote code execution, and network activity. The code's behavior aligns with malicious intent, warranting a high malware score (~0.85) and security risk (~0.9). The setup code itself appears benign, but the payload's actions pose significant security concerns. The package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious pending further analysis."
