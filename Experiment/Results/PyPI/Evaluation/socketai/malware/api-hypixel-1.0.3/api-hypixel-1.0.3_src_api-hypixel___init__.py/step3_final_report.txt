{
  "purpose": "Stealthily collects specific user configuration files from known directories and exfiltrates their contents to a remote server by dynamically fetching the server URL via base64 decoding and HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "Reading files from user directories: ~/.lunarclient/settings/game/accounts.json, AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/essential/microsoft_accounts.json, AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/launcher_accounts.json",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the URL obtained from the remote server, transmitting file contents as form data",
  "flows": "Decodes base64 URL -> Performs GET request to retrieve webhook URL -> Reads configuration files -> Sends their contents via POST to the retrieved URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the URL; targeting of sensitive user files without consent; silent exfiltration without validation or encryption",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string to obtain a URL, then performs a GET request to that URL to retrieve a webhook or server address. It searches for specific user configuration files in common directories. If any files are found, it reads their contents and sends them via a POST request to the fetched URL. No obfuscation beyond base64 decoding is present. The activity involves reading sensitive files and exfiltrating their data stealthily, indicating malicious intent. The code does not perform destructive actions but compromises user privacy. The use of base64 URL encoding is a simple obfuscation technique. The code's behavior aligns with known malicious data theft activities. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.9, obfuscation ~0.8, security risk ~0.75-0.9) are appropriate given the activity. The activity is covert, targets sensitive data, and transmits it without user consent, justifying high risk and malware scores. The code's purpose is malicious, and the activity warrants high alert. Minor adjustments could be made to increase malware score slightly to 0.9 for consistency, but current scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs stealthy data exfiltration of sensitive user configuration files to a remote server, indicating malicious activity. The use of base64 URL obfuscation and silent operation further support this. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting high malware potential and security risk. The activity should be flagged as malicious, and further investigation is recommended.",
