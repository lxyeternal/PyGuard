{
  "purpose": "This code retrieves configuration data files from specific user directories, encodes a URL from a base64 string, and sends the collected data to a webhook URL obtained dynamically from an external source.",
  "sources": "Reading local configuration files (.json files) from user directories; fetching the webhook URL from a remote server via HTTP GET request.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected configuration files as multipart/form-data via HTTP POST to a potentially malicious webhook URL.",
  "flows": "The code decodes a URL from base64, makes an HTTP GET request to obtain the webhook URL, then reads local files, and finally posts the data to the remote webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically fetching webhook URL from a base64-encoded URL and then sending user configuration data without user consent or awareness; use of hardcoded base64 string; reading sensitive user configuration files from standard directories; no validation or sanitization of retrieved URL or files.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves a URL by decoding a base64-encoded string, then makes an HTTP GET request to that URL to obtain a webhook URL. It reads sensitive configuration files from common user directories related to gaming and account settings. If any files are present, it sends them via HTTP POST to the fetched webhook URL, which is potentially malicious or unknown. The process involves dynamic URL retrieval, which could be used for command-and-control, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The code does not contain obfuscation, but the intent to collect and send user data without explicit consent raises suspicion. The code appears designed to exfiltrate user account details stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its dynamic retrieval of a webhook URL, reading of sensitive user configuration files, and sending this data to an external server without user consent. It exhibits typical characteristics of data exfiltration malware, although it does not contain clear malicious commands beyond data theft. The overall security risk is high, and the behavior warrants caution and further review.",
