  "conclusion": "The code performs stealthy data exfiltration of sensitive user configuration files to a remote server, indicating malicious activity. The use of base64 URL obfuscation and silent operation further support this. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting high malware potential and security risk. The activity should be flagged as malicious, and further investigation is recommended."
