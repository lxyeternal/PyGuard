  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to a suspicious URL. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, and the scores are justified accordingly."
