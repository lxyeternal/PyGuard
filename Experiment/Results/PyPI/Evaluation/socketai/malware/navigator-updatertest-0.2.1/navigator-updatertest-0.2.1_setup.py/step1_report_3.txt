{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step to send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "The code sends a GET request to a remote server (https://ccqvib15v50h42949ip0kzxgeyonaaege.oast.pro) with the collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "On installation, the script collects system info (source) and immediately sends it via an HTTP GET request to the specified remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The network request is made during the package installation process, which is unusual and potentially malicious as it exfiltrates system info without user consent. The URL used is suspicious and appears to be a temporary or malicious domain. There are no other obfuscation or code hiding techniques.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with an overridden install command. During the install, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then performs an HTTP GET request to an external domain with these details as parameters. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity. The use of a suspicious URL indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, as this occurs transparently during package installation. No other malicious payloads or code injections are present. The code does not perform any harmful actions beyond sending data, but doing so without user consent during installation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation to an external server, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of a suspicious domain and data collection without user consent suggests malicious intent.",
