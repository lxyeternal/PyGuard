{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to extend the installation process of a Python package to include sending system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()) during installation.",
  "targets": "The requests.get() call sends collected system info to an external URL, potentially exposing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "During the install command, system information (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source functions to the requests.get() call, which transmits data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a network request that silently exfiltrates system information during package installation without user consent. No user warnings or prompts are present. The external URL is suspiciously structured and likely malicious or used for tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and extends the setup process with a custom install class. When the package is installed, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. These details are then sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. This behavior resembles a supply chain attack or data exfiltration, potentially tracking users or stealing info without consent. The URL appears malicious and unrelated to legitimate package functionality. No obfuscation or malicious code execution is present, but the silent exfiltration is highly suspicious and malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes a hidden mechanism to exfiltrate user system information during installation, indicating malicious behavior. It is highly likely to be used for tracking or data theft without user knowledge.",
