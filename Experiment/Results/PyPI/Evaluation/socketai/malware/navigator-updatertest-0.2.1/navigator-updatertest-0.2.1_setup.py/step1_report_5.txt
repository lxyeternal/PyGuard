  "flows": "Gather system info -> Send info via HTTP GET request to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Unusual network request during package installation; sending hostname, current directory, and username to an external server without clear user consent",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup process to include collecting hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes a GET request to an external URL with this data as parameters. This behavior resembles data exfiltration during installation, which is suspicious. No other malicious code such as file modifications, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors are present. The request URL appears to be a custom or possibly malicious domain, raising concerns about potential tracking or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a covert data collection mechanism during package installation, which can be considered malicious or at least privacy-invasive. It could be used for tracking users or exfiltrating system info without consent.",
