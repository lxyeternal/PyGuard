  "purpose": "Custom installation script that gathers system information during package installation and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via requests.get() to an external URL during installation.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system functions flows directly into the requests.get() call, transmitting to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information automatically during package installation without user consent. The URL used is suspicious and potentially malicious. No user prompt or warning. No obfuscated code or typical malicious indicators beyond data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after executing the standard install process, gathers hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL, passing this information as URL parameters. This behavior resembles a potential tracking or data exfiltration mechanism. The URL used appears suspicious and likely malicious, as it resembles a command-and-control or malicious server. No security issues with the data collection functions themselves, but their usage during package install indicates malicious intent or privacy violation. No obfuscation or malware-like code patterns are present beyond the data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a malicious component that exfiltrates system information during installation, indicating potentially harmful behavior. It should be considered high risk for supply chain attacks and privacy violations.",
