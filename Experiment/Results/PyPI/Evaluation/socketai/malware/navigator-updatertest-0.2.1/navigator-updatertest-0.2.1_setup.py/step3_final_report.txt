{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it silently to a suspicious external URL, indicating malicious data theft behavior.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() during the run method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to an external URL without user notification or consent.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are gathered in the run() method and passed as parameters to requests.get(), which transmits data to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration occurs during package installation without user awareness; the URL used is suspicious; no obfuscation or user prompts are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard install process, collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. This behavior indicates silent data exfiltration, a malicious activity. The URL is external and likely malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or destructive payloads. The signals—data collection during install and transmission to a suspicious domain—are consistent with malicious intent. The malware score is high (close to 1), reflecting the privacy invasion and potential for malicious tracking. The security risk score is also high, given the privacy violation and supply chain attack vector. Confidence in this assessment is high, as the behavior is clear and unambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to a suspicious URL. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, the package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious, and the scores are justified accordingly.",
