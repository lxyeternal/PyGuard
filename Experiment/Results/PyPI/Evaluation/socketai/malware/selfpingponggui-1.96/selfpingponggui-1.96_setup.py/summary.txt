  "conclusion": "The code contains high-risk, obfuscated PowerShell execution that likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing external payloads. The setup process appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the embedded malicious activity. The overall security risk is very high, warranting a malware score of 0.85, obfuscation score of 0.85, and security risk score of 0.9."
