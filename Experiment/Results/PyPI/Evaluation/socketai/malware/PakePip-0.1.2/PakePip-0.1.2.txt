      "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, executing a reverse shell during installation, with minimal obfuscation. It poses a critical security threat and should be flagged as highly malicious. The scores in the reports are justified; malware and security risk scores should be set to 1.0, with an obfuscation score around 0.6 reflecting the straightforward base64 encoding."
