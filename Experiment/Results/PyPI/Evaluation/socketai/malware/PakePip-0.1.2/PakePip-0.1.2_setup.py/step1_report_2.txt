{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines a custom installation process that executes a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded LHOST and LPORT variables, constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded base64 command via os.system, which runs the reverse shell payload.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded strings (LHOST, LPORT) -> formatted reverse shell command -> base64 encoding -> os.system decoding and execution.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of reverse shell code within a setup script, execution of system commands during package installation, base64 encoding of malicious payload, hardcoded connection details.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CustomInstall class that overrides the run method. Within run, it constructs a reverse shell command pointing to a remote server (LHOST and LPORT). The command is encoded in base64 and then decoded and executed immediately via os.system during package installation. This effectively creates a backdoor that connects to an external server when the package is installed, which is highly suspicious behavior. The malicious activity is embedded directly in the package setup process, indicating an intent to compromise systems where this package is installed.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, specifically executing a reverse shell connection during package installation, which constitutes a backdoor. It uses obfuscation via base64 encoding to hide the payload. This package should be considered malicious and unsafe to install.",
