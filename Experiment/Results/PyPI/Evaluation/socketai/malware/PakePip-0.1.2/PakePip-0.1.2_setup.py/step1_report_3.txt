{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process for a Python package that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specified remote host and port.",
  "sources": "The reverse_shell string, which contains the command to establish a reverse shell connection, and the LHOST, LPORT variables that specify the attacker's server details.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that decodes the base64-encoded reverse shell command and executes it in a shell environment, establishing a network connection to the attacker's server.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it through os.system, resulting in a network connection to the specified LHOST and LPORT when the package is installed.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded attacker server address and port; the use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the malicious command; execution of system shell commands during package installation; the description indicating exploitative behavior; no legitimate functionality related to the package's stated purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command in setuptools to run additional code during installation. It creates a reverse shell command intended to connect to a remote server, encodes it in base64, and then decodes and executes it via os.system, effectively establishing a backdoor. The presence of hardcoded malicious server details and obfuscated execution strongly suggests malicious intent. The overall design appears to be a supply chain attack vector, embedding malware within a seemingly benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code that, when installed, initiates a reverse shell connection to an attacker-controlled server, constituting a significant security risk. The code is intentionally obfuscated to conceal malicious behavior, and the setup description aligns with exploitative motives. The package should be considered highly malicious and unsafe to use.",
