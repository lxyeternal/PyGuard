{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to define a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads the LHOST and LPORT variables, constructs a reverse shell command, and encodes it in base64 before executing it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64 string, which runs a reverse shell command that connects to an external server.",
  "flows": "Source: LHOST and LPORT variables -> reverse_shell command -> base64 encoding -> os.system execution -> decoding and execution of reverse shell command.",
  "anomalies": "The code embeds a reverse shell payload directly into the installation process, which is highly unusual and suspicious for a setup script. It hardcodes the attacker’s server address and port, and executes encoded malicious code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. Inside run, it constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specified external server and port. The command is encoded in base64 and then decoded and executed via os.system, resulting in the establishment of a reverse shell upon installation. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it allows remote access to the system during package installation. The package metadata describes it as an exploit, further supporting malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward but intentionally includes dangerous code that compromises security.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a clear malicious payload that initiates a reverse shell connection to an external server during installation. The embedded reverse shell, hardcoded server address, and the obfuscated execution method strongly suggest malicious intent. The package is designed to compromise systems where it is installed, representing a serious security threat.",
