  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of the 'PakePip' package to include a reverse shell payload.",
  "sources": "LHOST and LPORT variables; the reverse_shell command string; the base64 encoded payload.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded base64 payload as a bash script.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The installation process contains an embedded reverse shell payload that connects to a remote server, which is unusual and malicious. Hardcoded attack server address and port; use of base64 encoding to obfuscate payload; execution of system commands during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon running, constructs a reverse shell command to connect back to a specified remote server. The command is then base64-encoded, decoded immediately, and executed with os.system. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish unauthorized remote access during package installation. The presence of hardcoded malicious server details and the use of obfuscation techniques are strong indicators of malicious intent. No benign functionality is present related to the package's described purpose, suggesting the entire setup is designed for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes a hidden malicious payload that establishes a reverse shell to an attacker-controlled server during installation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious. The package is likely intended for malicious remote access or control upon installation.",
