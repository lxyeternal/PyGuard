{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation script for a Python package, which includes a reverse shell payload executed during installation.",
  "sources": "LHOST and LPORT variables, base64 encoded reverse shell command, os.system execution",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the decoded base64 payload",
  "flows": "CustomInstall.run() method constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then executes it via os.system which decodes and runs the malicious command",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address (LHOST) and port (LPORT), executing a reverse shell payload during installation, encoding payload in base64 to obscure intent, modifying environment variables and spawning a bash shell",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools for package setup, then defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. Inside run(), it constructs a reverse shell command that connects to a remote host and port, then encodes this command in base64. It then executes a shell command that decodes the base64 string and runs it. This behavior effectively introduces a backdoor by establishing a remote control channel during package installation. Hardcoded network details and execution of a decoded payload strongly indicate malicious intent. No legitimate or benign reason for such behavior in a package setup script. The code actively runs malicious reverse shell code during installation, which is a serious security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell connection during installation, representing a significant security threat. The presence of hardcoded malicious network details, encoded payload, and execution during setup confirms its malicious intent.",
