The overall malware suspicion is low (0.2), obfuscation is moderate (0.7), and security risk is moderate (0.4). The assessments across reports are consistent, and no immediate threats are identified. Continued monitoring or static/dynamic analysis of Report 1's code is recommended to confirm or rule out malicious intent."
