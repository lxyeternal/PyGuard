{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be initializing a Python package by importing all contents from a module named 'api' and setting a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api import *, setting of __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling found",
  "flows": "No significant data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code only performs import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported content but is common in package __init__.py files; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a relative module 'api', which could hide potentially malicious code if present in 'api', but cannot be assessed here. The version string is a standard package attribute. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, external network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The minimal code structure suggests standard package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve as a package initializer with standard practices.",
