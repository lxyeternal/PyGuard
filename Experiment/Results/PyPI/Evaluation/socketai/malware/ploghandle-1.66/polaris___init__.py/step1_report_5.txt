{
  "purpose": "The code imports all components from a local module named 'api' and defines a version string, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api import *",
  "sinks": "Potentially the imported components could be used as sinks if they process untrusted data elsewhere, but no direct sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this snippet; the import may lead to other code that could process untrusted input, but this cannot be determined here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered a bad practice as it obscures imported entities, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports all entities from a local module 'api' and sets a version string. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or anomalies within this small snippet. Without additional context, no security issues or malicious intent can be identified. The use of wildcard import is a style concern but not a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears benign, primarily setting a version string and importing from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
