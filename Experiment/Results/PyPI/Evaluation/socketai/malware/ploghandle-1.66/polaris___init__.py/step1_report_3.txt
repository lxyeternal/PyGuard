{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'api' and sets a version string for the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api import *",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data output or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module into the current namespace; no further data flow is visible",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what is imported, but this is common in package init files; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a relative import from a module named 'api' and defining a version string. The import * pattern can hide specific imported elements, but in the context of package initialization, it is not inherently malicious. No input sources, data sinks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be part of a larger package setup, with no signs of malicious code or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple package initialization snippet, importing from a local module and setting a version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
