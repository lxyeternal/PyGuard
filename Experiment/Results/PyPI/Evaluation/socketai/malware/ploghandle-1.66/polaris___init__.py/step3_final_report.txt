  "flows": "Import from .api (source) to namespace (sink), setting __version__ (source) as part of package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols; minimal code with no explicit anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py pattern for a Python package, importing all symbols from a local module and setting a version string. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are visible. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'api' module, which is external and unexamined here. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not inherently malicious. Scores assigned in reports are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk (~0.15) reflecting potential risk if 'api' is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package boilerplate with minimal security concern. The main risk depends on the content of the 'api' module, which cannot be assessed here. The import pattern 'import *' is common but should be avoided for clarity. Overall, the code itself is safe, and the scores should reflect low risk.",
