{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a module named .api and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .api, which may load code or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the imported module could execute or define malicious functions, but no direct sink is evident here.",
  "flows": "The import might execute code from .api, but the code snippet itself does not process external data or pass data further.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .api import *' can be considered risky due to obscurity and potential for hidden behavior, but in itself, it does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module named .api and assigns a version string. The import statement could execute arbitrary code if the .api module contains malicious code, but the snippet alone does not reveal any malicious actions. The version string is harmless. The overall structure is minimal and standard for package initialization. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is minimal and appears to be standard package boilerplate. Without inspecting the contents of the .api module, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The import statement could introduce risks if the imported module is malicious, but based on this snippet alone, there are no explicit indicators of malicious intent.",
