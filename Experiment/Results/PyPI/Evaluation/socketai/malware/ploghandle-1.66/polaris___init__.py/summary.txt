  "conclusion": "The code is benign package boilerplate with minimal security concern. The main risk depends on the content of the 'api' module, which cannot be assessed here. The import pattern 'import *' is common but should be avoided for clarity. Overall, the code itself is safe, and the scores should reflect low risk."
