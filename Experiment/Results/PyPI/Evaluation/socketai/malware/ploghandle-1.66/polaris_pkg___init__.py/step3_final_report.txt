  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network functions, dynamic execution points, data flows from inputs to sinks.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file writes, environment variable access, eval or exec calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env/network) to sinks (system commands, network, file operations) via code execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (variable names, dynamic code execution), minimal or placeholder code, absence of explicit malicious functions, signs of suspicious data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in Report 1, which raises suspicion but no explicit malicious activity is confirmed. Other reports show minimal or no code, with no suspicious patterns or data flows. The scores assigned—obfuscation around 0.6-0.7 in Report 1, malware around 0.2, and low security risk—are consistent with the observed features. The absence of concrete malicious functions supports low malware and risk scores in other reports. Overall, the analysis aligns with the code features, and the scores reflect cautious suspicion where appropriate without overestimating threats.",
  "conclusion": "The reports generally provide accurate assessments. Report 1's signs of obfuscation justify a slightly higher malware and obfuscation score, but no definitive malicious activity is detected. Other reports correctly identify benign code with low risk. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
