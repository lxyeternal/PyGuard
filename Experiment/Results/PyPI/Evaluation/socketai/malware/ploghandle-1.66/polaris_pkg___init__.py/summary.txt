  "conclusion": "The reports generally provide accurate assessments. Report 1's signs of obfuscation justify a slightly higher malware and obfuscation score, but no definitive malicious activity is detected. Other reports correctly identify benign code with low risk. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the evidence."
