  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential obfuscated functions, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, environment variable reads.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data leading to eval/exec or network functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, use of eval/exec, suspicious import patterns, hardcoded credentials, minimal or empty code sections.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating moderate suspicion. No explicit malicious payloads are evident, but the presence of obfuscation and eval/exec warrants a moderate malware score. Benign code snippets with no suspicious patterns are correctly scored as low risk. Empty or straightforward code sections are appropriately scored as benign. The overall assessment aligns with the suspicion levels, with Report 1 justifying a higher malware and risk score, while others remain low. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors and potential threats.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.4 and a security risk around 0.55. Benign code is correctly scored as low risk. No adjustments are necessary; the scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
