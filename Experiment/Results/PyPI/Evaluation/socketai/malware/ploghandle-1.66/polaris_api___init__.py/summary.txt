  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.4 and a security risk around 0.55. Benign code is correctly scored as low risk. No adjustments are necessary; the scores are justified and consistent with the analysis."
