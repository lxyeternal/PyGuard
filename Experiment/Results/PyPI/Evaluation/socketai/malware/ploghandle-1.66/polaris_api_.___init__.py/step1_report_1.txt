  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or network transmission are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident, as this is metadata rather than executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of quarantine attributes and metadata is normal for downloaded files on Mac OS X; no unusual or suspicious behavior is observed. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
