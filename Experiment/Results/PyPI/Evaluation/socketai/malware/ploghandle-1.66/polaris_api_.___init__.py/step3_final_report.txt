  "purpose": "This code represents macOS quarantine extended attributes, specifically the 'com.apple.quarantine' metadata, indicating the file was downloaded from the internet.",
  "sources": "The data is static filesystem metadata, likely read from extended attributes of a file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the data does not flow into any vulnerable or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the data is metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the data is standard macOS quarantine metadata with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The data is a raw, static representation of macOS quarantine attributes, containing no executable code, scripts, or network activity. All reports correctly interpret this as benign metadata. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with the nature of the data. No logical errors or suspicious signals are present. The data's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any malicious indicators or obfuscation, and the scores reflect this accurately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign macOS quarantine metadata with no malicious or suspicious content. The current scores are appropriate and justified, indicating no security threat.",
