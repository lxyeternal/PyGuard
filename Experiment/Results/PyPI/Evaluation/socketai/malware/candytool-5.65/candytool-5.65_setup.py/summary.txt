  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during setup, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting caution. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as potentially malicious until further decoding of the payload confirms its purpose."
