      "conclusion": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated, silently executed PowerShell command during setup, which is a red flag for malicious activity. The behavior suggests potential for downloading or executing malicious payloads, warranting high security concern. The package should be treated as suspicious or malicious until further analysis confirms its safety."
