      "conclusion": "The code is a clear and straightforward reverse shell backdoor, executing immediately upon load, connecting to a hardcoded remote server, and providing remote command execution capabilities. It is unequivocally malicious, with high security risk. The reports correctly identify this behavior; the scores should be uniformly set to 1 for malware and security risk to reflect the severity."
