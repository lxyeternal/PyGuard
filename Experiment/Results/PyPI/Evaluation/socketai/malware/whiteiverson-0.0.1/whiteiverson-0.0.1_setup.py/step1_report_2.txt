{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, which includes executing code during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1017200441387401297/1020792257722466425/MCCheat.exe' and saves the response content to 'MCCheat.exe'.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is run with 'os.system' using 'set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start MCCheat.exe'.",
  "flows": "The script downloads 'MCCheat.exe' from the URL (source) and then executes it via system command (sink), during package installation or development setup (triggered by run methods).",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link and runs it silently, which is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. The executable name 'MCCheat.exe' suggests malicious intent, such as cheating or malware.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports necessary modules, defines a download URL, and executes a function 'execute()' during installation or development commands. The 'execute' function downloads an executable from a Discord CDN URL and runs it using 'os.system', setting an environment variable '__COMPACT_LAYER' with 'RunAsInvoker' and starting the executable. This behavior is unusual and dangerous in package setup scripts, indicating potential malware delivery or backdoor installation. The executable's name and source point toward malicious intent. No other malicious or suspicious code is present. This is a clear supply chain attack vector, as the package will download and run external code during install.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, representing a supply chain attack vector and malware delivery mechanism. It should be considered extremely dangerous and should not be used.",
