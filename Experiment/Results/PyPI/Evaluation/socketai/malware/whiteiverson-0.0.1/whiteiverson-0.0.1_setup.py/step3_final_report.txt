{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL during package setup and runs it without validation, indicating malicious intent and a supply chain attack.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...' used in requests.get(), and the open() function writing 'MCCheat.exe'.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing 'start MCCheat.exe' which runs the downloaded executable.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the executable from the URL, saved via open(), then os.system() executes the file.",
  "anomalies": "Download and execution of an external executable during setup without validation, using a suspicious filename and URL, indicating malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script's execute() function downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link and runs it via os.system() during setup commands. The filename 'MCCheat.exe' and the URL strongly suggest malicious intent. No validation or user consent is present. The behavior constitutes a supply chain attack, risking system compromise. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but malicious. All signals point to high maliciousness and security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external, unverified executable during package installation, representing a severe supply chain security threat. The malware score is 1, security risk is 1, obfuscation is 0, and confidence is high.",
