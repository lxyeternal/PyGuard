{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, which also includes code that downloads and executes an external executable file from a Discord CDN URL during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input directly; however, it downloads content from a remote URL within the 'execute()' function, which is called during package setup.",
  "sinks": "The 'execute()' function writes the downloaded content to 'MCCheat.exe' and then executes it via 'os.system'.",
  "flows": "Remote URL response → saves as 'MCCheat.exe' → executes 'MCCheat.exe' with system call",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads a potentially malicious executable from an external source and runs it automatically during package setup, which is highly suspicious. The URL points to a Discord CDN link with a filename 'MCCheat.exe', indicating likely malicious intent. The execution of this file could perform harmful actions on the host system.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that, during installation or development, downloads an external executable from a Discord CDN link. It then executes this file with elevated command, which could be malicious malware or a backdoor. No user consent or validation is performed before execution, indicating malicious behavior. The rest of the setup code appears standard and benign but is overshadowed by this malicious payload. The use of 'os.system' to run the downloaded executable is a significant security risk, especially given the URL and filename, which suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload that downloads and executes a suspicious executable during package installation. This indicates a high probability of malicious behavior and a severe security risk.",
