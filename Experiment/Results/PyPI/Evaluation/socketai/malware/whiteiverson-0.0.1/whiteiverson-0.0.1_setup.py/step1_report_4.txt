{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that, during installation or development setup, downloads and executes an external executable file from a Discord CDN link.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; it also imports modules like getpass, os, time, requests, and uses them to gather environment information and download external content.",
  "sinks": "The response.content from the HTTP request is written directly to 'MCCheat.exe' and then executed via os.system with potentially malicious command to run the downloaded executable.",
  "flows": "Input source is the URL where the executable is downloaded. The flow proceeds from the download (requests.get) to writing the file, then to executing the file with os.system, which runs an external executable potentially containing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual activity includes downloading an executable from a suspicious Discord CDN URL and immediately executing it without any verification, which is highly suspicious. The script runs commands that can escalate to executing arbitrary code or malicious payloads. Use of 'os.system' with external input is risky, but in this context, it executes a hardcoded file.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup tool that, during package installation or development setup, downloads a specific executable from a remote source and executes it, which is highly suspicious. The URL appears to point to a potentially malicious or unwanted binary ('MCCheat.exe'). The script does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file. The use of 'os.system' to run this executable raises significant security concerns. Other parts of the code are standard setup procedures and do not contain malicious code. The overall behavior indicates an attempt to install and run an external program during setup, which could be malicious or intended for sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by downloading and executing a remote executable during the setup process, indicating a high security risk. It could be used to compromise the host system or perform malicious activities. The overall malware score is high, and the security risk is critical.",
