  "obfuscated": 0.9,

  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command execution triggered conditionally. The evidence supports a high malware and risk assessment. It should be treated as potentially malicious pending further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell command."
