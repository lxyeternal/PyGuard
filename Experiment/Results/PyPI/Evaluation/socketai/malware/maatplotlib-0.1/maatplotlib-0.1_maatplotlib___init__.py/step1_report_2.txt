{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be designed for a generic utility or application logic, but without specific context, its purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables and possibly from user input or configuration files, though explicit input sources are not clearly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or executing system commands if present, but no explicit sinks are identified from the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources to processing functions, and potentially to output or system calls, but specific flow paths are not clearly visible in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are immediately evident. The code uses standard Python features without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. It lacks any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No unusual language features or obfuscation are present. Due to the absence of complex logic or hidden behaviors, the risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code seems safe, but due to limited context, some risks cannot be completely ruled out.",
