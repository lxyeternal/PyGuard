{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform basic data processing and module imports without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and reads input data, likely from function parameters or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Data output or network communication if present, but no explicit untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through processing functions to output or external communication points, but no malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard module usage and data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is very low. Confidence is moderate to high given the limited context, and the code's benign nature is consistent across the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The scores reflect a low threat level, and the assessments are justified based on the available information.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
