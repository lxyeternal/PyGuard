      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious activity, decrypting and executing hidden code during installation on Windows. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and dynamic execution pattern are typical of malicious backdoors. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned high scores are justified. This package should be considered highly suspicious or malicious, and usage should be avoided until the payload can be fully analyzed and verified as benign."
