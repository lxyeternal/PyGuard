{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, with additional functions that collect system information and send it to an external server, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from os.getlogin(), os.uname()[1], and os.getcwd() to gather user login info, system hostname, and current working directory.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via URL requests using urlopen() to an external domain, and via os.system() executing a curl command to another suspicious domain.",
  "flows": "The functions send(), send2(), and send3() collect system info and send it to external servers. send() and send2() encode data and include it in URL parameters, then send via urlopen(). send3() executes a shell command to fetch data from a URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects sensitive system info and transmits it to external servers without user consent. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, hiding potential issues. The function names and behavior resemble typical data exfiltration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is embedded in a setup process, which triggers functions that exfiltrate system information to external domains. The data includes login name, system hostname, and current directory, encoded with base64. The use of multiple methods (urlopen and curl via os.system) for data transmission indicates an attempt to ensure data leaks even if one method is blocked. This pattern is characteristic of malicious data exfiltration behavior embedded within legitimate package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting system information to external servers during package installation. The functions are designed to run automatically as part of the install process, indicating intent to gather data without user knowledge. Overall, this code has a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
