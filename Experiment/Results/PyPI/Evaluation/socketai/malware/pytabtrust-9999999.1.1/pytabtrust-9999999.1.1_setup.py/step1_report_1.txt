{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a post-installation action during package setup, specifically to send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system information such as user login, hostname, and current working directory via os.getlogin(), os.uname(), and os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Sends data to external URLs via urlopen() and os.system() executing a curl command.",
  "flows": "Data from system calls (sources) is encoded with base64 and sent via HTTP requests in functions send() and send2(). send3() makes a system call to curl to access a remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except blocks to silently suppress errors, includes obfuscated URL domains, encodes sensitive information in base64, and sends system data without user consent. The URLs and data collection behavior suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that gather system information (user login, hostname, current directory) and transmit this data to external servers. send() and send2() encode and send user and system details to a suspicious domain, while send3() accesses a remote URL via curl. These operations occur during package installation within a custom post-install command. The use of silent exception handling and encoding indicates an attempt to obfuscate malicious data exfiltration. The URLs point to potentially malicious servers, and the behavior resembles data theft or reconnaissance activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to external servers during package installation, likely without user consent. The obfuscated URLs, silent error handling, and data collection mechanisms strongly suggest malicious intent. Therefore, this package should be considered highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
