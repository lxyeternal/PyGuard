  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a remote server during the installation process of a Python package.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urlopen() calls to external domains, os.system() execution of curl command",
  "flows": "Data from getlogin(), uname(), and getcwd() are encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to external server; also, system call executes curl to fetch external content",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple try-except blocks to suppress errors, sending encoded system info to suspicious domains, executing shell commands during install",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries but uses them for malicious purposes by collecting login, system, and current directory info and exfiltrating it to a remote server. The functions send(), send2(), and send3() encode sensitive info and send it without user consent. The setup class hooks into the installation process to trigger these functions automatically, indicating an intent to exfiltrate data during package installation. The use of obfuscated URLs and silent error handling suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to secretly gather and transmit user and system information during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. It exfiltrates sensitive data to external servers and executes external commands covertly.",
