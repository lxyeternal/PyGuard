{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'pytabtrust' and includes functions that exfiltrate system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urlopen() calls sending data to external URL, os.system() executing curl command",
  "flows": "System information retrieved via os.getlogin(), os.uname(), os.getcwd() are encoded and sent via HTTP requests to an external domain. Additionally, os.system() executes a curl command to another domain.",
  "anomalies": "Functions send(), send2(), and send3() covertly transmit sensitive system information to external servers. Use of bare except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding malicious activity. The setup script triggers data exfiltration during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that encode system login, hostname, and current working directory data using base64, then send this data to a remote URL using urlopen. The send3() function executes a curl command to another external URL, likely for additional malicious activity. The PostInstallCommand class overrides the install process to invoke these data exfiltration functions during package installation. The code structure and functions suggest an intent to covertly collect and transmit user and system information without user awareness, consistent with malicious behavior. The hardcoded URLs and encoding methods are typical of malware trying to avoid detection. There are no signs of obfuscation or other suspicious coding techniques beyond these malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains embedded malicious functions designed to exfiltrate system information to external servers during installation, indicating high malicious intent. It should be considered malicious and should not be used.",
