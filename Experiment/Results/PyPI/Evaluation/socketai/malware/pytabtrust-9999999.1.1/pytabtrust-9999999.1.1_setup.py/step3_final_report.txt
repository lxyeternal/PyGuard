{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (login, hostname, current directory) and exfiltrates it to external servers during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.uname()[1], os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls, os.system() executing curl command",
  "flows": "Data from sources is base64-encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests or executed through shell commands to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "Silent try-except blocks hiding errors, use of base64 encoding for data, execution of external commands during setup, suspicious hardcoded URLs",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions that gather sensitive system info and exfiltrate it during installation using network requests and shell commands. The data is encoded with base64, and the URLs are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity. Silent error handling prevents detection of failures. The functions are invoked during the custom install process, making the exfiltration automatic and covert. The URLs point to suspicious domains, and the overall behavior aligns with data theft or reconnaissance malware. The obfuscation level is minimal, primarily base64 encoding, which is easily reversible. The malicious activity is clear and deliberate, with high confidence in its malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits active data exfiltration during package installation, with minimal obfuscation and silent error handling, strongly indicating malicious behavior. The behavior aligns with malware aimed at covertly stealing system information, justifying high malware and security risk scores.",
