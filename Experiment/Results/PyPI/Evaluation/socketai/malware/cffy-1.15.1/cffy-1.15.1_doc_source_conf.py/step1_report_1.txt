  "purpose": "Configuration file for Sphinx documentation builder, used to set up documentation build parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules; reads configuration variables for Sphinx setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; the code consists solely of standard configuration settings for documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os modules but only uses them in commented-out or non-executing lines. All active code consists of variable assignments for configuring Sphinx documentation parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external communications. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation patterns are present. The structure and content are typical for a configuration script. The file does not perform any operations that could be malicious or sabotage in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and intended for setting up documentation build parameters.",
