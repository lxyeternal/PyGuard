  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation builder, setting various project and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules, variable assignments for configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration with no data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of imports not used in active code, but typical for configuration files; no suspicious patterns or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no dynamic code, network activity, or handling of sensitive data. Imports are unused but common in such configs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All variables are static, and the code contains only comments and configuration settings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file for documentation purposes. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present.",
