  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generation for the CFFI project.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and os modules; reads project metadata and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> sets configuration variables -> no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file generated by sphinx-quickstart. It imports common modules, sets up various documentation options, themes, and output formats. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No untrusted data sources or dangerous sinks are involved. The code is static and straightforward, serving purely as configuration without executing external or malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard configuration file for documentation setup. It does not contain malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is safe for use and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
