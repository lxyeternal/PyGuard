  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation with Sphinx for the CFFI project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os), configuration variables, and lists defining the documentation build settings.",
  "sinks": "No typical security-sensitive sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable usages identified.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets configuration variables without data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code strictly manages static configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. It imports sys and os but does not utilize them in any malicious manner. All variables are static configuration settings for documentation generation. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or other security-sensitive actions. The code's structure is typical for a documentation setup and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, static configuration file with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines documentation build settings for the CFFI project.",
