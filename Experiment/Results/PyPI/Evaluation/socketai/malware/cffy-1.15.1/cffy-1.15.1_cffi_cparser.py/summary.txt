  "malware_score": 0,
  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated static parser for C source code, with complex preprocessing routines that could be misused for obfuscation but do not indicate malicious behavior. No malware or sabotage is detected. The overall security risk is low, and the current scores are appropriate."
