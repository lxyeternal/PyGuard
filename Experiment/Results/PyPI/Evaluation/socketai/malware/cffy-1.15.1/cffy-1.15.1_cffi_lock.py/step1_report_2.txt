  "purpose": "To import the thread locking mechanism depending on Python version, with additional commented-out code defining a custom lock class.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys._getframe, import statements for thread modules",
  "sinks": "sys._getframe, import statements",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> import logic -> sys._getframe -> commented custom class",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code that redefines lock behavior; no active malicious code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports thread lock objects based on the Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. The commented-out section appears to define a custom lock class that logs call frames and asserts conditions but is inactive. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors, is present. The use of sys._getframe is standard for debugging or introspection, not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility layer for thread locking, with an unused, commented-out custom class. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues are detected.",
