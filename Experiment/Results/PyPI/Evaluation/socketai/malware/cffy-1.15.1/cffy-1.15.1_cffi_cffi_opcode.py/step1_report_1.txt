{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class and functions for handling CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface) operations and constants related to C data types and operations, likely for use in generating or manipulating C code or expressions within a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, class attributes, and global constants. It does not process external input data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks like network calls, file writes, or system commands are present. The code only formats and returns strings representing C expressions or data bytes.",
  "flows": "The class methods generate string expressions based on internal attributes. There are no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code appears to be straightforward in defining constants, class methods, and helper functions. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily defining constants, a class for representing CFFI operations, and a helper function for formatting bytes. It relies on global variables for class name mapping and constants for operation types and data primitives. The class methods perform straightforward string formatting and data manipulation with basic assertions and error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, external data processing, or potentially harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard utility module for handling CFFI expressions and related constants. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and functions as expected for its purpose.",
