{
  "purpose": "Defines classes, constants, and utility functions for handling CFFI expressions, types, and formatting in Python.",
  "sources": "Class constructor, as_c_expr method, as_python_bytes method, format_four_bytes function, constants definitions, and class-level mappings.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in as_c_expr and as_python_bytes, exception raising in as_python_bytes, data serialization via format_four_bytes.",
  "flows": "Input data (op, arg) processed through methods, formatted into strings or bytes, with exception handling for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for CFFI expression handling, involving string formatting, constant definitions, and simple class methods. No external input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The exception handling is standard for validation. The constants and class mappings are static and well-defined. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, infrastructural utility module for CFFI operations with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, transparent, and safe for use in larger projects.",
