  "purpose": "Builds a Python extension module using distutils, conditionally including the extension based on environment.",
  "sources": "Imports configuration variables from setup module; reads environment variables via sys.builtin_module_names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables from setup module flow into Extension parameters; environment check influences extension inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard build script with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for compiling a Python extension module, importing configuration from a local setup module, and conditionally including the extension based on whether the environment is PyPy. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident. The reports provided are empty, offering no additional context or claims. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for a build process. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. Therefore, the security assessment indicates no threat from this code snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
