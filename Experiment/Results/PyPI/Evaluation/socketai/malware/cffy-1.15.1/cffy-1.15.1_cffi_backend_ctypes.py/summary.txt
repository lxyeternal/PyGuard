  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex ctypes-based FFI utility designed for low-level C data interaction. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential for misuse leading to memory corruption or security vulnerabilities if untrusted data is processed without proper validation. The overall security posture is moderate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score around 0.5."
