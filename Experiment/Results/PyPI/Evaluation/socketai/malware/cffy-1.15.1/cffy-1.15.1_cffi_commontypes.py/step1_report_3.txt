{
  "purpose": "The code defines and manages common C types for use with a Foreign Function Interface (FFI), handling type resolution and platform-specific types for Windows.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, model, and FFIError; attempts to import _get_common_types from _cffi_backend; reads COMMON_TYPES dictionary, model.PrimitiveType.ALL_PRIMITIVE_TYPES, and sys.platform; accesses and modifies COMMON_TYPES and _CACHE; defines functions resolve_common_type and win_common_types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, populating COMMON_TYPES, resolving types through resolve_common_type, and defining platform-specific types. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no obfuscated code, suspicious control flows, or unusual code patterns. It uses dynamic type resolution but in a typical manner for FFI setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type definitions and resolves types based on platform and input parameters. It handles platform-specific types for Windows and manages a cache for type resolution. No external data is processed beyond importing modules and handling internal type data. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no indications of malware activities such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for FFI type management, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions as a utility module for type handling in a larger project, and the implementation appears legitimate and safe.",
