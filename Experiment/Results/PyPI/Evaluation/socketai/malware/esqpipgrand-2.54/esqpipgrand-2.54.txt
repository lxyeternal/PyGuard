      "conclusion": "The code contains a conditional, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed silently during package setup, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The setup code itself is standard, but the embedded payload raises significant security concerns. The current analysis and scores reflect a high likelihood of malicious activity, requiring further investigation of the payload."
