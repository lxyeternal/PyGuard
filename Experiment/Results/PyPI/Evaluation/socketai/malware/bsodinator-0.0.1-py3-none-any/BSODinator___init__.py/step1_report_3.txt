{
  "purpose": "The code appears to contain multiple utility functions for downloading images, creating and deleting files, spamming terminals or command prompts, shutting down the system, causing crashes, and opening browsers.",
  "sources": "User input (ShutdownOnStart), file system operations (Create_Files, Delete_Files), network requests (requests.get), webbrowser.open_new, os.system calls, environment variables (os.getenv), subprocess control (multiprocessing.Process)",
  "sinks": "File writing (DANGER.py, created files), system commands execution (os.system), process spawning, web browser invocation, system shutdown commands",
  "flows": "Input from user in ShutdownOnStart flows to file creation and system shutdown commands; URL in Multiple_img_Downloader flows to network response; webbrowser.open_new flows to opening URLs; os.system calls flow to executing command-line commands and scripts; create/delete files and directories flow to filesystem modifications",
  "anomalies": "ShutdownOnStart function writes a shutdown script and attempts to compile and move it, potentially malicious; Delete_Files function attempts to remove all files and directories recursively without filtering; Multiple_img_Downloader spawns many processes for network requests, possibly creating resource exhaustion; Crash_by_Numbers causes infinite loop with large memory allocations; Open_BrowserWins opens multiple browser tabs potentially causing nuisance or DoS",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions that perform potentially harmful actions, such as shutting down the system, deleting all files, spawning numerous processes, and opening many web browsers. The ShutdownOnStart function writes a shutdown script that executes immediately, which is malicious. Delete_Files recursively removes all files and directories, risking data loss. Multiple_img_Downloader uses multiprocessing to download many images concurrently, which could cause resource exhaustion. Crash_by_Numbers creates an infinite loop with exponential memory growth, leading to system instability. Open_BrowserWins opens numerous browser tabs, potentially causing inconvenience or DoS. The code overall exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious intent, especially the shutdown and recursive delete functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains multiple functions with malicious potential, including system shutdown, mass file deletion, resource exhaustion, and nuisance actions like spam and browser flooding. The shutdown function is particularly dangerous, with direct system shutdown commands and malicious script creation. Overall, the code demonstrates high malicious intent and security risk.",
