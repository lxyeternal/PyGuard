{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for various potentially disruptive or malicious activities, including mass downloading, file creation and deletion, spawning numerous processes, launching browsers, and a shutdown routine.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user input for confirmation and environment variables for username; external URL requests for image downloading; potentially untrusted data in requests and system commands.",
  "sinks": "System commands execution via os.system, process spawning, file operations including deletion and creation, process spawning for browsers and terminals, and shutdown command.",
  "flows": "User input triggers shutdown sequence; external URL data is fetched and saved as images; process spawning and web browser opening are initiated; the shutdown code writes and executes a script that halts the system.",
  "anomalies": "Massive loops creating thousands of processes or files; deleting all files with shutil.rmtree on the current directory; creating a script that shuts down the machine; spawning browsers and terminals excessively; potential misuse of os.system with commands that could be disruptive.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions that perform resource exhaustion (mass process creation, file writing, browser spawning), destructive actions (shutdown script, deletion of files), and potentially harmful system modifications. The shutdown function writes a script to execute system shutdown, which is a clear malicious intent. The use of mass spawning of processes and opening browsers repeatedly could be used to cause denial of service or system instability. The code does not perform any benign or constructive tasks, indicating malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent, including system disruption and shutdown capabilities, along with resource exhaustion. It is designed to perform harmful actions on the host system, qualifying as malware with high security risk. The overall security risk score is high, and the malware likelihood is also high.",
