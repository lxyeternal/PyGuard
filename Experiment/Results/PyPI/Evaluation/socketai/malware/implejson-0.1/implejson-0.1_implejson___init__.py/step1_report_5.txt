  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python script intended to perform data processing or communication with external services, but the specific purpose cannot be determined due to missing or incomplete code snippets.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely read from environment variables, file reads, network requests, or user inputs, though specific sources are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communications (HTTP requests), writing to files, executing system commands, or handling sensitive data such as credentials or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions, possibly leading to sinks like network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are detected due to incomplete code snippet. Lack of context limits detection of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code was not provided in its entirety; thus, detailed analysis is limited. The structure suggests typical data handling procedures. No clear indicators of malicious intent such as suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are apparent. The lack of specific functions or operations prevents thorough assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there are no definitive signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but incomplete data limits full evaluation. Caution is advised if further context reveals sensitive operations.",
