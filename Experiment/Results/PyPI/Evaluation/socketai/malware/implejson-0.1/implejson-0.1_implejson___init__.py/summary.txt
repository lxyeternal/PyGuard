  "conclusion": "Overall, the reports are reasonable and cautious, correctly noting the absence of code and avoiding unwarranted suspicion. Minor score adjustments are recommended to better align suspicion levels with the lack of concrete evidence, particularly reducing malware and obfuscation scores in reports 3 and 4 from moderate to minimal. The overall security posture remains low risk."
