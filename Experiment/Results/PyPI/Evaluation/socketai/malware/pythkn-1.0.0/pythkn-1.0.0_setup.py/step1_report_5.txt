{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'pythkn' and overrides the installation process to include potentially malicious code execution on Windows systems during installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment information (os.name), imports requests and fernet modules, and decrypts and executes decrypted code using Fernet.",
  "sinks": "Executes decrypted code via exec(), which can run arbitrary code, leading to remote code execution or malicious payload execution during package installation.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the code imports modules, decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload, and executes it, possibly leading to malicious actions on the host system.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated long description, unusually named class and variables, use of Fernet decryption and exec() during install, which can be malicious. The long description appears random or nonsensical, suggesting obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package setup with standard fields, but includes an overridden install command that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports requests and Fernet, decrypts an encrypted payload, and executes it. The encrypted string and the use of exec() strongly indicate potential malicious activity, such as executing remote code or installing backdoors. The obfuscated variables and the long description further suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code does not appear to perform any legitimate setup functions beyond package installation but instead executes hidden code during install on Windows platforms.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload executed during package installation on Windows systems, with obfuscated and suspicious code patterns. It appears designed to run malicious code secretly, representing a high security risk.",
