  "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits clear malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads, obfuscation, and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious intent. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified and consistent with the observed behavior. This package poses a significant security threat and should be flagged as malicious and avoided."
