{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'pythkn' with specific metadata and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data, environment details, and includes an embedded encrypted payload within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes decrypted code via exec() upon installation, which could be malicious if the payload is harmful.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows (nt), the code imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload, and executes it via exec(), creating a source-to-sink flow of decrypted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of an encrypted payload executed during installation, use of exec() with decrypted content, and obfuscated variable names suggest suspicious behavior. The encrypted string is not decodable without the key, but its usage is concerning.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package. It includes a custom install class that, when run on Windows systems, imports requests and cryptography's Fernet, then decrypts and executes a payload. The encrypted payload and key are embedded in the code. The decryption and execution of code during package installation on Windows is unusual and potentially malicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution, possibly for malicious purposes. The rest of the code appears standard, but the encrypted payload's execution poses a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious payload that is decrypted and executed during installation on Windows, indicating likely malicious behavior. The encrypted payload and use of exec() are classic indicators of malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The package should be considered dangerous until the payload is further analyzed and verified safe.",
