  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, suspicious constructs, and potential malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, untrusted input, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), imported modules, hardcoded secrets, network or file I/O, complex control flows.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically generated code, network communication, access to environment variables, file modifications, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, suspicious import patterns, complex or obfuscated code, dynamic code generation, unvalidated inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. Suspicious constructs like eval/exec with untrusted data, complex control flows, and obfuscated strings increase suspicion. The presence of hardcoded credentials and unvalidated inputs further elevates security concerns. The code's structure suggests potential for malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The scores assigned reflect the suspicion level, with higher malware and risk scores correlating with more suspicious patterns. The confidence level is moderate to high, given the described behaviors and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows significant signs of malicious or insecure behavior, especially in reports with eval/exec usage, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation. The scores are consistent with these findings, indicating moderate to high security risks. No false positives are evident, and the assessments align with typical indicators of malicious activity.",
