  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'websckets' package with obfuscated conditional logic and potential malicious code execution paths.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line argument; environment variables via os.getenv; filesystem operations with os.path and os.makedirs; potential dynamic imports and file manipulations; obfuscated string constructions for module names and functions.",
  "sinks": "Calling pip.main() with dynamically constructed arguments; importing win32com and Dispatch; creating shortcuts with CreateShortcut; filesystem manipulations with open, write, close, and os operations; environment variable access; os.makedirs and os.path functions.",
  "flows": "Input via sys.argv influences conditional branches; obfuscated code triggers pip installation or environment variable access; dynamic module import and shortcut creation; file and environment variable interactions under conditional branches; possible filesystem and system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated, dynamically generated strings and code, including complex bitwise and shifting operations; nested, obscure conditionals with large, nonsensical numerical calculations; use of non-standard variable names with characters from East Asian scripts; presence of code that manipulates system files, creates shortcuts, and imports system modules conditionally; inclusion of suspicious conditional execution paths that could perform privilege escalation or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated using complex bitwise operations, dynamic string generation, and nested conditional logic. The initial segment checks the platform and command-line arguments with obfuscated string constructions, then performs arbitrary calculations assigning to variables with East Asian character names. It contains code that can invoke pip's main function, import Windows-specific modules, create system shortcuts, and manipulate filesystem paths—often under complex, hard-to-read conditions. There are also multiple points where environment variables are accessed, and system directories are created or modified. These behaviors could be used to execute malicious system modifications, install packages, or exfiltrate data, especially given the conditional triggers based on specific numerical checks and environment states. The entire code seems designed to hide malicious payloads or system manipulation logic behind layers of obfuscation and complex calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly obfuscated and contains code that could perform system modifications, install packages, and manipulate system files covertly. The combination of dynamic imports, filesystem operations, environment variable access, and conditional execution based on obscure calculations suggests malicious intent or sabotage. Due to the obfuscation and potential for system compromise, this package should not be trusted or used.",
