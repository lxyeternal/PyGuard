{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python package named 'websckets' with version '0.1'. It primarily includes a setup configuration for packaging the module.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.getenv), command-line arguments (sys.argv), and files or directories via os.path functions. There are also multiple dynamic import statements (pip, os, ctypes, win32com) and a large amount of obfuscated numerical expressions. The environment variables and command-line arguments are used as input sources.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to files using write() and creates shortcuts or directories with potential file system access. It also executes code via os.system-like calls (implied by potential shutil or os.walk/expanding paths). The use of os.getenv suggests possible data leakage. External modules like 'pip', 'os', 'ctypes', 'win32com' are imported dynamically, which could be used for system manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input flows from environment variables, command-line arguments, and file system reads potentially lead to file writes, directory creation, or system-level modifications. The obfuscated computations set variables that control flow, including potential conditions for malicious actions such as creating shortcuts, saving files, or directory manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, complex bitwise and arithmetic expressions, and dynamic import statements that are conditionally executed based on obscure calculations. There are code segments that import system modules and attempt to modify files or directories conditionally, and some code involving ctypes and win32com indicates potential system-level actions. The use of dynamically generated strings with 'getattr' and 'map' to obscure function calls and parameters is suspicious. The obfuscation strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious intents.",
  "analysis": "The initial part of the code performs complex and deliberately obfuscated computations to generate strings and control flow. The code dynamically imports modules like pip, os, ctypes, and win32com based on computed conditions. It manipulates environment variables, attempts to create or delete files, directories, or shortcuts, and even checks for admin privileges via ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin(). There are multiple points where data could leak (via environment variables, file writes, or system calls). The code also performs directory traversals and conditional executions based on obscure numeric comparisons, typical in malware to evade detection. The pattern of heavily obfuscated code with meaningless variable names and complex calculations points toward malicious intent, possibly concealed as legitimate setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains significant obfuscation designed to hide malicious behaviors. It dynamically interacts with the file system, environment variables, and system modules. The presence of system privilege checks and file operations suggests potential sabotage or malicious system modification. The code structure and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious intent, likely to perform system sabotage, data exfiltration, or covert system modifications. The package name 'websckets' with a typo and the suspicious code structure warrant caution.",
