  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload execution during package setup, with indicators of malicious intent such as URL embedding, silent execution, and obfuscation. The scores reflect a high likelihood of malware and security risk. It should be treated as malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise."
