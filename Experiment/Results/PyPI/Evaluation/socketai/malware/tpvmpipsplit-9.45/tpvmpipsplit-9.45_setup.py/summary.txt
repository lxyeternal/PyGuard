  "conclusion": "The script contains highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell code executed silently, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation, hidden execution, and suspicious URL strongly suggest the presence of malware or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be treated as potentially compromised. Further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm its payload."
