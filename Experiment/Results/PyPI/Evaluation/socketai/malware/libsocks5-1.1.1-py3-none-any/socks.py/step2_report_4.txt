  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code's content.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxy clients.\n- Handles proxy negotiation, authentication, connection, and data transfer.\n- Uses standard libraries, protocols, and error handling.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- No dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors.\n- Supports both local and remote DNS resolution.\n- Provides mechanisms for setting default proxies and wrapping modules.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard SOCKS proxy client, handles connection and negotiation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, proper protocol adherence, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, given standard functionality)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard, legitimate proxy client with no malicious intent. The logic is sound, and the score seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Implements SOCKS proxy client library, supports connection setup and negotiation.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, proper credential encoding, standard protocols.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's content. No signs of malicious behavior, and the reasoning is solid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy socket implementation supporting multiple protocols.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, standard negotiation, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a typical proxy client, and the report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Proxy client for SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, standard proxy handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard implementation with no malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** SOCKS proxy client supporting various proxies with authentication.\n- **Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, standard protocols, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Comparison & Critical Evaluation\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?** No. All reports agree.\n- **Obfuscation?** None detected.\n- **Credential handling?** Proper encoding, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Protocol adherence?** Yes, all negotiation steps follow standards.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** Limited to misconfiguration or misuse, but not malicious code.\n\n### Scores Justification\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. No malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, around 0.1-0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse if configured maliciously but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's content: **legitimate, standard proxy client implementation.**\n- No adjustments needed for scores; they are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1-0.2** (low, mainly potential misuse if misconfigured)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate SOCKS proxy client library with no signs of malicious intent. It operates within expected protocols and standards, and the reports' evaluations are accurate.",
