  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP, with proper handling of negotiation, authentication, and error cases.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Credential encoding is basic (ASCII + base64), which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent with a legitimate proxy client.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on proper protocol handling, credential encoding, and no malicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard proxy negotiation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SOCKS proxy client.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard proxy socket implementation supporting multiple protocols, with proper exception handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard protocol adherence.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Implements a SOCKS proxy client, with standard handling, no malicious features.\n- **Findings:** No secrets, no obfuscation, standard network operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — very low, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate proxy client.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard SOCKS proxy client with proper handling.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. The code is a standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No evident logical flaws or security issues. The code handles negotiation, authentication, and error cases properly.\n- **Scores review:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Obfuscated scores are 0, which is accurate. Risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical proxy client risk, mainly if misused.\n- **Malware justification:** No malicious activity detected. The code does not exfiltrate data, execute remote commands, or contain backdoors.\n- **Assumption-based vulnerabilities:** None. The analysis relies on standard protocol behavior and proper credential handling.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores are consistent with the reports' findings.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (appropriate, given the potential misuse of proxy features but no inherent maliciousness)\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (a conservative, low risk, acknowledging potential misuse but no inherent malicious features)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a SOCKS proxy client with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It adheres to protocol standards and handles credentials securely in context.",
