{
  "purpose": "The code provides an implementation of a SOCKS proxy client for Python, enabling applications to connect through various proxy types (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP) with support for authentication and different addressing modes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided proxy parameters (proxy type, address, port, username, password), destination addresses (hostnames or IPs), and socket connection calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects occur at network socket operations, including sending proxy authentication details, HTTP headers, or forwarding data through proxy connections. No explicit data exfiltration or malicious data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from user parameters and hostname resolution flow through methods like set_proxy(), connect(), and internal negotiation methods (e.g., _SOCKS5_request, _negotiate_HTTP). Data flows to network sockets during connect, send, receive, and negotiation steps, with no evidence of data being sent to untrusted or malicious external servers outside standard proxy behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets detected. The code uses standard modules and typical proxy negotiation protocols. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables observed. Proxy error codes and exception handling appear standard. The code dynamically replaces socket methods for Python 2 compatibility, which is standard practice. No unusual or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard SOCKS proxy client with support for SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies, including handling authentication, address resolution modes, and connection negotiation protocols. All operations are typical for proxy client implementations, including network connection handling, error reporting, and socket method overrides for compatibility. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system command execution, or network scanning. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The error handling and security measures follow expected standards, and the overall structure aligns with legitimate proxy client design.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs standard network proxy functions, and all operations are consistent with normal proxy connection workflows. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code's security risk is minimal and does not pose an immediate threat.",
