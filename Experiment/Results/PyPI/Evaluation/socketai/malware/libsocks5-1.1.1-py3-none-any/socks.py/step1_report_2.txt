{
  "purpose": "This code implements a SOCKS proxy client library, allowing Python programs to connect through various proxy types (SOCKS4, SOCKS5, HTTP) for network communication, including connection setup and negotiation with proxies.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data such as proxy type, address, port, username, and password from function arguments and class attributes. It also reads data from network sockets during proxy negotiation and connection processes.",
  "sinks": "The code writes proxy negotiation commands and authentication data to network sockets, and executes connection requests. It also encodes credentials in base64 for HTTP proxy authentication. Potential data leaks could occur if sensitive credentials are misused or exposed.",
  "flows": "Input data such as proxy settings and destination addresses flow from function parameters into socket negotiation and connection routines. User credentials are encoded and sent during proxy authentication. Network data flows from the client to the proxy server during connection setup and from the proxy to the destination host. The code reads server responses to confirm connection success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code correctly encodes credentials and uses standard proxy negotiation procedures. The code performs address resolution either locally or remotely based on configuration, with no suspicious address handling. There are no suspicious or malicious code constructs, obfuscated patterns, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard, well-structured SOCKS proxy client with support for SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies. It handles proxy negotiation, authentication, connection setup, and data transfer through proxies. All credential handling is properly encoded; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The flow from input parameters to network communication follows typical patterns for such libraries. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on standard socket operations and proxy protocols without suspicious extensions or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a SOCKS proxy client library, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It securely handles credentials, performs proper protocol negotiations, and adheres to standard network practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior was identified.",
