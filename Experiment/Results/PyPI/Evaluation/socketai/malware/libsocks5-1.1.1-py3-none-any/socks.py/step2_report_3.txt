  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard SOCKS proxy client, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors. It emphasizes proper handling of credentials, protocols, and error management.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is indeed a standard implementation of a SOCKS proxy client supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP, with proper protocol handling. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's characteristics. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable given that the code handles credentials but does not contain secrets or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard proxy negotiation, credential encoding, and no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic is consistent with a legitimate SOCKS proxy client library. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes a legitimate proxy socket implementation with standard procedures and no malicious features.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with a standard SOCKS proxy client. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** The evaluation appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a proxy client with standard features, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical SOCKS proxy client library. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a standard SOCKS proxy client, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with a legitimate proxy client. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code snippets and reports do not indicate any embedded malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code is a standard implementation of a SOCKS proxy client supporting multiple protocols, with proper error handling and credential management.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or hidden code patterns are present.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Given the code's purpose and implementation, the risk is minimal. The scores of 0.1–0.2 are appropriate.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign malware=0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** The scores align with the code's nature—it's a legitimate proxy client library with standard features and no malicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — Low, given the code's purpose and safe handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The code is a standard, legitimate SOCKS proxy client implementation supporting SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies. It handles negotiation, authentication, and connection setup properly. No malicious, backdoor, or obfuscated patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's characteristics.**\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard proxy client behavior)\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis or specific concerns are needed.",
