{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom urllib2 handler to route HTTP and HTTPS requests through a SOCKS proxy, specifically SOCKS5, allowing tunneling of network connections.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from sys.argv (proxy port), and URL requests via opener.open().",
  "sinks": "Network socket connections established in socks.create_connection, data fetched from URLs via opener.open().",
  "flows": "Proxy settings from command line → create connection through socks.create_connection → fetch URL data via open() methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no unusual variable usage. The code relies on standard libraries and a well-known third-party socks library, with no hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a SOCKS proxy handler for urllib2, allowing network requests to be routed through a SOCKS proxy server (default localhost:9050). It includes functions to merge dictionaries and check IP validity, and defines custom connection classes for HTTP and HTTPS that use the socks library to establish connections. The main block parses a port number from command line arguments, constructs an opener with the custom handler, and fetches IP information from httpbin.org. No code indicates data leakage, secret theft, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be a utility for anonymized web requests via a SOCKS proxy without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a SOCKS proxy handler for urllib2, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It facilitates anonymized network requests and does not contain any suspicious or malicious features.",
