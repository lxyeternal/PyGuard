  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SOCKS proxy handler for Python's urllib2, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Its primary purpose is to enable routing traffic through a SOCKS proxy, which is a common and legitimate use case. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The existing reports' scores are accurate and justified."
