  "conclusion": "The code embeds a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally during package setup. The behavior aligns with common malware tactics such as stealthy execution and external content download. The high scores across reports are appropriate, reflecting a significant security threat. Further decoding of the payload is recommended for confirmation, but current evidence warrants treating this as malicious activity."
