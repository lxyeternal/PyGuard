  "purpose": "Detects potential malicious activity through execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup, indicating possible supply chain sabotage or backdoor installation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; subprocess call executing encoded PowerShell command with hidden window and error suppression.",
  "sinks": "Execution of encoded PowerShell command via subprocess, potentially running malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check → subprocess call with encoded command → execution of hidden, obfuscated payload during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded PowerShell command with -EncodedCommand flag, run with hidden window, errors suppressed silently, indicating obfuscation and concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a filesystem check for 'tahg', then conditionally executes a base64-encoded PowerShell command in a hidden window, suppressing errors. The pattern of executing obfuscated commands during setup is a common tactic in malicious supply chain attacks. The obfuscation (base64 encoding) and hidden execution suggest malicious intent, such as backdoors or payload delivery. The suppression of errors further conceals potential failures or malicious actions. The package setup appears legitimate, but embedded malicious behavior is highly suspicious. Scores reflect high suspicion: malware ~0.8, obfuscation ~0.9, security risk ~0.8.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity due to execution of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell commands during setup. While direct payload analysis is needed for confirmation, the pattern aligns with common malicious tactics. It warrants caution and further investigation.",
