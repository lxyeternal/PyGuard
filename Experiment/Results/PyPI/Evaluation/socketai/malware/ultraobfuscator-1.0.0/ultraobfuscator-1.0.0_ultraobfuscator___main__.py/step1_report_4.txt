  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific function, but without the actual code provided, the exact intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources may include user inputs, environment variables, or data from external modules or files. However, the code content is not provided for precise identification.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system calls that could lead to data exfiltration or system modification. Specific sinks cannot be identified without code details.",
  "flows": "The flow would typically involve reading data from sources and passing it into sinks, possibly via intermediate processing. No specific flows can be identified without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to lack of code content. Potential concerns include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls if present.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis as no code is provided. Normally, this step involves examining source locations, sinks, data flows, and checking for suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code provided for analysis. Cannot determine malicious intent or security risks without the actual code fragment.",
