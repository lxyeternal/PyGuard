  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent with their scores. Report 2's signs of obfuscation and potential dynamic code execution justify a slightly higher malware and obfuscation score. The absence of code in other reports supports their low risk and malware scores. Overall, the scores are appropriate and reflect a cautious stance given the evidence."
