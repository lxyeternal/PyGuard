  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, utility functions, or standard library operations without suspicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, standard library modules, or data files read during execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs such as network transmissions, file writes, or system commands that could leak data or cause effects if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs/env vars) to sinks (network, files, system commands) through code execution paths, including dynamic eval/exec if present.",
  "anomalies": "In report 2, signs of obfuscation, use of eval()/exec(), obscure variable naming, and lack of documentation; other reports show no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "Reports 1, 3, 4, 5 lack code or show benign code, justifying low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 indicates potential obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting higher concern. Scores are generally aligned with descriptions. Slightly increasing malware score in report 2 from 0.3 to 0.4 is justified due to the potential risks associated with eval()/exec(). The overall assessment reflects moderate concern primarily centered on report 2's signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with other reports showing minimal or no risk.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent with their scores. Report 2's signs of obfuscation and potential dynamic code execution justify a slightly higher malware and obfuscation score. The absence of code in other reports supports their low risk and malware scores. Overall, the scores are appropriate and reflect a cautious stance given the evidence.",
