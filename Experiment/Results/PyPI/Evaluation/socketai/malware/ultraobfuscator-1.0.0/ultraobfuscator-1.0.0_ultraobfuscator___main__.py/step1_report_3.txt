{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module designed to perform data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, possibly from files or external inputs via function parameters, but specific sources are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but no direct sink is explicitly evident from the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input parameters through processing functions, with no clear untrusted data reaching sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code contains some dynamically executed code segments but uses standard functions. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with functions performing basic operations such as string manipulations, data validation, or simple calculations. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized data access. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious, and there are no signs of code injection or dangerous commands. The lack of comments or documentation makes full intent unclear, but nothing in the structure suggests malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no evident security risks or suspicious anomalies. However, due to limited context, this assessment has a high confidence but cannot guarantee safety if the code interacts with external systems not shown here.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
