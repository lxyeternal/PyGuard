{
  "purpose": "Dynamically executes code constructed from a list of character codes, which decodes into a script that appears to set up a reverse shell connection and execute commands on the host system.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from a list of ASCII character codes used in the exec() function, which is the primary source of untrusted code execution.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded Python code, which includes network requests, system command execution, and possibly malicious operations such as reverse shells.",
  "flows": "The ASCII codes are joined and executed via exec(), leading to network requests (to a GitHub URL), file operations, and system command executions that may send data or establish remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code: the entire payload is represented as a list of ASCII codes, decoded at runtime, which is often used to hide malicious intent. The code constructs a reverse shell connection, performs web requests, and executes system commands. The presence of code to connect to a remote URL and execute commands indicates suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a string from ASCII codes and executes it using exec(). The decoded code defines functions to send data (send_discord_info), and establishes a reverse connection to a GitHub URL (http://github.com/NotInfected/update.git). It retrieves information about the host system, such as username, OS details, and system commands, then attempts to send this data to a remote server. The code also contains logic for executing system commands and potentially downloading and executing further payloads. The obfuscation via ASCII code list and runtime decoding suggests an attempt to evade detection. The functions and network activities align with typical reverse shell or data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to obfuscation and its behavior of establishing a reverse connection, gathering system info, and executing system commands. This pattern is consistent with malware used for remote control or data theft. The use of exec() with decoded code significantly increases risk, and the code's intent appears malicious.",
