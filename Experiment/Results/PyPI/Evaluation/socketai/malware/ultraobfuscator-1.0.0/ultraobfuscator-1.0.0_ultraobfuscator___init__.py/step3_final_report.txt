  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include 'input()', environment variables, network connections, and file reads; sinks include 'exec()', network transmissions, and file modifications.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data passed to 'exec()', network communication to suspicious domains/IPs, data exfiltration points, and hardcoded credentials.",
  "flows": "Sources such as 'input()' or environment variables flow into 'exec()' or network functions, indicating potential malicious control or data leakage pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'exec()' with untrusted input, hardcoded IPs/domains, obfuscation (e.g., complex control flow, encoding), suspicious network activity, and complex control structures.",
  "analysis": "Benign reports (1-3) show standard code with no suspicious patterns, justified by low malware and obfuscation scores (0). Suspicious reports (4-5) demonstrate dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and suspicious network activity, justifying high malware (0.75-0.8), obfuscation (0.7), and risk scores (0.8). The scores are consistent with the described behaviors, with high suspicion in reports 4 and 5 and benign assessments in others.",
  "conclusion": "The scoring accurately reflects the behaviors described. Reports 4 and 5 exhibit high malicious indicators, warranting high malware and risk scores. Reports 1-3 are benign with appropriate low scores. No adjustments needed; the assessments are justified and consistent.",
