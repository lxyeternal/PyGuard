  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling invalid color, style, and control inputs.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, each initializing with a message string and overriding __str__ for display. No input reading, data processing, or external interactions are present. The super().__init__(message) calls are correct, although using super().__init__(message) would be more conventional. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose in exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
