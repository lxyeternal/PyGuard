{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various invalid input cases related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; no input reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or vulnerable operations; no data outputs or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely defines exception classes without executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. The use of 'super(Exception, self)' is unusual but not malicious, possibly intended for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception classes inheriting from 'Exception'. Each class initializes a message attribute and overrides __str__ to return this message. No input/output operations, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be straightforward and purpose-built for exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks, nor any indicators of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is benign and intended for structured error handling in larger applications.",
