  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling invalid colors, styles, and controls in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__ methods) where messages are passed; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with message strings; no complex data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of super(Exception, self).__init__(message) instead of super().__init__(message); minor coding style issue, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no input/output, network activity, or data processing. The only unusual aspect is the super() call style, which is a coding mistake rather than malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and benign, serving as utility classes for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception classes with a minor coding style issue. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, consistent with the analysis.",
