  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes.\n- No input/output, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The only minor coding inconsistency noted is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of the more conventional `super().__init__(message)`. This is not malicious but a coding style issue.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** All are 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently 0 or very low (e.g., 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Are the reported issues present?**\n- The code matches the descriptions: no malicious activity, no vulnerabilities, no obfuscation.\n- The only flaw is the unconventional use of `super(Exception, self)` which is a minor coding mistake, not a security concern.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**\n- Yes, the scores align with the code's nature.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent or security flaw.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors are indicated.\n- The code is purely utility class definitions.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The only minor correction would be to recommend using `super().__init__(message)` for clarity, but this does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering coding style issues)\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's actual content.",
