  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is just class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data input, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n- No issues identified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Notes a minor coding mistake: calling `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of `super().__init__(message)`.\n- Emphasizes that the code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n- The mention of the super() call is a coding error but not malicious.\n- No security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, straightforward exception classes.\n- No external data, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates that the code is simple exception classes.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms straightforward exception class definitions.\n- Corrects that `super().__init__(message)` is more conventional, but the existing code isn't malicious.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that this is purely class definitions for exception handling.\n\n- **Errors or anomalies?**  \n  The only notable point is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` which is unconventional but not malicious. It appears to be a coding mistake rather than an obfuscation or malicious tactic.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  All reports assign malware and risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  Clearly none. The code is straightforward.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the complete lack of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The minor coding mistake in the super() call does not impact security and is not malicious.",
