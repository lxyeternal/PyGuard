  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes.\n- No data input, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The code is straightforward and appears benign.\n- The only noted anomaly is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of the more conventional `super().__init__(message)`. This is likely a coding mistake, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**\n   - No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n   - No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws:**\n   - The only flaw is the incorrect use of `super(Exception, self)` which is not malicious but a coding mistake. This does not impact security but indicates a minor error.\n\n3. **Scores justification:**\n   - Malware score: 0 across all reports is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n   - Security risk score: 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - Risk score: all reports give 0 or 0.9/1 with justifications; since no real issues exist, 0 is appropriate.\n\n4. **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities, noting the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, benign set of custom exception class definitions with a minor coding mistake that does not impact security. The reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at **0**.\n- The risk score should be **0**.\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and the analysis provided.",
