  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes, with no data input/output, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code snippets are straightforward class definitions, with minor variations in super() calls.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent is present in any report.\n- The only noted anomaly is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of `super().__init__(message)`, which is a coding style issue, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose is solely to define exception classes, which is benign.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- Minor coding mistake: `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` should be `super().__init__(message)` for clarity and correctness, but this is not malicious.\n- No other issues are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, this seems appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no data processing, network activity, or hidden behavior, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- The only potential concern is the super() call style, but this is a coding style issue, not a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign utility module for exception handling, with no malicious or security concerns. The minor super() call style issue does not impact security.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
