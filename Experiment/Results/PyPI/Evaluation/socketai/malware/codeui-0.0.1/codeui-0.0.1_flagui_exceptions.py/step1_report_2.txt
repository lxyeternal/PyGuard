  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling invalid input related to colors, styles, and controls.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading mechanisms are present in this code.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method calls super(Exception, self).__init__(message) instead of super().__init__(message), which is incorrect but not malicious; this appears to be a coding mistake rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, each with a constructor setting a message attribute and a __str__ method to return it. There are no input reading, data processing, network operations, or any suspicious behavior. The unusual super() call is likely a coding error rather than an attempt to hide malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as exception class definitions with a minor coding error. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
