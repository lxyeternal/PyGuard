  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling invalid color, style, and control inputs.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class. Each class initializes with a message string and overrides __str__ to return the message. There are no data inputs, network operations, or data processing routines. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module for exception handling.",
