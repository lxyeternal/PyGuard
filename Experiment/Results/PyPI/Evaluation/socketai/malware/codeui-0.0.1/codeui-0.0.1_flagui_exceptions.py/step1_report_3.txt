  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling invalid color, hex color, style, and control errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; only class definitions and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. The exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines custom exception classes with no external input handling, no data processing, no network operations, and no dynamic execution. The structure is simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It appears to be a utility module for error handling within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely defining custom exceptions for input validation or error reporting. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
