  "purpose": "A utility function 'cprint' that outputs styled, colored text to the terminal, allowing customization of foreground and background colors, styles, and line colors.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'text', 'fore_256', 'back_256', 'fore_rgb', 'back_rgb', 'formatting', 'line_color'; imported modules '.colored', 'foreground_rgb', 'background_rgb'.",
  "sinks": "The built-in 'print()' function, which outputs to standard output (terminal).",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence style variables; these are combined into style strings and passed to 'print()' for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or external data exfiltration; reliance on external styling modules presumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward styled print utility. It constructs style strings based on input parameters, utilizing external modules for color formatting. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is clear, with no suspicious data flows or external communications. The styling functions are standard for terminal output customization. The code's simplicity and reliance on presumed safe external modules indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for printing styled, colored text in the terminal. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
