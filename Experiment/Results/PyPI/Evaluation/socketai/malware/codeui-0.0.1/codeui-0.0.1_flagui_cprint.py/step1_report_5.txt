{
  "purpose": "Provides a customized print function with colored and styled text output, wrapping around the built-in print() function.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.colored', function arguments for text and color/style parameters.",
  "sinks": "The print() function outputs to standard output; no untrusted data flows into external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "flows": "Input parameters for colors and styles are processed to generate styling codes, which are then concatenated with the text and sent to print().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for styled printing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function cprint() that formats text with color and style attributes, utilizing helper functions and classes from a local module. No external data inputs or outputs beyond standard print(). No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file operations are present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a colored print utility, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
