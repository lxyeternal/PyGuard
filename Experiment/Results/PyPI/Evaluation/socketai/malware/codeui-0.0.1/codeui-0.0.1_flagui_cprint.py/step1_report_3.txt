{
  "purpose": "This code provides a customized print function 'cprint' that outputs colored and styled text to the terminal, leveraging external color formatting utilities.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily the 'text' argument and optional color/style parameters provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 'print' function, which outputs styled text to the terminal. No data is sent elsewhere or over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> formatting logic -> constructed string with styles -> print to terminal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code relies on external modules for coloring but does not include malicious code or obfuscated constructs. No malicious data leaks or network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The function defines a stylized print mechanism, accepting various color and style parameters. It processes these parameters, calls external functions for color formatting, and then outputs styled text. The code appears to be a straightforward utility without malicious intent or obfuscation. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious payloads. The import statements and function logic are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a stylized print utility for terminal output, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended solely for aesthetic terminal output formatting.",
