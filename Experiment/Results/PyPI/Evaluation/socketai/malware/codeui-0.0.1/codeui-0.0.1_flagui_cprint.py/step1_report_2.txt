{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom print function 'cprint' that outputs colored and styled text to the terminal.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the function argument 'text' and optional color/style parameters. It also imports from local modules (.colored).",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the print statement which outputs to the console. No untrusted data is written to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (text, colors, styles) flow into the formatting logic, then to the print statement which outputs the styled text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard Python functions and external styling modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function for colored terminal output. It imports styling functions and uses input parameters to determine the style. No dynamic code execution, network access, or malicious operations are present. The imports are local modules, presumed safe. The function performs straightforward string formatting and printing, with no evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a harmless utility for styled terminal output with no malicious intent. It does not perform any network operations, data theft, or harmful modifications.",
