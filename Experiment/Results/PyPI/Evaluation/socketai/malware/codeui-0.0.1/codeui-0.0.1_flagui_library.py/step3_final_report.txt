{
  "purpose": "Defines a static class with constants, dictionaries, and mappings related to terminal styling, colors, and control sequences for use in terminal output formatting.",
  "sources": "Static definitions within the class, including escape sequences, color mappings, control sequences, and environment variable values.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data, nor does it write to files, network, or execute commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow or dynamic processing; all data are static constants used for styling terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is purely static with extensive predefined constants and mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dataclass containing terminal styling constants, color codes, control sequences, and environment variable mappings. It does not perform any input/output, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The large static data sets are typical for terminal styling utilities and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for terminal styling with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All signals and reports correctly identify it as safe. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.",
