{
  "purpose": "Define a data class containing ANSI escape sequences, color codes, and terminal control sequences for terminal styling and coloring.",
  "sources": "Class attributes for escape sequences, environment variable descriptions, static dictionaries for color mappings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; code is mainly static data definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; static data only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured collection of constants and mappings related to terminal colors and control sequences. All data appears static and intended for styling terminal output. There are no functions executing external commands, network operations, or data handling that could pose security risks. The dictionaries are extensive but static mappings, with no processing of external inputs or potentially malicious behaviors. The environment variable reference is only in a comment/documentation context, not actively used in code logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of constants for terminal styling with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to serve as a utility module for terminal color and style management, with no active or dynamic components that could be malicious.",
