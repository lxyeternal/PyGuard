{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class containing constants for terminal color codes, control sequences, and color mappings for terminal styling and display purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data are hardcoded constants within class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or functions that process untrusted input data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; all data are static definitions used for formatting terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of static data definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'dataclass' and defines a class 'Library' with multiple class variables containing terminal color codes, control sequences, style codes, environment variable mappings, and color mappings in decimal and hex formats. There are no functions, dynamic executions, or data processing logic. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard set of constants for terminal styling and color management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of constants for terminal color and control sequence definitions, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is purely static data intended for formatting terminal output.",
