  "purpose": "Define a class containing color and control sequence constants for terminal styling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data are class attributes with static mappings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class attributes are static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward static data definitions with no dynamic or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a dataclass 'Library' containing numerous string constants, dictionaries, and mappings for terminal color sequences, control sequences, environment variable values, and color codes. There are no input processing, data manipulation, or I/O operations. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity is evident. The structure and content are static, well-organized constants for styling purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static collection of constants for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears purely informational and utility-focused.",
