{
  "purpose": "Defines a dataclass 'Library' containing constants and mappings related to terminal color codes, control sequences, and environment variable values for terminal styling.",
  "sources": "Constants and dictionaries within the class, no external data inputs or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs handling untrusted input; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations beyond static definitions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines static mappings and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or external data processing present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of a dataclass with class variables and dictionaries defining color codes, control sequences, and environment variable values. No input handling, no I/O operations, no dynamic evaluation, or network activity. The data is static and intended for styling terminal output. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides static constants and mappings for terminal styling purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility class for terminal color and control sequence management.",
