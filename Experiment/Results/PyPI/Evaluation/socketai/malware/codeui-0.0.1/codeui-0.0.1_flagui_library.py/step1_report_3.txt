{
  "purpose": "Defines a class containing constants and mappings for terminal color and control sequences.",
  "sources": "Class attributes and static dictionaries; no external input sources or data reads.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static definitions for terminal control sequences, color codes, and mappings. It uses dataclass for organizing constants. No input/output operations, network activity, or code execution features are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable manipulations, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and intended for terminal color and control sequence management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a collection of static constants for terminal color sequences and control codes with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
