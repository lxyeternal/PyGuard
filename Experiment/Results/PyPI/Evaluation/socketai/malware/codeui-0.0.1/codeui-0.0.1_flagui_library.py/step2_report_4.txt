  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a `dataclass` named `Library` that contains static constants, dictionaries, and mappings related to terminal styling, including ANSI escape sequences, color codes, control sequences, environment variable values, and color mappings.\n- The code is purely static, with no input/output, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- No secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Static constants for terminal styling.\n- Analysis: No external data, no I/O, no dynamic behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, utility module.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define a data class with ANSI sequences and color mappings.\n- Analysis: Static data, no external input or dynamic code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Constants for terminal sequences.\n- Analysis: Static definitions, no I/O or external data handling.\n- Conclusion: Safe, static constants.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Color and control sequences.\n- Analysis: Static data, no dynamic or external code.\n- Conclusion: Benign static data.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Color and control sequence constants.\n- Analysis: Static, no I/O, no dynamic behavior.\n- Conclusion: Purely informational.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is static, well-structured, and contains no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- The malware score across all reports is 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The security risk score is also 0, indicating no identified vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a static collection of constants and mappings for terminal styling. There are no dynamic elements, no external data processing, and no obfuscation or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. Based on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores and assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis code is benign and purely utility-oriented, with no security risks.",
