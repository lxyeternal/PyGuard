  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, contains only constants and mappings related to terminal styling.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code appears to be a utility module for terminal color and control sequences.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static and benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The analysis is consistent and accurate; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`, which is justified.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores and conclusions are consistent with the code's static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' conclusions and scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a static collection of constants and mappings for terminal styling. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data processing, or code that could be exploited. The environment variable reference is only in documentation/comments, not in active code. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code is benign and poses no security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo action needed; the code is safe.",
