  "malware": 0.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "purpose": "Terminal styling library managing ANSI color codes, environment variable controls, and Windows terminal mode enabling.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('FORCE_COLOR', 'NO_COLOR'), platform detection, system API calls for Windows console mode, class attributes for style and color codes.",
  "sinks": "Generation of ANSI escape sequences for styling; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and platform checks influence ANSI code generation; system API calls modify console modes; styling functions produce escape sequences based on internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; standard use of system APIs and environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward terminal styling utility that manages color and style output with platform-aware features. It uses environment variables to control color support, enables Windows virtual terminal processing via system API calls, and generates ANSI escape sequences for styling. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. The environment variable checks and system calls are standard for such utilities, and the code structure is clear and well-organized.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard terminal styling library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low security risk score and zero malware score are justified. It responsibly handles environment variables and platform-specific configurations without introducing security vulnerabilities.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
