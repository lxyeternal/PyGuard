{
  "purpose": "Provides functions and classes for terminal text styling, including color and style codes, with support for Windows terminals and environment variable overrides.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (FORCE_COLOR, NO_COLOR), system platform information, and terminal stream properties (sys.stdout/stderr).",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables and terminal properties to determine whether to enable styling; no data sinks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and TTY checks influence enabling/disabling of styles; terminal mode configuration flows from system calls; style attributes flow from input parameters to formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; code uses system calls safely; no obfuscated or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements terminal styling functions with environment variable overrides and platform-specific adjustments for Windows. It includes safe system calls for Windows terminal mode configuration, environment variable checks for user override, and TTY detection for style application. No external data transmission, hidden code, or suspicious logic is observed. It adheres to standard practices for terminal styling and environment-aware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate terminal styling utility functions with environment-aware controls and platform-specific adjustments. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, and it primarily manipulates ANSI escape codes based on environment and system properties.",
