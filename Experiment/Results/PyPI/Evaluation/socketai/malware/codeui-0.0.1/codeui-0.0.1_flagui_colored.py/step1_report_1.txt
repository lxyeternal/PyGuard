{
  "purpose": "Provides color styling and formatting utilities for terminal output, including support for Windows terminal modes and environment-based color support control.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'FORCE_COLOR', 'NO_COLOR'), checks terminal capabilities via sys.stdout/stderr, reads system platform info, imports local modules for color/utility data.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables, system API calls for terminal mode configuration, and string formatting for ANSI escape sequences.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence 'enabled()' which affects whether color codes are output. 'enable_windows_terminal_mode()' adjusts console modes on Windows. Color and style functions generate ANSI sequences based on inputs, environment, and terminal capabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or system modifications detected. Usage of system calls and environment variables is standard for terminal styling libraries. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles terminal styling with support for Windows. It conditionally enables VT processing, checks environment variables for color support, and generates ANSI escape sequences for styling. The use of system APIs and environment variables aligns with standard terminal utility functions. No suspicious data handling or malicious behavior is present. The code structure is straightforward, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as a terminal styling library with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It carefully manages environment conditions and system capabilities for safe operation. No security threats or malware indications are found.",
