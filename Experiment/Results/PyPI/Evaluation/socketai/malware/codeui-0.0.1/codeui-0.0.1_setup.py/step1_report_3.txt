  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data outputs observed",
  "flows": "N/A, typical setup process with no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; uses standard packaging functions",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools functions, defines setup parameters such as name, version, packages, dependencies, author, and description. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The only dependency specified is 'requests==2.31.0', which is a common library. The script appears to be a typical setup configuration for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a benign package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
