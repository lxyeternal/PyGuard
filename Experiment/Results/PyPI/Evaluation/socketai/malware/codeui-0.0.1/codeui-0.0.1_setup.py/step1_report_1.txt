  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'codeui' including its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Module imports (setuptools), package metadata fields (name, version, author, description), dependencies list (requests==2.31.0).",
  "sinks": "N/A — no untrusted data handling, network activity, or external inputs are processed within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A — static setup configuration with no runtime data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward package setup with no suspicious code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library to facilitate package setup. It defines package metadata including name, version, author, and description. It specifies a fixed dependency on 'requests==2.31.0'. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no code execution, or external data handling present. The code is typical for Python package distribution and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies, which are common and benign.",
