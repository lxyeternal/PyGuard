  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution of the 'codeui' Python package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, find_packages() for package discovery, install_requires for dependency specification.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or untrusted data output functions are present.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration reads package files and dependencies, but no user input or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies, including fixed version requirements. There are no dynamic code executions, no reading of external input, and no security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply specifies package information and dependencies.",
