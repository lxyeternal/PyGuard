  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call: name, version, packages, install_requires, author, description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communication; no code execution or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools for packaging. It specifies package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner. No user input or external data is processed at runtime, and there are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware. The dependencies are fixed and explicitly declared, and the code contains no network or system modification commands.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a typical, safe packaging script.",
