{
  "purpose": "This script is used to configure and install a Python package named 'codeui' with its dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the script itself, specifically the package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input data; no network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration reads static package info and dependencies; there are no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The dependency version is fixed, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies package info and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or suspicious logic is included. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The dependency version is explicitly pinned, which is typical for reproducibility, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
