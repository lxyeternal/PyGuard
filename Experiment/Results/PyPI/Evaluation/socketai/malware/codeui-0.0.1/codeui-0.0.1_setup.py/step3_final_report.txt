  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, static package metadata, fixed dependency list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or code execution.",
  "flows": "None; static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that defines package metadata and dependencies without any dynamic or suspicious elements. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute code beyond static function calls. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The dependency is explicitly pinned, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with best practices for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and straightforward configuration.",
