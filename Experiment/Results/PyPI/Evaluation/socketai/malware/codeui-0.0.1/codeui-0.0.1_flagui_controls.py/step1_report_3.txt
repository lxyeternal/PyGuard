{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class to control cursor movements using ANSI escape codes, primarily for terminal manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments 'name', 'row', and optional 'column'. It also accesses constants from the imported 'Library' module.",
  "sinks": "The return statements generate ANSI escape sequences. No untrusted data is directly written to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input arguments ('name', 'row', 'column') are validated, then used to generate escape sequences based on internal control mappings. No external data flow to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The control flow is straightforward. Usage of internal constants from 'Library' appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes utilities and control mappings from imported modules. The 'nav' method validates input types and existence of control names, then constructs ANSI escape sequences accordingly. No external data is processed or transmitted. The method raises exceptions for invalid inputs but does not perform any suspicious actions such as network calls, file operations, or data leaks. The code adheres to typical terminal control logic and does not contain hidden backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs terminal cursor control functions using ANSI escape codes. It includes input validation and control checks but no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be standard application code with no security concerns.",
