{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class Controls that manages cursor movement commands using ANSI escape codes, with validation and control existence checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the nav method ('name', 'row', 'column'), reading from class attributes and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating escape sequences, usage of external class Utilities and Library, which do not perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated via _is_str_object and utils.is_control_exist, then used to generate escape sequences based on control type and position.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code relies on external libraries for control validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs input validation and constructs escape sequences for cursor movements. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications are present. The validation functions and return statements are straightforward and do not process untrusted data in a harmful way. Usage of external modules suggests proper validation and control existence checks, assuming these modules are benign. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for generating ANSI cursor control sequences with proper validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, utility-like component.",
