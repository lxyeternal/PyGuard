  "purpose": "Terminal color formatting utility using ANSI escape codes with dynamic attribute handling.",
  "sources": "External modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attributes, methods rgb() and RGB().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are used or affected.",
  "flows": "Initialization of color variables from Library.COLORS, method calls rgb() and RGB() generating escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "Use of vars() for dynamic variable creation and __getattr__ override; unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a terminal color utility with dynamic attribute creation, a metaclass to handle invalid color attributes, and RGB formatting functions. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The use of vars() and __getattr__ is standard for such utilities and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. External modules are assumed safe. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard terminal color utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing low risk and malware scores are appropriate; the obfuscated score is correctly zero. Slightly increasing the risk score to 0.2 reflects the unconventional techniques but does not imply danger.",
