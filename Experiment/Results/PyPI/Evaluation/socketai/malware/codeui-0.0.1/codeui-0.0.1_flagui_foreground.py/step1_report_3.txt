{
  "purpose": "Defines a color formatting utility with dynamic attribute handling and RGB color support for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .library, .utilities, .exceptions; class attributes; method parameters.",
  "sinks": "String formatting in rgb() and RGB() methods, potential output to terminal or logs.",
  "flows": "Method inputs (r, g, b) flow through is_percentage() utility, then used in string formatting to generate color codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of dynamic vars() is standard here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for terminal color formatting, with dynamic attribute access and RGB support. The MetaFore class customizes attribute access to raise exceptions for invalid colors. The Fore class initializes color codes from a library and provides methods for RGB color formatting. No external data input, network calls, or file I/O detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All functions and class structures align with typical terminal color utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign color formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages color code generation for terminal output, with no suspicious behaviors detected.",
