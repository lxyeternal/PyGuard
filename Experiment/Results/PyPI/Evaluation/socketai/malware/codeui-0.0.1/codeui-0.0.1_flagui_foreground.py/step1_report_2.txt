{
  "purpose": "Defines color formatting classes for terminal output, including dynamic color attribute handling and RGB color code generation.",
  "sources": "Imports from .library, .utilities, and .exceptions modules; class attribute definitions; method parameters for RGB values.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or outputs untrusted data; primarily generates color codes based on internal constants and method inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters for RGB are processed through Utilities.is_percentage, then formatted into color codes; no external data flows directly to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ override to raise exceptions for invalid color attributes; dynamic attribute creation from a constants dictionary is typical; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for terminal color formatting with dynamic attribute handling. The MetaFore class customizes attribute access to throw exceptions for invalid colors, ensuring controlled access. The Fore class initializes color code variables from a Library module and provides methods to generate RGB color strings, utilizing a utility function for validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of dynamic variable creation and method delegation appears standard for such utility classes. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard terminal color formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious actions or contain malware. The overall security risk is low.",
