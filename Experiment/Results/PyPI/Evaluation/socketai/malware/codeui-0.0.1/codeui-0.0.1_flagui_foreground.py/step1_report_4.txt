{
  "purpose": "Defines color formatting classes for terminal output, with dynamic attribute handling and RGB color generation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the same package, accesses constants from Library, and reads class attributes and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses class variables and methods to generate ANSI escape sequences for colors; no external untrusted input used in critical functions.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; method parameters are assumed trusted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The dynamic attribute error handling via __getattr__ is standard for such classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass and a class for color formatting using ANSI escape sequences. It dynamically creates color variables from a Library. The rgb and RGB methods generate RGB escape sequences, with input validation via Utilities. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscation or unusual code structures are present. The dynamic __getattr__ override raises an exception for invalid colors, which is benign and intended for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of terminal color formatting with no malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external constants and utility functions assumed safe. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
