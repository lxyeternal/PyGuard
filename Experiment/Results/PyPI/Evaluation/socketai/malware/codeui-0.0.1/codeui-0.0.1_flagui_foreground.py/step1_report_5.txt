{
  "purpose": "Defines a color formatting utility class with dynamic color attributes and RGB color methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions); accesses class variables and constants.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits untrusted data; no external input or output handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static attribute definitions and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ in MetaFore; no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for terminal color formatting with dynamic attribute creation. The MetaFore metaclass customizes attribute access to raise exceptions for undefined colors, which is a safeguard rather than malicious behavior. The Fore class initializes color codes from a Library module and provides methods for RGB color formatting. There are no signs of malicious activity, external data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard utility module with safeguards for invalid attribute access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward color utility class with a custom attribute access safeguard. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It appears safe and intended for formatting terminal output.",
