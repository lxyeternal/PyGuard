  "purpose": "Utility class providing color, style, and control validation and conversion functions for terminal styling.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.getenv('COLORTERM')) and input parameters such as color names, styles, and control names.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions for invalid color, style, or control; sets environment variable 'COLORTERM'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation functions -> potential exception raising or environment variable setting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or obfuscated code; environment variable is read and set but in a controlled manner.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of color, style, and control inputs against predefined dictionaries, raising exceptions if invalid. It converts percentage strings to numeric values, adjusts environment variables, and checks input types. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code operates within a safe scope, focusing solely on terminal styling validation and conversion. The only potential concern is environment variable manipulation, but it is used in a typical manner for terminal configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for styling validation and environment configuration. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
