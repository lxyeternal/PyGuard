  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling colors, styles, controls, and environment settings in a terminal-related library.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), input parameters to methods (e.g., colorterm, name, percent, numbers).",
  "sinks": "Environment variable setting (os.environ['COLORTERM']), potential data return values from convert_percentages, exception raising in validation functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation or conversion functions → environment variable setting or data return → exception raising on invalid data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The convert_percentages method dynamically creates a mapping and handles percentages, but in a safe manner. Use of environment variables is standard for terminal configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides validation and conversion utilities for color and style settings, with proper exception handling for invalid inputs. It accesses environment variables to determine terminal color capabilities, which is common and does not suggest malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. All operations are related to configuration management and validation, with no network activity or system manipulation observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility module for managing terminal color and style configurations. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It relies on standard environment variables and performs validation and conversion tasks safely.",
