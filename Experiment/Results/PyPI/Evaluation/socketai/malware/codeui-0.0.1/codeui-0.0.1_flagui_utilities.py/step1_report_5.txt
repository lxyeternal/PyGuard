  "purpose": "Utility functions for color, style, and control validation and conversion in a terminal styling library.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COLORTERM' (set_colorterm), input parameters for validation functions, class attributes (e.g., self.colorterm).",
  "sinks": "os.environ['COLORTERM'] (modifies environment variables), potential misuse of environment variables.",
  "flows": "set_colorterm() reads environment variable; convert_percentages() uses self.colorterm to determine maximum color value; is_color_exist() and other validation methods check input against internal dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs standard validation and environment variable handling without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions validating colors, styles, and controls, converting percentages to color codes, and managing environment variables. All interactions with external data are limited to validation against internal dictionaries or environment variables. No network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration is present. The environment variable handling is standard. The functions seem designed solely for terminal styling purposes, with proper exception handling. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It performs validation, environment variable management, and percentage conversions securely without any malicious patterns.",
