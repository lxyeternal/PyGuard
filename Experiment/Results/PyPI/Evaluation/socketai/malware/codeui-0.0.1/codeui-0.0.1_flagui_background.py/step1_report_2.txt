{
  "purpose": "Define a class for managing terminal background colors, including predefined colors and RGB capabilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from .library, .utilities, and .exceptions modules; class attributes; class methods.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data flows or output handling that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (r, g, b) flow into rgb() and RGB() methods, which generate color codes based on inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. Use of __getattr__ to raise exceptions for invalid color names is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a color management system with predefined colors from a library and supports RGB color formatting. It uses class inheritance and metaclass overriding to handle attribute access. The rgb() method processes inputs, possibly validating or transforming them via Utilities.is_percentage(). No external data sources or outputs are involved. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured color utility module without malicious intent. No security threats or malware indicators are present.",
