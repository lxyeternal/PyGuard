{
  "purpose": "Provides terminal color utilities with dynamic attribute handling and RGB support, managing color constants and safe error reporting for invalid colors.",
  "sources": "Color constants loaded from internal Library module; attribute access via __getattr__ in MetaBack class.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or file operations; internal variable assignment only.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers __getattr__ which raises exceptions; color constants initialized from Library.COLORS; rgb methods generate escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to raise custom InvalidColor exceptions is standard; dynamic variable creation for colors is typical; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for terminal color management, with controlled attribute access and RGB sequence generation. No external data flows, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The exception handling for invalid colors is a safe, standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for terminal color handling with proper error management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The existing reports' assessments and scores are justified and appropriate.",
