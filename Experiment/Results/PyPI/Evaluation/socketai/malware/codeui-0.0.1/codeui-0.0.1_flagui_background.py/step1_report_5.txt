  "purpose": "Define a class for managing terminal background colors with dynamic attribute access and RGB color support.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, local module imports (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attributes, class methods, and dynamic variable assignment within the class scope.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating color codes, dynamic attribute access raising exceptions, and potential data processing in methods.",
  "flows": "Accessing class attributes or calling methods results in generation of color codes or attribute error exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The dynamic attribute error handling is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for terminal colors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass to override attribute access for the 'Back' class, raising an exception when invalid colors are requested. The 'Back' class initializes color codes from a library and dynamically creates class variables for each color. Methods 'rgb' and 'RGB' generate RGB background color codes with input validation via an imported utility. No untrusted data input, network operations, or malicious behavior is present. The dynamic attribute access error handling is for user-friendly error messages. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malware indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of terminal color handling with safe exception management and no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
