  "purpose": "Define color-related utilities and classes with custom attribute handling for color codes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.library, .utilities, .exceptions), class attribute definitions, methods rgb and RGB.",
  "sinks": "Potential data formatting in rgb and RGB methods, dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ in MetaBack.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources; data flows are internal formatting and attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to raise custom exceptions for invalid color attributes; dynamic variable assignment for color codes; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling color codes with custom attribute access and color formatting methods. The MetaBack class overrides __getattr__ to raise an exception for invalid color attributes, which is a standard way to handle attribute errors intentionally. The Back class initializes color constants from a library and provides methods to generate RGB color strings, which perform internal validation and formatting. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a well-structured utility module for color management, with no suspicious or malicious code. No external input handling or network operations are present that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a utility module for color handling with safe attribute management and color code formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only notable feature is the custom attribute error handling, which is standard practice. Overall, it appears safe.",
