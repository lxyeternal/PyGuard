  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; standard setup functions.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md content into 'long_description' before passing it to 'setup'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard usage of setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a README.md file for long description, and calls 'setup' with package info and dependencies. The dependencies list is empty, which is normal. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It appears to be safe.",
