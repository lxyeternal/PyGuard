  "purpose": "Standard Python packaging script that reads a README.md file for long description and calls setup() with static metadata.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or effects",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README.md file and uses setuptools.setup() with static parameters. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external input processing. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of suspicious or malicious elements. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. No further action is necessary.",
