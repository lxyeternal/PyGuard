  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; standard setup.py pattern. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the README.md file for the long description, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No external input or untrusted data is processed beyond the file read, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, malicious commands, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
