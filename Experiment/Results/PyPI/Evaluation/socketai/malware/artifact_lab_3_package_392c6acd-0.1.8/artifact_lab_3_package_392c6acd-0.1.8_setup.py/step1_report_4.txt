  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package, including package discovery and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file to get long description content.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into 'long_description' variable used in setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard setup tools.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads a README.md file to include as long description, and calls 'setup' with package metadata. No suspicious or unusual code structures, no hidden dynamic execution, and no data leaks or malicious actions identified. The dependencies list is empty, which is normal for a minimal setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
