  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' and passes static package configuration data to setuptools setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures. It reads a local README.md file to include as a long description, then calls setup() with static values for package metadata. All data sources and flows are local and static; no external inputs, untrusted data, or malicious code are present. No insecure or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
