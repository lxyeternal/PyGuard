  "purpose": "Establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server for remote command execution.",
  "sources": "Host and port variables, socket connection, subprocess call executing bash command.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection for data transmission, subprocess executing shell command.",
  "flows": "Connects to remote host -> redirects stdin/stdout/stderr to socket -> executes bash reverse shell command.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and port, use of reverse shell code, direct execution of shell command with network connection, no input validation, potential persistence or backdoor behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a TCP socket connection to a specific remote server (ngrok URL). It then redirects standard input, output, and error streams to this socket, effectively linking the remote server to the system's shell. Finally, it executes a bash reverse shell command via subprocess, establishing a persistent reverse shell connection back to the remote server. The hardcoded IP and port, combined with the reverse shell functionality, strongly suggest malicious intent as it allows remote control of the compromised system. No input from users is processed; all actions are predefined, indicating malicious behavior rather than benign debugging or maintenance.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a malicious reverse shell backdoor, enabling remote control over the system. It employs hardcoded network details and executes a bash command to establish persistent access, representing a significant security risk. The code should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
