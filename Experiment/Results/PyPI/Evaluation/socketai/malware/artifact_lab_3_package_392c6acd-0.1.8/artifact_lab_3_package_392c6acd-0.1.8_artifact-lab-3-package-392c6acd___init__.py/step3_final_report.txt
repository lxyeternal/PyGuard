  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from the local main module, importing a function named 'reverse_shell'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the __init__.py file, importing 'reverse_shell' from .main.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow; import is static and does not invoke or execute the function.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a function named 'reverse_shell' which is commonly associated with malicious activities, but no malicious code or invocation is present here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no active logic. The function name 'reverse_shell' suggests potential malicious intent if invoked, but the snippet itself does not execute or misuse it. The scores assigned in the reports reflect suspicion based solely on the name, but without evidence of malicious behavior or code execution, the actual risk and malware scores should be very low. Obfuscation is correctly scored as zero. The concern is purely theoretical and depends on how 'reverse_shell' is used elsewhere. Given the absence of active malicious code, the malware score should be 0, and the risk score should be minimal, around 0.2.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only performs a static import. The suspicion related to 'reverse_shell' is valid but speculative without further context. The scores should be adjusted downward, with malware set to 0 and risk kept low, reflecting the lack of active malicious behavior in this snippet.",
