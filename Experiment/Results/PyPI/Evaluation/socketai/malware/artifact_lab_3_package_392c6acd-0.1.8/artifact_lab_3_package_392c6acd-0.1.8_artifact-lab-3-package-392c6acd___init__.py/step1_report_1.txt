  "purpose": "Importing the 'reverse_shell' function or object from the 'main' module, likely to be used elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.main' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Potential concern due to importing 'reverse_shell', which may be used for creating reverse shells, a common malicious tool. The actual code of 'reverse_shell' is not shown, so this could be benign or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module. The presence of 'reverse_shell' suggests the module may be related to network connections or remote command execution. Without further context, this import could be benign or malicious, but it warrants caution due to the name's potential association with malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and does not contain malicious behavior directly. However, the imported 'reverse_shell' indicates possible security risks depending on its implementation. Further investigation into the 'main' module and the 'reverse_shell' function is recommended.",
