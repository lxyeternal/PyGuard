  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing AWS SDK boto3 sessions and logging configuration.",
  "sources": "Functions that set up default sessions and configure logging handlers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; only internal SDK calls and logging setup.",
  "flows": "Function calls from user code to boto3 session methods and logging configuration, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard usage.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard AWS SDK session management and logging setup functions. It uses common patterns, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The logging configuration warns about potential sensitive data exposure but does not log sensitive data itself. No obfuscation or external network activity is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical SDK utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for AWS SDK session and logging management. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects standard logging warnings but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
