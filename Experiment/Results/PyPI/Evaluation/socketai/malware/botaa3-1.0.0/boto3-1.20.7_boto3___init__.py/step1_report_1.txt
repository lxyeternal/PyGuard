{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of utility functions for configuring AWS SDK boto3 sessions and logging, primarily aimed at setting up default sessions and loggers.",
  "sources": "User code calls setup_default_session, set_stream_logger, client, resource functions; these functions read parameters for session configuration and logging levels.",
  "sinks": "Creating boto3 sessions and clients; logging outputs to console or logs; no sensitive data is explicitly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions (session args, logging config) flow into session setup and logger configuration; no untrusted data flows to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. Usage of standard logging, boto3 API calls, and deprecated warning are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes default AWS sessions and logging configurations using boto3, a common AWS SDK. Functions are straightforward wrappers. The logging setup warns about sensitive data exposure but does not log sensitive info itself. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no credential handling within this snippet. The code’s purpose aligns with normal SDK configuration; no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard AWS SDK utility code for session and logging setup. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code's design and content are consistent with legitimate library code. Confidence is high in this assessment.",
