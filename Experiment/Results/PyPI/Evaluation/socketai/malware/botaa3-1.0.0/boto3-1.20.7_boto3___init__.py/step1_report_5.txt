  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for setting up AWS boto3 sessions, logging configuration, and creating AWS service clients and resources.",
  "sources": "Imports boto3 modules, function parameters, global DEFAULT_SESSION variable, logging configuration, and function calls.",
  "sinks": "Calls to boto3.session.Session methods (client, resource), logging handlers, and the use of global session variable.",
  "flows": "setup_default_session() initializes the session; get_default_session() retrieves or creates the session; client() and resource() use the session to create AWS clients/resources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines functions for session management and logging configuration for AWS SDK boto3. It includes setup and retrieval of default AWS sessions, logging setup with adjustable levels, and adding a NullHandler for safe logging. The code follows standard practices and contains no indicators of malicious intent. It does not process untrusted data, access sensitive information, or perform any network activity beyond AWS SDK calls. All elements appear consistent with a legitimate utility library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for AWS boto3 session and logging management. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate AWS SDK usage.",
