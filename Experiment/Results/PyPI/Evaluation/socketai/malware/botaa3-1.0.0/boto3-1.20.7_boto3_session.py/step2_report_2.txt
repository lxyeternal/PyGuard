  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an AWS session manager.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or data leaks are evident; credentials are handled via parameters or environment.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code follows standard SDK patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes no malicious activity, with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK usage, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — the small risk is acceptable given the code's nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the standard structure, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, confirms standard SDK patterns, proper credential handling, and no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: legitimate SDK wrapper, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected.\n- **Behavior:** Standard AWS SDK session management, resource loading, and client creation.\n- **Credential handling:** Uses parameters or environment, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Network activity:** Only AWS API interactions, no suspicious data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No signs of code obfuscation or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 or 0.1, since the code is a typical SDK wrapper with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1 for minimal configuration complexity)\n\nThis analysis confirms the reports' conclusions and scoring are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure the environment where this code runs is secure, as the code itself appears benign.",
