  "purpose": "This code manages AWS sessions, credentials, and resource loading, providing an interface to create clients and resources for AWS services.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key, aws_session_token, profile_name, region_name, and environment variables via botocore session components.",
  "sinks": "Network calls to AWS endpoints through created clients and resources, utilizing credentials and configuration data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables flow into session setup, credential configuration, and resource/model loading, leading to network interactions with AWS services.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code follows standard SDK extension practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical AWS SDK session manager, handling credentials securely via parameters or environment, setting up resource factories, and registering handlers for SDK customization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The credential handling is standard, and there are no signs of data leaks or malicious network activity. The code structure and imports are consistent with legitimate SDK extension code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign AWS SDK session management class with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising features. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
