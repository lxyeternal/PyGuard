{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes and functions to build DynamoDB condition expressions with placeholder substitution, facilitating safe query construction.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include attribute names and values provided to condition objects and methods (e.g., attribute values in eq(), lt(), between(), etc.), and possibly external input when instantiating attribute objects.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the building of condition expressions that incorporate placeholders, which are then intended to be used with DynamoDB API calls. No direct data leaks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input attribute names/values flow into condition objects, which are processed by the ExpressionBuilder to generate expression strings with placeholders, replacing actual values with placeholders for safe query parameterization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code dynamically generates placeholders and expression strings but does so in a controlled manner aligned with DynamoDB best practices. No obfuscated code, malicious network operations, or privacy violations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach for constructing DynamoDB query expressions using placeholders, reducing injection risks. It leverages regular expressions and placeholder templates to safely substitute attribute names and values. All data inputs are used as parameters and placeholders, not directly embedded into query strings. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or system sabotage. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for secure DynamoDB query construction, with proper separation of data and expression syntax. No hidden code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a legitimate utility for constructing DynamoDB condition expressions with placeholder substitution, following secure practices. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
