  "purpose": "This code provides a utility for constructing DynamoDB condition expressions with placeholders, facilitating safe query building.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, regex parsing attribute names, class attributes, and method calls for attribute conditions.",
  "sinks": "Generated expression strings with placeholders, attribute name and value dictionaries used in DynamoDB queries.",
  "flows": "Input attribute objects and condition values flow into placeholder generation, forming expression strings with associated attribute mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected. Regex used solely for formatting, not execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation for DynamoDB expression building, employing placeholders to prevent injection. It uses regex only for attribute name formatting, with no external system calls or code execution. All signals indicate safe, benign utility code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard DynamoDB expression builder with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correct. The reports and scores are accurate and require no adjustments.",
