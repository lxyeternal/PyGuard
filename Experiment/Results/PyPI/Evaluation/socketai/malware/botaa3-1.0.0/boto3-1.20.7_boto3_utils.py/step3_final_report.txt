  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing AWS SDK components, including dynamic module import, lazy invocation, attribute injection, and waiter model management.",
  "sources": "String inputs specifying module names, function names, attribute names, and data passed to functions like lazy_call, import_module, and inject_attribute.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import and invocation of functions, attribute injection into class dictionaries, and method calls on waiter models, which could lead to code execution if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input strings (module names, function names, attribute names) flow into import_module, lazy_call, and inject_attribute, potentially leading to dynamic code execution or modification if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden payloads detected. The code relies on string-based dynamic execution, which is standard but potentially risky if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for dynamic module loading and invocation, which are common in SDKs and plugin systems. No malicious payloads or obfuscated code are present. The primary security concern is the potential for misuse if external inputs are not validated, as malicious inputs could lead to arbitrary code execution. The functions are straightforward, and the code structure is clear. The risk is primarily theoretical and depends on how these functions are used; no active malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring that inputs to functions like lazy_call and inject_attribute are sanitized if they originate from untrusted sources. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential misuse but no active threats.",
