  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring that inputs to functions like lazy_call and inject_attribute are sanitized if they originate from untrusted sources. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting potential misuse but no active threats."
