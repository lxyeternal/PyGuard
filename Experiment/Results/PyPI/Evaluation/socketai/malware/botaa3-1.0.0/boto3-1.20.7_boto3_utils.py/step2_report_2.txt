  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions/classes for AWS SDK management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic module import and attribute injection based on input strings.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious actions; potential risk if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard utility code, low risk, no malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to potential misuse with untrusted input)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores seem reasonable. The report correctly identifies the potential risk from dynamic imports but finds no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, focusing on dynamic import and invocation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import and function calls, potential for code execution if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, just standard patterns that could be exploited.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Same as above, standard utility code, low risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.3 (slightly higher but still low, considering potential misuse)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis. No malware, just caution around dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for AWS SDK, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import and method invocation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just standard dynamic loading.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, no signs of malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate scores. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, focusing on dynamic import and lazy loading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic module import, attribute injection.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, just potential misuse if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low risk, standard utility code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—utility functions for dynamic import and attribute injection.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import and getattr, potential for code execution if inputs are malicious.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, but the dynamic import mechanisms could be exploited if used improperly.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malware; risk is moderate due to potential misuse.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.3 (moderate, reflecting potential misuse)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nScores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, mostly low, reflecting potential misuse if inputs are untrusted.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Around 0.2–0.3 — potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but no active threats.\n\n**In conclusion,** the scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. The code itself is standard utility code with no inherent malicious behavior, but dynamic import and attribute injection mechanisms warrant caution if used with untrusted inputs.",
