  "purpose": "Utility classes and functions to facilitate batch write and delete operations to Amazon DynamoDB, including request buffering, deduplication based on primary keys, and retry handling for unprocessed items.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (Item, Key), class attributes (_items_buffer, _table_name, _client, _overwrite_by_pkeys)",
  "sinks": "AWS DynamoDB 'batch_write_item' API call via boto3/botocore SDK",
  "flows": "Input data (Items/Keys) -> Buffer (_items_buffer) -> batch_write_item API call -> response handling (UnprocessedItems) -> buffer extension if needed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard SDK usage; no external network activity or code execution",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard DynamoDB batch writer with request buffering, deduplication based on primary keys, and retry logic for unprocessed items. It uses AWS SDK calls appropriately, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The data flow is straightforward, and no anomalies such as obfuscated code or secrets are present. The logic is consistent, and the code appears to be a legitimate utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented DynamoDB batch write utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
