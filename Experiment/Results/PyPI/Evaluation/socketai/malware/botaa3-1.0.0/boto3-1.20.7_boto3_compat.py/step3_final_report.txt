  "purpose": "Platform-specific file operations, deprecation warnings, and environment compatibility handling within AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed explicitly to functions (e.g., filenames in rename_file), environment variables, sys.platform, sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (os.remove, os.rename), warnings filter, exception handling, platform-specific code execution.",
  "flows": "Filename parameters influence os.remove and os.rename; environment info influences conditional logic; warnings filter affects runtime warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. File operations are standard and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code handles platform-specific file renaming, manages deprecation warnings, and checks Python version for deprecation notices. It uses explicit parameters for file operations, with error handling that only propagates unexpected errors. Warning filters are standard. No untrusted data sources or network activity are present. The code aligns with SDK maintenance practices and does not contain malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK utility code for environment compatibility and deprecation management. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk scores assigned are appropriate given the controlled operations.",
