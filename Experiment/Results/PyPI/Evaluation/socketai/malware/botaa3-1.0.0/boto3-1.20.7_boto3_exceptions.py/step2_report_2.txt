  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling errors in AWS SDK (boto3 and botocore).\n   - It imports `botocore.exceptions` and subclasses from `Exception` and specific botocore exceptions.\n   - The classes mainly generate descriptive error messages based on input parameters.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code appears to be standard error handling boilerplate.\n\n2. **Reported Issues**:\n   - All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, indicating the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is detected.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is not obfuscated.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), consistent with the thorough analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Overlooked Aspects**:\n   - The code is purely exception class definitions, with no external data or code execution.\n   - No supply chain vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The only minor note is the misspelling in the message string: `\"The '%s' resource does **an** API version of: %s\\n\"` should be `\"does **not** have an API version of: %s\\n\"`, but this is a trivial typo, not a security issue.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is standard, well-structured, and safe.\n   - No reason to adjust the scores; they are aligned with the content.\n   - The reports' summaries and scores are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The overall confidence remains high.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary**:\nThis supply chain report correctly identifies that the code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scoring and analysis are appropriate and consistent.",
