{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS SDK (boto3/botocore) error handling, providing specific error messages and compatibility support.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and imports, no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external calls, or sensitive data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "None; as there are no input or data flows involved in the class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of standard class definitions for exceptions with clear, descriptive messages. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exceptions for AWS service error handling, mainly related to boto3 and botocore. It includes specific error messages for missing resources, unsupported operations, and retries. No external input, output, or system interaction code is present. The use of super() vs. direct superclass constructor calls is correct. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The comments and structure suggest standard, maintainable code aimed at exception management within an SDK context.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for AWS SDK error handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and seems intended solely for error management within a Python AWS SDK library.",
