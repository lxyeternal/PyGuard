  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for AWS boto3 error handling and related scenarios.",
  "sources": "Importing botocore.exceptions; class definitions and their __init__ methods.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising within class constructors; no untrusted input processing detected.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward error class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception class definitions for boto3 error handling. It imports botocore.exceptions, then defines multiple subclasses of Exception, some with custom __init__ methods constructing error messages. The __init__ methods accept parameters and generate descriptive messages but do not process untrusted data or perform any malicious actions. No indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful code is present. The code is structured clearly, with no obfuscation, unusual language features, or suspicious logic. Overall, this is standard error handling code for AWS SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of AWS SDK-related custom exception classes designed for error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation of error classes with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. The malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
