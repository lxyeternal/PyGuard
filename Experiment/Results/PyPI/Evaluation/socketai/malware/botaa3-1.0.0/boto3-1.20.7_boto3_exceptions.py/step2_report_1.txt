  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of reports:**\nAll five reports describe the same code: a set of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, subclassing from Exception, Boto3Error, and botocore.exceptions. They generate descriptive error messages based on input parameters, with no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be standard, well-structured error handling boilerplate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that this code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant errors are evident. The only minor note is the misspelling in the message: `\"The '%s' resource does not an API version of: %s\\n\"` — missing \"have\" or \"exist\". But this is a trivial typo, not a security concern.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports.\n  - Security risk: 0 in all reports.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 in all reports.\n  - Confidence: 1 in all reports.\n\n  These seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- The code is standard exception class definitions. No code exhibits malicious behavior, no code injection, no network calls, no dynamic execution, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Therefore, malware score should remain 0.**\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- No obfuscation is present; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n**Security risk score:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data, does not contain hardcoded secrets, and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n- **Security risk score should be 0.**\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The only minor concern is the typo in one error message, but it does not impact security or functionality.\n- No assumptions about external inputs or behavior are made that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is purely boilerplate exception class definitions for AWS SDK error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is standard, well-documented, and does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations. The only minor issue is a typo in an error message, which does not impact security or functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe report accurately reflects the benign nature of this code. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and free of malware.",
