  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in AWS boto3-related code.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, error message construction, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data handling; exception messages are constructed from controlled inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; error messages are generated from internal parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions and botocore exceptions. The classes primarily format error messages using parameters passed during instantiation. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or any code that could be malicious or maliciously manipulate data. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow is observed. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as error handling infrastructure for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It functions solely to represent and format error messages related to AWS resource management. The overall security risk is negligible.",
