  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, importing from `botocore.exceptions`.\n   - The classes are straightforward, mainly constructing error messages with provided parameters.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of sensitive data is present.\n   - The code appears to be standard, boilerplate exception class definitions.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior or Anomalies:**\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - Exception messages are constructed from controlled parameters, with no indication of untrusted data processing.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - The exception classes are purely for error reporting and do not interact with external systems or data sources.\n   - The use of `super()` and direct superclass constructor calls is correct and standard.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0. Given the absence of any malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behavior, this is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0. The code is standard error handling infrastructure with no security implications.\n\n5. **Assessment of Reported Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are evident.\n   - The confidence in these assessments is high.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is purely for defining exception classes for AWS SDK error handling.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
