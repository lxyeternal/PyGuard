{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, providing descriptive error messages based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from constructor parameters used to generate error messages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects; the code only constructs messages from controlled inputs.",
  "flows": "The flow is from constructor parameters (sources) to error message generation; no external data flow or dynamic execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions for AWS SDK error handling, importing 'botocore.exceptions' and subclassing from Exception and specific botocore exceptions. It constructs descriptive error messages from parameters, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is well-structured, and the exception messages are controlled. The minor typo in one message ('does an API version') is insignificant and does not impact security or functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard error handling boilerplate for AWS SDK, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
