  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various errors in boto3-related AWS SDK operations.",
  "sources": "Importing botocore.exceptions and defining custom error classes that generate error messages based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings used in exception initialization, potentially logged or displayed, but no data sinks involving untrusted data flow are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters for exceptions (service_name, available_services, bad_api_version, etc.) flow into message construction for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward and typical of error handling classes.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes for AWS SDK error handling, subclassing from standard exceptions and botocore exceptions. Exception messages are constructed dynamically using input parameters, but no untrusted data processing or network activity occurs. The structure is standard for a Python error hierarchy, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for boto3 error handling. No malicious activity, supply chain sabotage, or security risks are detected. The code is benign and purely for error management.",
