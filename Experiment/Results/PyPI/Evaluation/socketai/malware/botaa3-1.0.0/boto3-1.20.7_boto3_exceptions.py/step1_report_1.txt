  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for boto3 and botocore error handling in AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statement for botocore.exceptions; class constructors that generate error messages.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings generated in exception initializers.",
  "flows": "Error conditions lead to instantiation of exceptions which format and store messages and possibly other data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. The code follows standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom exceptions for handling specific AWS SDK errors, subclassing from Exception and botocore exceptions. Error messages are constructed with provided parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be standard error handling boilerplate for AWS SDK extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured exception class definitions for AWS SDK error handling. No malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks identified.",
