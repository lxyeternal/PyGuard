  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling AWS SDK (boto3 and botocore) errors.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The exception classes primarily format error messages based on input parameters.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted data processing are present.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The reported issues are not present; the code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, securityRisk = 0) are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- The detailed analysis supports that there is no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is purely for error handling, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- The exception messages are constructed from controlled parameters, not untrusted input.\n- No suspicious anomalies or vulnerabilities are identified.\n- The code's purpose aligns with standard SDK error handling practices.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed to the scoring or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code is benign, standard, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
