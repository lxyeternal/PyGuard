  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for displaying terminal colors. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high risk scores in some reports (0.9 or 1.0) are unjustified; appropriate risk score is 0. The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0. The slight elevation of securityRisk to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary; it should be 0. given the benign nature."
