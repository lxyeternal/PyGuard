{
  "purpose": "The code displays a color grid in the terminal by printing colored characters with various foreground, background, and style combinations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from sys.stdout for output and imports modules such as sys, __future__, and colourama (local source assumed).",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is sys.stdout.write for printing colored output; no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input sources are from imported modules and possibly user environment, but no untrusted input flows are evident; output is directed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code purely handles display logic.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama, sets up color and style lists, maps color constants to names, and prints a formatted grid of color samples. It uses standard library and third-party modules in a safe manner, with no dynamic code execution or external data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for terminal display of color samples and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs benign operations with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
