  "purpose": "Display a grid of all terminal colors and brightness levels using ANSI escape sequences for visual demonstration.",
  "sources": "Static code with no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; purely static output to stdout.",
  "flows": "N/A - static display; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'fixpath' module, which is not provided; likely for local path adjustments, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward terminal color grid display using the colorama library. It imports 'fixpath' without evidence of malicious intent; no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The import of 'fixpath' is likely benign, used for local environment setup. The code's purpose is purely visual and static, with no handling of sensitive data or external sources.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for displaying terminal colors. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high risk scores in some reports (0.9 or 1.0) are unjustified; appropriate risk score is 0. The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0. The slight elevation of securityRisk to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary; it should be 0. given the benign nature.",
