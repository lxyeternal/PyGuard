  "purpose": "Demonstrates terminal cursor movement using colorama for visual effects.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses colorama cursor control sequences.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Cursor movement commands are embedded in print statements to produce specific terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'fixpath'; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, performs cursor movements, and outputs static text for visual terminal effects. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The 'fixpath' import is unused but not harmful. The cursor control sequences are standard for terminal UI demonstrations. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal cursor control with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is the unused 'fixpath' import, which does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting negligible risk due to the extraneous import. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
