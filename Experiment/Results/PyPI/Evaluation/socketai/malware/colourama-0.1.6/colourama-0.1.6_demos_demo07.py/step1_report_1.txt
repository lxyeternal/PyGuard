  "purpose": "Demonstrate cursor relative movement using the colorama library in Python.",
  "sources": "Standard input (not used), colorama.Cursor constants, and the print function (standard output).",
  "sinks": "The print statements outputting cursor movement commands and text to the terminal.",
  "flows": "The code constructs terminal escape sequences for cursor movements and outputs text, but there is no flow leading to untrusted data or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The use of colorama's cursor movement appears standard and intended for terminal display manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports colorama and demonstrates cursor movement commands like UP, DOWN, FORWARD, and BACK in terminal output. It initializes colorama, then performs a sequence of print statements interleaved with cursor movement escape sequences. All code appears to serve a benign purpose of visual terminal manipulation. No external data input, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code relies solely on standard library and well-known third-party library functions for display effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless demonstration of terminal cursor control using the colorama library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is purely for visual output manipulation.",
