{
  "purpose": "Terminal visual demonstration that displays randomly colored characters within a bordered area for aesthetic effect.",
  "sources": "Standard libraries: random.randint, random.choice, string.printable, colorama for ANSI escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or data leakage points detected.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves generating random positions and styles, then printing characters at those positions; no external or untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward use of standard libraries and ANSI sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes terminal coloring, draws a static border, then repeatedly prints randomly styled characters at random positions within the border for 1000 passes. It uses only standard libraries and ANSI escape sequences for terminal control. No input, network activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious commands are present. The purpose is purely visual, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign terminal animation tool with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
