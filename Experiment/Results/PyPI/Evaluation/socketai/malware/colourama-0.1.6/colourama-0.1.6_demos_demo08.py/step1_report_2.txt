  "purpose": "The code initializes color formatting in terminal output and demonstrates changing text color to green and resetting it.",
  "sources": "Import of colorama_text and Fore from colorama, which are used for terminal text styling.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output styled text to stdout.",
  "flows": "Source (import and usage of colorama) → print statements that output styled text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. No data leakage, backdoors, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'fixpath' (whose purpose is unknown, but it could be a local module), and uses 'colorama' to manipulate terminal text colors. The main() function wraps print statements within a context manager for colorama, changing the text color to green and then resetting it. There are no untrusted data inputs, no external network connections, no system modifications, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be purely for visual terminal output styling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal text coloring using 'colorama'. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity are detected.",
