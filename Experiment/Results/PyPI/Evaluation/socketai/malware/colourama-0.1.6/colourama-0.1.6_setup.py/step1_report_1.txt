{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'colourama', including custom install behavior that executes obfuscated code, and performs a network request during the install process.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the filesystem (README.rst, setup files), and from a URL request to 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF'.",
  "sinks": "The network request to 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF' during the install process is a potential data exfiltration or tracking sink. The obfuscated code executed during the custom install class can also act as a sink if it performs malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Code reads local files and executes obfuscated code in the run method of TotallyInnocentClass. During installation, it sends an HTTP request to a suspicious URL, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The obfuscated base64-decoded code appears to perform network communication and URL fetching.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded, obfuscated code executed in an install script, which attempts to connect to an external URL and fetch data. The code is intentionally obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide malicious behavior. The network request to 'grabify.link', a known URL shortener often used for tracking or malicious purposes, is suspicious. The code is executed during the package installation phase, which is unusual for benign packages.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a class 'TotallyInnocentClass' that overrides the 'run' method to execute base64-encoded code, which is decoded and executed at runtime. This code makes an HTTP request to 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF' with a custom User-Agent based on the platform system. The use of obfuscation and network activity during installation strongly suggests malicious intent or privacy violation. The rest of the setup code appears normal, handling version parsing and package metadata. The presence of obfuscated code executed during install is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains obfuscated code that executes during installation, making network requests to a suspicious URL, indicating potential malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or user tracking. The code's primary purpose appears malicious or privacy-invasive, with high suspicion of malware presence.",
