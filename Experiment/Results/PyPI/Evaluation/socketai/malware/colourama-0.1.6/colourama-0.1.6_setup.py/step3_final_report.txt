{
  "purpose": "The code executes obfuscated base64-encoded payload during installation, which makes a network request to 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF' with a custom User-Agent, indicating potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated base64 string decoded and executed via exec() within the run() method of TotallyInnocentClass; the network request to 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF' using urllib2.Request; the code reads input from the decoded payload and system info via platform.system().",
  "sinks": "The decoded payload executed with exec() potentially runs arbitrary code; the network request to the suspicious URL could exfiltrate data; the use of exec() on decoded data is a sink for malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Source: Base64-encoded string decoded in run() -> Sink: exec() executes decoded code -> Network request to 'grabify.link' during run() -> Potential data exfiltration or malicious command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated base64 payload decoded and executed at runtime; network request during package setup; use of exec() on decoded payload; code contacts a known tracking/malicious URL; code runs during installation phase, which is unusual for benign packages.",
  "analysis": "The code contains heavily obfuscated base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed during the setup process, which makes an outbound network request to a suspicious URL. The use of exec() on decoded data indicates dynamic code execution, a common red flag for malicious behavior. The network request to 'grabify.link' suggests potential data exfiltration or tracking. The code's execution during installation increases the risk of system compromise. The obfuscation and network activity are consistent indicators of malicious intent, with high confidence that this code is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits clear malicious behavior through obfuscated code execution and external network communication to a known tracking URL. The high obfuscation, active network activity, and code execution during setup justify assigning maximum malware and security risk scores. The code should be considered malicious, and the package should be flagged accordingly.",
