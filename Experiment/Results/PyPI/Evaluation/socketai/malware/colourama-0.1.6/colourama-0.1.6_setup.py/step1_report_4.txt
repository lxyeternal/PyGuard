{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package called 'colourama', including package metadata and installation procedures.",
  "sources": "Reads from the file system for package description, version info, and other files; also makes an HTTP request to a suspicious URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically decoded base64 code; HTTP request to a hardcoded URL; potential for code injection via exec()",
  "flows": "The base64 decoded string is executed via exec(), which is fetched and decoded during runtime; the HTTP request occurs immediately upon execution, with no validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), which could contain malicious code. The code makes an HTTP request to a suspicious URL (grabify.link). The 'exec' call executes code that appears obfuscated. The code references a non-standard attribute '__future__' import for 'with_statement', which is redundant in Python 2.5+.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up a Python package with metadata and dependencies. However, it includes a significant obfuscated base64-encoded string that, when decoded, is executed with exec(). This decoded code makes an HTTP request to a suspicious URL, potentially exfiltrating data or executing malicious payloads. The code also calls out to an external URL during import, which is suspicious behavior. There are no apparent inputs from external untrusted sources other than the static URL and the obfuscated code, which could be malicious. The package's setup and version retrieval functions are standard, but the inclusion and execution of obfuscated code is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated payload that executes dynamically and contacts a suspicious external URL, indicating likely malicious behavior. The code's primary purpose appears to be a standard setup, but the embedded obfuscated code and external contact points suggest malicious intent or sabotage. Overall, this package should be considered highly suspicious and potentially harmful.",
