{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package called 'colourama', providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads files for long description and version information, and makes HTTP requests to a suspicious URL during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The URL request could be a data exfiltration sink; base64-decoded exec string executes potentially malicious code; file reading exposes local file contents.",
  "flows": "Code reads local files for package info -> During class run, executes a base64 payload that makes an HTTP request to an external URL, potentially exfiltrating data.",
  "anomalies": "Base64 encoded payload decoded and executed within class run; HTTP request to a suspicious domain ('grabify.link') during class instantiation; use of exec with decoded payload.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a setup script for a Python package, reading package info from files and defining package metadata. However, it contains a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, executes code to send an HTTP request to 'https://grabify.link/E09EIF'. This request appears to be used as a communication or exfiltration channel. The exec function executes the decoded string, which is suspicious. Additionally, the code makes requests to an external domain during class run, which is unusual for a typical setup script. The rest of the code, such as file reading and package setup, appears benign and typical.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior in the form of executing decoded payload that makes an outbound request to a suspicious URL, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious command execution. The presence of obfuscated payload and network activity during package setup is highly suspicious.",
