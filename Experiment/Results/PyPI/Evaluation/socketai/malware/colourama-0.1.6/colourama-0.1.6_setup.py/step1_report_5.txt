{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'colourama', including configuration for packaging, version extraction, and installation. It also contains a potentially malicious embedded payload that performs network requests and executes obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Reading local files (e.g., README.rst, package files), environment variables, and system information; the embedded exec() with base64 decoding performs hidden code execution; URL request to grabify.link",
  "sinks": "exec() with decoded base64 code (exec executes arbitrary code); urllib2.urlopen to fetch external content; potential data exfiltration or malicious command execution via obfuscated code",
  "flows": "Code reads local files and environment info; executes obfuscated code via exec; makes network request to external domain; decoded code runs URL request and executes further code, potentially exfiltrating data or executing malicious commands",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded string decoded and executed via exec(), which is suspicious; obfuscated code with redundant imports; network request to a suspicious domain; unusual use of multiple imports and redundant code structures; inline code within class method that is unrelated to package setup",
  "analysis": "Initial code imports several modules, including requests and urllib2, and defines a class 'TotallyInnocentClass' that overrides the install method. Inside this method, there is an exec() call with a base64-decoded string that, when decoded, contains code performing system information collection, URL request to a suspicious domain ('grabify.link'), and further URL-based operations. The presence of this obfuscated code is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious behavior. The rest of the script handles package setup tasks, version extraction, and reading files, which are standard. The embedded base64 code is likely a backdoor or a data exfiltration mechanism. The code does not appear to be part of legitimate package functionality, indicating malicious intent. The obfuscation, network request to suspicious domain, and use of exec() strongly suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains obfuscated, malicious payload embedded within a seemingly innocent setup script. The code executes hidden code that makes external network requests and could be used for data theft or remote command execution. This indicates malicious intent and potential compromise of systems installing this package.",
