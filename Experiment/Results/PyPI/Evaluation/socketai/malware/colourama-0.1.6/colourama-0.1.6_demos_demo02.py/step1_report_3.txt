  "purpose": "Demonstration of changing text foreground, background, and brightness styles in terminal output.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, fixpath, and colourama; use of print statements with style variables.",
  "sinks": "Print statements with style variables; no data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input data from imports (none untrusted); flow is static styling applied directly in print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports styling modules and initializes colourama. It then prints styled text with foreground, background, and style changes. No user input, network activity, or data leaks present. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs detected. The code serves a visual demonstration purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of styling terminal output with colourama. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
