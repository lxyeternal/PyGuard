  "purpose": "Demonstration of changing foreground, background, and style attributes using the colourama library.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, fixpath module, and colourama library initialization.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print function). No untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to output; all data is static string literals and style commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard library functions and straightforward string concatenation for output.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future print_function for compatibility, initializes colourama for terminal styling, and outputs styled text with various foreground, background, and style attributes. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code's purpose is purely visual output demonstration. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal styling capabilities using the colourama library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
