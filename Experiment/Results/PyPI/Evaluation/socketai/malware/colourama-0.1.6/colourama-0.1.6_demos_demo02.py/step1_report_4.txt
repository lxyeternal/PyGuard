  "purpose": "Demonstration of changing foreground, background, and style brightness using the colourama library.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the print function which uses colourama's Fore, Back, and Style to generate styled console output.",
  "sinks": "The print function outputs styled text to the console; no external data or untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "No external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only formats static strings with colourama styles and outputs them.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is a straightforward demonstration script.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colourama, then outputs styled text with different foreground and background colours and styles. It uses static strings and standard library functions without any external input, dynamic code execution, or data leakage mechanisms. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of colourama's styling capabilities with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
