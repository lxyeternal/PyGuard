  "purpose": "Demonstration of changing text foreground, background, and style using the colourama library.",
  "sources": "import statements for 'fixpath', 'colourama.init', 'Fore', 'Back', 'Style'",
  "sinks": "Printing to standard output using print() with colourama styling",
  "flows": "Code reads static input (no external data sources), flows from import statements to print outputs with styling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules including 'fixpath' and 'colourama', initializes colourama, and prints styled text with foreground, background, and style changes. No user input, external data, or system modifications are present. The 'fixpath' import appears to be for environment setup, but its content is unknown; it could be a local module. The code performs a simple demonstration of styling text with no malicious logic or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of colourama styling features with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
