  "purpose": "Demo of changing foreground, background, and style brightness in terminal output using colourama.",
  "sources": "Import statements and code that outputs styled text to the terminal.",
  "sinks": "Output functions (print) that display styled text; no data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply outputs static styled text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes colourama, and prints styled text with various foreground, background, and style effects. No external input handling or untrusted data processing is present. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of colourama features, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of terminal styling features using colourama, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
