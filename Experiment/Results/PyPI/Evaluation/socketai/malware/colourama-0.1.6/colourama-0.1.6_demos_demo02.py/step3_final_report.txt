{
  "purpose": "Demonstration of terminal styling using colourama library features.",
  "sources": "Static code with no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A - static demonstration; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports colourama, initializes it, and prints styled text with various foreground, background, and style effects. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The import of 'fixpath' appears to be for environment setup, not malicious activity. The code is static, simple, and intended solely for demonstration purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static demonstration of terminal styling with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
