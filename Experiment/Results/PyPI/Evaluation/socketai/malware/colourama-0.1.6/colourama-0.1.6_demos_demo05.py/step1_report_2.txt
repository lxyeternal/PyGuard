  "purpose": "Demonstrate how colorama initializes and manages ANSI escape sequences with wrapping enabled and disabled on different platforms.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, environment variables (implicitly via colorama initialization), imported modules",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout, AnsiToWin32 function writes to stdout",
  "flows": "Colorama initialization affects how ANSI sequences are processed when printing to stdout, including when wrapping is disabled",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs straightforward ANSI color output management.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes the colorama library multiple times with different wrapping configurations to demonstrate ANSI escape sequence handling. It uses sys.stdout and the AnsiToWin32 class to output colored text, depending on platform behavior. No data is read from or written to untrusted sources beyond standard output, and there are no malicious functions or code behaviors. The code appears purely demonstrative without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless demonstration of colorama's initialization and ANSI handling on different platforms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or malware. It uses standard library functions and straightforward logic.",
