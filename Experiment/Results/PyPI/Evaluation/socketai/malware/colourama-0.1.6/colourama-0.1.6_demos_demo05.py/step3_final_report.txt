  "purpose": "Demonstrate the difference between colorama initialized with wrapping on and off, showing cross-platform ANSI handling.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, AnsiToWin32, colorama's init function",
  "sinks": "Console output via print, AnsiToWin32 writing to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Initialization with colorama -> printing colored text -> optional use of AnsiToWin32 for unwrapped output",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'fixpath', but no malicious or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of colorama's features, with multiple init calls to toggle wrapping, and printing colored text. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import of 'fixpath' is unused but benign. The code does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or credential handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and educational nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely demonstrative. No signs of malicious activity or security issues are present. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
