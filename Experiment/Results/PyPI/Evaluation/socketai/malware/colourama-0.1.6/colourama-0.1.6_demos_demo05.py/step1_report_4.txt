  "purpose": "Demonstrate the usage of the colorama library for colorized output with wrapping enabled and disabled.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout (via the print function and AnsiToWin32 wrapper)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (outputting colorized text), AnsiToWin32 function writing to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Input (colorama commands) -> AnsiToWin32 wrapper or print output -> sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no hidden network calls or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and initializes the colorama library to demonstrate its behavior with wrapping enabled and disabled on Windows. It uses standard functions and methods without any suspicious modifications or dynamic code execution. The code interacts only with standard output and uses the colorama library as intended for cross-platform ANSI support. No evidence of malicious payload, backdoors, or malicious side effects is present. The usage appears to be purely demonstrative and educational.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a harmless demonstration of the colorama library's features. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
