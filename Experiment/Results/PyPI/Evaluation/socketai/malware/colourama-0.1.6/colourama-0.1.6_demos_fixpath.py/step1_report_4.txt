  "purpose": "Adjusts sys.path to prioritize local 'colorama' module during import, likely for development or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file's directory (__file__), constructs a path to its parent directory.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path to include a custom directory, affecting module import resolution.",
  "flows": "__file__ -> dirname(__file__) -> join(...) -> sys.path.insert()",
  "anomalies": "The code modifies sys.path at runtime to prioritize local modules, which is common in development environments. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os.path modules to manipulate module search paths. It constructs the path to the parent directory of the current script and inserts it at the beginning of sys.path. This ensures that when 'import colorama' is called later, it will prefer the local module in the parent directory over any installed version. This is typical in development setups. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The purpose appears to be to facilitate local testing or development rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard development pattern to override module import paths. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
