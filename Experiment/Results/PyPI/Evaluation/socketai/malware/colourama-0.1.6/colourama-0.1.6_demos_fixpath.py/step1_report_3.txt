  "purpose": "Modify sys.path to prioritize local source code for the 'colorama' module.",
  "sources": "Reads the current script's directory (__file__) and the system path (sys.path).",
  "sinks": "Alters sys.path by inserting a directory at index 0, affecting module import resolution.",
  "flows": "The code uses __file__ to determine the local directory, then inserts that directory at the start of sys.path, influencing subsequent imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code performs a standard path adjustment for local module development.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and os.path modules, then calculates the parent directory of the current script (__file__). It inserts this directory at the beginning of sys.path to prioritize local module imports over installed packages. This is a common development practice and does not exhibit any malicious activity or suspicious behavior. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data leaks present. The license comment is standard, and the import modification is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code adjusts the module import path to favor local source code during development. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a typical setup for local module testing or development.",
