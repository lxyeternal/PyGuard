  "purpose": "Adjusts sys.path to prioritize local modules, facilitating development or testing by ensuring local 'colorama' source is imported over installed versions.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ to determine current script location, uses os.path functions to compute parent directory.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path by inserting the computed directory at index 0.",
  "flows": "Reads __file__ -> computes parent directory -> inserts into sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path manipulation; no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates the parent directory of the current script and inserts it at the beginning of sys.path to ensure local module resolution. It uses standard library functions without any obfuscation or network activity. The purpose is typical for development environments. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The modification of sys.path is benign in this context, though it could be misused in untrusted environments, but no such misuse is evident here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard development pattern for local module prioritization. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
