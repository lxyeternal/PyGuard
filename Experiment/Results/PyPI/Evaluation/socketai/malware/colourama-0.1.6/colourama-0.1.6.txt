      "conclusion": "The package exhibits clear malicious behavior through obfuscated code execution and external network communication to a known tracking URL. The high obfuscation, active network activity, and code execution during setup justify assigning maximum malware and security risk scores. The code should be considered malicious, and the package should be flagged accordingly."

The high risk scores in some reports (0.9 or 1.0) are unjustified; appropriate risk score is 0. The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0. The slight elevation of securityRisk to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary; it should be 0. given the benign nature."
