  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature when formatting terminal output with different settings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, fixpath, and colorama; print statements with formatting commands.",
  "sinks": "Terminal output (console), which could potentially be manipulated if input included malicious escape sequences or commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only outputs formatted text to the terminal without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a local 'fixpath' (likely for setup, not malicious). It initializes colorama with autoreset set to True, then outputs formatted text, then reinitializes with autoreset False and outputs more formatted text. There are no sources of untrusted input, no network activity, and no data leakage or malicious commands. The code simply demonstrates color formatting behavior in the terminal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of color formatting features in a terminal application. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
