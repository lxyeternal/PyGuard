{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset option in terminal output coloring.",
  "sources": "Imports fixpath and colourama modules, especially the init() function to set terminal coloring behaviors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, initializing colorama with different settings, to printing colored output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries for terminal output coloring.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and colorama, then initializes terminal coloring with autoreset enabled and disabled to show different behaviors. No external data input, no data processing, no suspicious function calls or hidden operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears solely for demonstration purposes, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of colorama's color resetting behavior, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious patterns detected.",
