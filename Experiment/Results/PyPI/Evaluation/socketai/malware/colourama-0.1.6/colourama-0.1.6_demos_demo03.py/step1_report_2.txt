  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset option in terminal text formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ (print_function), fixpath, and colourama modules; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "Print statements which output colored text to the terminal; no data leakage or untrusted data handling involved.",
  "flows": "Imports and initialization of colourama -> print statements with formatting options.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and primarily for demonstration; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes colourama with autoreset set to True and then False to demonstrate formatting behavior. It outputs colored text to the terminal. There is no user input, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The code is for illustrative purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, intended for demonstrating color formatting behavior. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
