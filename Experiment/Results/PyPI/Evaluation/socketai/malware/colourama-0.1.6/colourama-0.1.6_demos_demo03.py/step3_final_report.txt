  "purpose": "Demonstrate the behavior of colorama's autoreset feature with different settings.",
  "sources": "Terminal output commands, import of 'fixpath' (unused).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Initialization of colorama -> print with color settings -> second initialization -> print with different color settings.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import 'fixpath', but no malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama with 'autoreset=True' and prints colored text, then reinitializes with 'autoreset=False' and prints again. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved. The 'fixpath' import is unused but harmless. No obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and serves as a demonstration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The only minor inefficiency is the unused 'fixpath' import. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero. The code is safe for use and does not warrant concern.",
