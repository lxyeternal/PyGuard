  "purpose": "Collects and formats system and network information, then sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (user home directory, MAC address), performs HTTP GET requests to external APIs for IP and geolocation data, decodes a base64-encoded webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via POST request to the decoded webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Reads system data -> Requests external APIs for IP and geolocation -> Formats data -> Sends data to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded base64-encoded webhook URL, no user input handling, no evident validation or encryption of transmitted data, possibly revealing sensitive system info to external endpoint.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system details such as username, MAC address, and external IP-based geolocation. It formats this data into a JSON payload and posts it to a webhook URL that is decoded from base64. The webhook URL is hardcoded in encoded form, which may suggest obfuscation or concealment. The data transmitted includes potentially sensitive system information (user name, MAC address, IP geolocation) without any encryption or user consent. There are no signs of malicious payload execution, but the exfiltration of detailed system info to an external server can be considered suspicious and potentially malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily exfiltrates system and network information to an external webhook. While it does not contain overt malware behaviors such as reverse shells or data theft from other sources, it exhibits privacy-invasive behavior. The use of obfuscated URL and the lack of user consent or transparency could be malicious in some scenarios. Overall, it presents a security concern related to unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
