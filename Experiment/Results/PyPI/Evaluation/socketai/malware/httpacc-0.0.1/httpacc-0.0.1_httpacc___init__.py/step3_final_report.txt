  "purpose": "The code collects system information (username, MAC address, IP, geolocation) and exfiltrates it via a base64-obfuscated webhook URL.",
  "sources": [
    "os.path.expanduser(\"~\") for username",
    "uuid.getnode() for MAC address",
    "requests.get('https://api.ipify.org/') for IP address",
    "requests.get(f\"http://ip-api.com/json/{ip}?\") for geolocation data"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "requests.post(webhook, json=data) for data exfiltration"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Collect username, MAC, IP, geolocation -> format data -> send via POST request to decoded webhook URL"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of base64 decoding for webhook URL as obfuscation",
    "Data exfiltration occurs without user consent or validation",
    "No malicious payloads or system modifications present"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system info and transmits it to an external server, using base64 to obfuscate the webhook URL. It does not perform malicious actions like system damage or privilege escalation but exfiltrates data silently, which is privacy-invasive. The obfuscation is mild, and the data collection is straightforward. The behavior aligns with privacy violation rather than active malware. Malware scores are low (around 0.2-0.3), reflecting no malicious payloads, but the privacy risk score is higher (around 0.6-0.75) due to unconsented data exfiltration. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), justified by the use of base64 encoding. Overall, the code poses a privacy concern with potential for misuse, but lacks active malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a privacy-invasive data collector that exfiltrates system info without user consent. It employs mild obfuscation and does not contain malicious payloads. The behavior warrants a low malware score (~0.2), moderate obfuscation (~0.5), and a high security risk (~0.75) due to privacy violation. It should be treated with caution, especially if used without user awareness.",
