{
  "purpose": "The code collects system and network information and sends it to a remote webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (user's home directory path, MAC address, IP address), retrieves IP-based geolocation data, and reads environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data to a remote webhook URL via HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "Reads system info and network data (sources) -> formats data -> encodes webhook URL -> sends data via POST (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Base64 decoding of the webhook URL is unnecessary obfuscation; the URL is static after decoding. The code captures and transmits sensitive data without user consent or validation, which could be malicious. The user agent is not specified, which might hide intent. No validation or safeguards are in place.",
  "analysis": "The script collects user and network information including hostname, MAC address, and geolocation data via external API calls. It then constructs a JSON payload embedding this data, including the user's PC name, MAC address, and formatted geolocation info. The webhook URL is base64-encoded, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but decoding reveals a straightforward URL. The data is posted to this URL without user consent or explicit notification. There are no apparent malicious actions like system modification, file access, or privilege escalation. The main concern is data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a data collector and exfiltrator, gathering user system info and sending it to a remote server. While technically not malware, it performs potentially malicious behavior by secretly transmitting sensitive data. The obfuscation of the webhook URL and lack of user consent suggest malicious intent or at least privacy violation.",
