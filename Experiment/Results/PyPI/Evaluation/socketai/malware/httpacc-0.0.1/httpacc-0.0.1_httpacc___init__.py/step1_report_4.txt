{
  "purpose": "The code collects system and network information and sends it to a remote webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (`os.path.expanduser`), MAC address (`uuid.getnode()`), IP address (`requests.get('https://api.ipify.org/')`), and geolocation data (`requests.get(f\"http://ip-api.com/json/{ip}\")`).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST request to a decoded webhook URL (`requests.post(webhook, json=data)`).",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, MAC, IP, geolocation) is gathered, formatted, and then transmitted via an HTTP POST request to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, which can obscure its true destination. The code does not validate or restrict the data transmission, potentially leading to privacy leaks. No user input is processed, but system data is exfiltrated unconditionally.",
  "analysis": "The script collects machine-specific information such as hostname, MAC address, public IP, and geolocation data. It formats this information into a JSON payload with a title and description. The webhook URL is obfuscated using base64 encoding and then decoded before use, which is a common technique to hide the endpoint. The data is sent without user consent or additional validation. The overall behavior indicates data exfiltration of system details to a remote server, which could be malicious depending on intent. No malicious code execution or malicious payloads are present, but the data collection and transmission pattern is suspicious for privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs system info collection and sends it to a remote server via a hidden webhook URL. While technically not malware, its behavior resembles data exfiltration, raising security and privacy concerns. It does not show clear malicious payloads but could be used maliciously for surveillance or unauthorized data collection.",
