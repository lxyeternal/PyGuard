  "purpose": "Collect and send PC information including username, MAC address, and geolocation data via a webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system username, MAC address, and makes HTTP GET requests to retrieve IP and geolocation data.",
  "targets": "Sends data to an external webhook URL, which could potentially be used for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Reads system info -> fetches IP and location data -> formats data -> posts to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding for the webhook URL, which could be an attempt to obfuscate the endpoint. The URL itself appears to be a placeholder but is base64-encoded, indicating potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system username and MAC address, retrieves external IP and geolocation data through requests to external APIs, formats this info, and posts it to a URL decoded from base64. The use of external data retrieval and obfuscated webhook URL suggests intent to exfiltrate user information. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as data theft beyond info gathering, backdoors, or system damage. The obfuscation of the webhook URL could be suspicious but may also be a simple obfuscation measure. Overall, the script could be used for malicious data collection if misused, but it does not include malicious code or malware functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily gathers system and network info and sends it to an external webhook, with slight obfuscation of the webhook URL. No malicious payloads or malicious behavior such as data theft beyond info collection or system manipulation are present. It poses a privacy risk but not malware. Moderate security concern due to data exfiltration potential.",
