  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.txt' and 'CHANGELOG.txt' files for long_description; specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Includes 'base64' in 'install_requires', which is part of Python's standard library, making this unnecessary; reads files without error handling; 'url' field is empty.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The inclusion of 'base64' as an external dependency is redundant and may suggest oversight or minimal obfuscation. File reads lack error handling, which could cause runtime errors but does not impact security. No network activity or code injection is present. All reports correctly identify this as benign with malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to minor oversights, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward Python package setup script with minor oversights such as unnecessary dependency inclusion and lack of error handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
