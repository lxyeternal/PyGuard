      "conclusion": "The code is a privacy-invasive data collector that exfiltrates system info without user consent. It employs mild obfuscation and does not contain malicious payloads. The behavior warrants a low malware score (~0.2), moderate obfuscation (~0.5), and a high security risk (~0.75) due to privacy violation. It should be treated with caution, especially if used without user awareness."
