  "purpose": "A simple Python print statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No input sources, data flows, or external data reading; static code only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, external connections, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code executes a benign print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with no inputs, data flows, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
