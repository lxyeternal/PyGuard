  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, involving remote code download and execution embedded within a package setup script. The attempt to install 'subprocess' appears to be an obfuscation tactic. The high malware and security risk scores are justified by the behavior. This code should be flagged as highly dangerous and removed from any supply chain or repository."
