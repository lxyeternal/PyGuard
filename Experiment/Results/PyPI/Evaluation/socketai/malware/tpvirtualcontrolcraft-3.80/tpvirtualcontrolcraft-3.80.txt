      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload that contacts a malicious-looking URL, executed silently based on filesystem state. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity, such as payload download or remote control, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.85. The obfuscation score of 0.8 is justified by the encoded command. Overall, the package should be considered malicious or dangerous until further analysis confirms benign intent."
