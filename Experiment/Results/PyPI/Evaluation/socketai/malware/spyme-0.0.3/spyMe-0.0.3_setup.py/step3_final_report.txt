{
  "purpose": "The code downloads malicious executables from a local server and executes one in the background, likely establishing remote control or surveillance capabilities.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' endpoints for 'listener_exe', 'payload_exe', and 'Rshell_exe'; reading command-line argument 'install'.",
  "sinks": "Writing executables to 'C:\\Windows\\Temp\\'; executing 'Alistener.exe' via subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "Download executables from localhost -> save to temp directory -> execute 'Alistener.exe' in background.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URLs pointing to localhost; downloading and executing executables without validation; trigger only on 'install' argument.",
  "analysis": "The script downloads three executables from a local server, saves them in a system directory, and runs one silently in the background. The behavior aligns with malicious activity such as establishing backdoors, keyloggers, or reverse shells. The code lacks validation of downloaded files, uses hardcoded paths, and is triggered only during installation, indicating malicious intent. The straightforward nature of the code and its actions confirm its malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to download and execute payloads for remote control or surveillance. It exhibits typical malware behavior with high risk and no benign justification. The malware score is 1, security risk is 1, and obfuscation is 0. The behavior warrants immediate security attention.",
