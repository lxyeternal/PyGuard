{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information, user data, browser data (like passwords, cookies, history), Discord tokens, and other sensitive information from the user's machine, then exfiltrate it via Discord webhooks.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser profile files, leveldb logs, SQLite databases, environment variables, Windows system commands, and network requests to gather system info, Discord tokens, saved passwords, cookies, browsing history, and credit card info.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration occurs via Discord webhook, where the script sends embedded messages containing collected data, including sensitive tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info, often attaching screenshots or zipped data files.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources such as leveldb logs, SQLite databases, and environment variables are processed (decrypted or parsed), then sent to the webhook, often after decryption or data extraction, forming source-to-sink data flows that leak sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "The code is designed to extract, decrypt, and transmit sensitive data from various browsers and system components. It includes malicious activities like token theft, password extraction, system info logging, and data exfiltration. It also creates persistence mechanisms (registry modifications, self-copying). The code is obfuscated in structure and employs techniques to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script collects a wide array of sensitive information: Discord tokens by scanning local storage and leveldb files, decrypts stored passwords and cookies from browsers, retrieves system info including HWID and network data, and captures screenshots. It then compiles this data into Discord embed messages sent to a webhook, indicating data exfiltration intent. It also includes persistence mechanisms, process checks to evade debugging, and hardcoded webhook URLs and sensitive patterns. These behaviors suggest malicious intent, aimed at credential theft, system reconnaissance, and covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to stealthily harvest user credentials, tokens, system info, and browser data, then exfiltrate via Discord webhook. It employs obfuscation, persistence, and anti-debug measures. Overall, this is a high-severity threat with clear intentions for unauthorized data theft and system compromise.",
