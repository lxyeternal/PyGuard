{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a comprehensive data extraction and information gathering from the system, browsers, Discord accounts, and network details, and then report this information to a Discord webhook. It includes malicious capabilities such as token stealing, password extraction, system info collection, and browser data theft.",
  "sources": "Data sources include system environment variables, process lists, network requests to check IP/MAC, browser local storage and database files for credentials, cookies, history, and credit card data, Windows registry and system commands for hardware IDs, and user profile information.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into the Discord webhook via embedded messages and files, transmitting sensitive user data, system information, credentials, tokens, and browser data to an external server controlled by the attacker.",
  "flows": "Sources such as system info, browser data, Discord tokens, and network info flow directly to the webhook as embedded messages and file attachments, enabling remote exfiltration of gathered sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains extensive data theft functionalities including decrypting stored Discord tokens, extracting browser passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, and system identifiers. It also kills processes associated with debugging tools, and the presence of hardcoded Discord webhook URL and token extraction routines indicate malicious intent. The code also performs self-copying and persistence setup, typical of malware. No obfuscation is detected, but the code's comprehensive data exfiltration and self-preservation behaviors are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes multiple modules: it checks for debugging and sandbox environments, extracts system info, browser credentials, and Discord tokens, and then exfiltrates this data to a specified webhook. The code actively kills debugging processes, collects system hardware info, browser stored data, and Discord tokens by decrypting local database files. It sends detailed reports containing user credentials, tokens, browser passwords, cookies, history, and credit card info. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, token extraction routines, and the data exfiltration via webhook strongly indicate malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, without obfuscation, but performs malicious activities typical of information stealers and backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed for extensive information theft, including Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and network data. It exfiltrates this data to an attacker-controlled webhook, and kills processes associated with debugging or analysis tools to evade detection. Its behavior aligns with typical malware intended for system compromise, credential theft, and privacy invasion.",
