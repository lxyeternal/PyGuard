{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather system information, scrape browser data including saved passwords, cookies, browsing history, and credit cards, and extract Discord tokens from various applications and browser profiles. It then uploads this sensitive information to a specified Discord webhook, effectively functioning as a credential and data stealer.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from multiple sources including browser profile files, leveldb and sqlite databases, environment variables, network responses, and system commands to retrieve tokens, passwords, cookies, history, credit card info, system info, and network data.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected data via Discord webhooks, writes sensitive info into text files, zips and uploads them, and performs system modifications such as registry edits for persistence. Key sinks include the webhook.send() method, file writing operations, and registry modification commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as browser databases, environment variables, and network requests into data processing functions which decrypt or parse the data. Sensitive data like tokens, passwords, cookies, etc., then flow into the upload module, where they are formatted into Discord embeds and sent to external servers. System info and tokens are also captured and uploaded.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, extensive data collection from various browsers and system components, use of system commands for hardware info, decryption of stored passwords using system-specific keys, and compilation of sensitive personal and system data. It also deletes or overwrites files and registry entries for persistence or cleanup, and uses multiple techniques to exfiltrate user data silently. The use of obfuscation patterns like decoding encrypted tokens and decrypting data suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is structured into modules that perform malicious data collection: Anti-debugging measures and process checks aim to hide activity; browser modules extract stored passwords, cookies, history, and credit cards; Discord modules locate and decrypt tokens from local storage and profile databases, then validate and collect user info. The SystemInfo class gathers detailed system and network data. All collected data is assembled into Discord embeds and uploaded via webhook, often with embedded screenshots, and the files are zipped for transfer. The code's logic revolves around stealthy data exfiltration and persistence, with no apparent benign purpose. Hardcoded webhook URLs and extensive system/browser data harvesting strongly suggest malicious intent. The code operates covertly, decrypts encrypted data, and targets sensitive personal information, including login credentials, payment info, and Discord tokens.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential and data-stealing malware designed to extract sensitive user information from browsers, system, and Discord profiles, then exfiltrate it via webhooks. Its features such as token extraction, decryption routines, process and environment checks, and stealth techniques confirm malicious intent. It is highly dangerous and should not be used.",
