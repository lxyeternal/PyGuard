      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during package setup, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The behavior suggests potential for remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate. The package should be treated as malicious or compromised, and further decoding of the payload is recommended."
