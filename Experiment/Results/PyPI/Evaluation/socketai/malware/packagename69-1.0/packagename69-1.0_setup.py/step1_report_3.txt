{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to scrape, extract, and exfiltrate sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and files from various applications and browsers, then upload this data to a remote server or webhook.",
  "sources": "It reads input/data from browser storage (leveldb, SQLite databases), log files, environment variables, and user directories such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. It also reads files with specific keywords related to passwords, cookies, and sensitive info.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to a specified webhook URL, and files are uploaded to anonfiles and transfer.sh services. It also executes system commands like 'taskkill' and installs packages via subprocess, which could be used maliciously.",
  "flows": "The code extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, browser info, and file data, then immediately exfiltrates this information by making HTTP requests to remote URLs. It also collects user system info (IP address) and user data from Discord API, then sends this data to the webhook. Data flows from local storage/files into variables, then out to remote endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code includes: dynamic package installation, use of obfuscated or misleading variable names, extensive use of threading for concurrent data collection, and aggressive data exfiltration without user consent. The code also kills browser processes to access data, which is suspicious. Presence of hardcoded webhook URL and extensive data collection related to user credentials, cookies, and tokens indicate malicious intent. The code also attempts to access potentially sensitive browser and application files, then zips and uploads them.",
  "analysis": "The script performs multiple activities characteristic of malware: it installs dependencies automatically, accesses browser and application data for stored credentials and tokens, and exfiltrates data to a webhook. It also decrypts data such as stored passwords using master keys and Windows API functions, indicating it seeks to access protected data. The code includes functions to scan directories for files containing certain keywords, then uploads them anonymously, a typical data theft technique. The presence of hardcoded webhook and aggressive data collection methods further indicates malicious behavior. The code structure is complex, uses threading for parallel operations, and contains no user-facing features or legitimate functionality—consistent with malicious stealer malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly malicious, designed to steal sensitive user information including Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browser data, and files, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and anonymous file hosts. It uses Windows API calls for decryption, kills browser processes to access data, and installs dependencies dynamically, all typical of malware payloads. The overall security risk score is very high due to its comprehensive data theft capabilities.",
