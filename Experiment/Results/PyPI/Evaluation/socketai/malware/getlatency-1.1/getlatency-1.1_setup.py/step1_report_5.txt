  "flows": "Input data in setup() parameters (metadata) are used during package build and distribution; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected; the code is standard for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. No input reading from external sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious code or behaviors. All parameters are static strings, with no indication of malicious intent. No obfuscated or unusual syntax present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
