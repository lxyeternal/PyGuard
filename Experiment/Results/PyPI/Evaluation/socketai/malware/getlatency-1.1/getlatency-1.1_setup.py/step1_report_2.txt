{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'getlatency' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package information such as name, version, description, author, and author_email from the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code solely declares static metadata without data flow involving external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the standard 'setuptools' library to declare package metadata, a common and legitimate practice in Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The email address appears to be a standard contact address and not suspicious. The code is minimal, straightforward, and aligns with typical setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
