  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Code reads static string data for package metadata (name, version, description, author, email).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or inputs are used; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function with static metadata parameters. All data appears to be hardcoded static strings for package description, author, email, etc. There are no inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated segments. The code is a standard setup script with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious behavior detected. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
