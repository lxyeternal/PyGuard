  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'getlatency' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, which is used to package Python projects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no code execution or data handling occurs beyond package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward setup invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with static package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and email. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or suspicious behaviors. The package configuration appears standard and typical for a Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
