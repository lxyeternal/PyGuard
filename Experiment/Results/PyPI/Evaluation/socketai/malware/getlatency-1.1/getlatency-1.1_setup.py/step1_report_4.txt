  "purpose": "Define the package metadata for the 'getlatency' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static values assigned to setup() parameters; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external outputs are used or generated.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of setuptools for package setup with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata such as package name, version, description, author, and email. There are no dynamic or untrusted data inputs, no code execution, and no network activity. The code serves the standard purpose of package configuration. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
