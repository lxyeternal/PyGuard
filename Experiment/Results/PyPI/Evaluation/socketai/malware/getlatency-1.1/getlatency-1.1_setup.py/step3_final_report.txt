{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata defined in the setup() call (name, version, description, author, author_email). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines static metadata without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters, representing a typical package configuration. No dynamic code, input handling, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
