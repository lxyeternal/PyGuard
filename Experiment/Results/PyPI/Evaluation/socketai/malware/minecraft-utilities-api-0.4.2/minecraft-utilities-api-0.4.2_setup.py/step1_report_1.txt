  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'minecraft-utilities-api' Python library.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; data is static and defined in the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no data leakage or external effects present.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration with no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python library. It specifies package info and dependencies ('requests', 'pycryptodomex', 'pywin32'). There are no dynamic behaviors, no input handling, and no suspicious code patterns. Dependencies are common and benign in typical use cases. The script appears to be a straightforward, benign setup configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
