{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'minecraft-utilities-api', specifying its metadata and dependencies for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call: package name, version, description, packages list, and required dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data handling, user input, or untrusted data processing is present; no sinks for data leaks or malicious effects are identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all data appears statically defined within the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static parameters defining package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. All dependencies are common Python packages, and the code is straightforward. No source-to-sink data flows or anomalies suggest malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
