  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'minecraft-utilities-api'.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name, version, description, package list, and dependencies in the setup() function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Installation of external dependencies ('requests', 'pycryptodomex', 'pywin32') which could be exploited if malicious versions are injected, but this is standard for package dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow analysis needed as the code only declares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard setuptools setup format without obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with straightforward package metadata and dependencies. All fields are typical for a Python package distribution. No input or untrusted data handling, no execution of external or dynamic code, and no hidden or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely specifies package metadata and dependencies without any malicious intent.",
