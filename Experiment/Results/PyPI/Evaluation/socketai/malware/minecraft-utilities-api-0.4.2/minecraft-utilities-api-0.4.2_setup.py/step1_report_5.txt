  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'minecraft-utilities-api' Python library.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from hardcoded package metadata (name, version, description) and required dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The script defines package configuration but does not process external data flows or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly adheres to standard setup.py packaging conventions. No secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package name, version, description, and required libraries. All dependencies ('requests', 'pycryptodomex', 'pywin32') are common libraries, and no dynamic code execution, environment variables, or embedded secrets are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The script performs straightforward package setup without external input handling or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
