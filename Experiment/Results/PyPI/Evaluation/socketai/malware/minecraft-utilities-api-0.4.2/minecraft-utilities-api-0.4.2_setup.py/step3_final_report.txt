  "purpose": "A standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The import of setuptools and the call to setup() with static arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses common dependencies without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or suspicious constructs. Dependencies are standard packages. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are indicated. The code's static and straightforward nature confirms its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
