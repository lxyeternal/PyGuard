  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the 'minecraft-utilities-api' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name, version, description, list of packages included, and dependencies to install.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potentially dangerous actions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code is a static setup configuration with no data flow or runtime execution beyond package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of common setup tools and standard dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with typical package information and dependencies. It includes 'requests', 'pycryptodomex', and 'pywin32' as dependencies. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The dependencies are common in legitimate Python projects, although 'pywin32' is Windows-specific but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears legitimate and typical for a Python package distribution.",
