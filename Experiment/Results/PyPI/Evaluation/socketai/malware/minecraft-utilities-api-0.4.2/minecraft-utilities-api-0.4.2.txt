      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for credential theft and data exfiltration, with no benign purpose. It exfiltrates sensitive data via webhooks and messaging APIs, decrypts stored credentials, and accesses browser and system data. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs and placeholder tokens confirms malicious intent. The code is not obfuscated but performs stealthy data collection. Overall, it constitutes high-severity malware."
