{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the lack of comments or documentation, but it appears to be initializing some environment variables, importing modules, and setting up configurations, possibly for a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, imports modules, and possibly reads files or network data if present in hidden sections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include environment variable access, dynamic code execution, and network connections if implemented in hidden parts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or imported modules to internal variables or functions, potentially leading to system calls or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit anomalies detected due to lack of code details. The code structure appears standard; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected in the visible parts.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes environment variables, imports modules, and possibly configures runtime settings. Without further code, it is not possible to identify malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The structure appears typical for setup scripts. The absence of comments or unusual code patterns reduces suspicion. However, incomplete snippets prevent definitive conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard initialization routines. Due to lack of full context, confidence remains moderate, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
