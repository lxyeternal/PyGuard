  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, ensuring consistency and accuracy in scoring.",
  "sources": "Code initialization routines, environment variable access, module imports, configuration setups, utility functions, data processing segments.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution points, configuration reads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into configuration or processing functions; untrusted data could reach sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code observed; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or malicious indicators, with scores reflecting low risk and no obfuscation. Confidence levels are proportional to the detail provided. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation is not detected, and risk scores are low, indicating minimal concern. The assessments are internally consistent and justified by the descriptions. No adjustments are necessary given the current evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and align with the observed benign nature of the code snippets. The scoring is appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and low risk levels. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
