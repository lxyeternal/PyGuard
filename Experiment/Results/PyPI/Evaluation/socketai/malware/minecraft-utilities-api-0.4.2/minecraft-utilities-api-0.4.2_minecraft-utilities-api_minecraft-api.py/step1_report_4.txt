{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be designed for extracting and decrypting stored login credentials, cookies, and tokens from various browsers and applications, then exfiltrating this data via webhook or Telegram.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for paths; reads Local State files, Login Data databases, cookie databases, and LevelDB logs for stored credentials, tokens, cookies, and other sensitive data.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data through Telegram and Discord webhooks; writes data into text files; copies and reads browser database files; decrypts data using Windows cryptographic functions.",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens and credentials from browser and application storage (sources), decrypts them with Windows API and AES, then writes data into files and exfiltrates via network (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL and placeholder Telegram token; use of win32crypt and Cryptodome for decrypting browser data; obfuscated regex patterns; file deletion after exfiltration; collection of tokens and passwords from multiple browsers; no clear user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to harvest stored browser credentials, cookies, and tokens, decrypts them using Windows cryptography, and exfiltrates the data via webhooks and Telegram. It collects sensitive data from popular browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, and Yandex. The script uses standard techniques for credential extraction but includes malicious indicators such as hardcoded exfiltration endpoints, collection of potentially sensitive data without user consent, and obfuscation of regex patterns. The use of the win32crypt and Cryptodome libraries for decryption is typical for such tasks, and the code appears to operate stealthily by copying database files temporarily and deleting them afterward. The presence of hardcoded webhook and placeholder Telegram token suggests it is intended for unauthorized data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a credential and token stealer targeting browsers and applications, exfiltrating sensitive information to external endpoints. Its structure and techniques align with malicious data harvesting scripts. The hardcoded exfiltration URLs and tokens strongly indicate malicious intent, with no legitimate user-facing functionality. It should be considered malicious and dangerous for deployment.",
