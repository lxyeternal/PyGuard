  ],
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information such as hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes this data in base64, then splits and encodes it further into hex strings. The data is transmitted covertly via DNS by pinging specially crafted domain names that embed the data. It also sends the same data over HTTP using various libraries and endpoints. The obfuscation of data and use of DNS queries for transmission are typical indicators of data exfiltration or covert communication. The multiple network request methods and obfuscated encoding suggest an intent to evade detection, aligning with malicious data theft behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to covertly collect and exfiltrate system information using DNS tunneling and HTTP requests. The obfuscation techniques and network traffic patterns strongly indicate malicious intent related to data theft or system reconnaissance. The overall risk level is high, and the package should not be used.",
