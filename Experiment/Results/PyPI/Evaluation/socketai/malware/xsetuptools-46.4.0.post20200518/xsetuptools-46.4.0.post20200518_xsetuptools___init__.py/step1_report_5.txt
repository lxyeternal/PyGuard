{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, encodes it, and sends it covertly via DNS queries and HTTP requests, likely for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (os.uname() or environment variable), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and package name.",
  "sinks": "os.system('ping ...') commands for DNS-based data transmission; urllib and requests HTTP requests for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System info → Base64 encode → Chunked hex encoding → Embedding in domain names and HTTP parameters → Data sent via ping commands and HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "Encoding data into domain names and making repeated ping calls to domains constructed from encoded data, which is unusual and suspicious; multiple fallback attempts for network calls; obfuscation of data within DNS queries and HTTP parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific data (hostname, username, execution path, package info), encodes it with base64, then splits and encodes it into hexadecimal strings. It constructs domain names embedding this encoded data, then issues DNS 'ping' commands to these domains, likely to exfiltrate data covertly through DNS queries. Additionally, it performs HTTP POST and GET requests with the encoded data, further indicating covert data transmission. The use of multiple methods and encoding techniques suggests an attempt to evade detection. The code does not perform any obvious malicious system modifications or damaging operations, but it is designed to secretly transmit system info to an external server, which is characteristic of data exfiltration malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as it covertly encodes and transmits system information via DNS and HTTP channels. This behavior aligns with data exfiltration or command-and-control communication mechanisms used by malware.",
