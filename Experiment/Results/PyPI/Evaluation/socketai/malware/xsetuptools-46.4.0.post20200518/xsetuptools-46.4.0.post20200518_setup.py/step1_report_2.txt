{
  "purpose": "To configure the packaging of a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools and calls setup() with package information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code is standard packaging configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations; setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears minimal and standard for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions from a well-known packaging library and calls setup() with a fixed package name and version, along with dynamically finding packages. No external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data are involved. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code performs a typical package configuration task. It does not include any code that could be malicious or pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata and automatically discovers packages to include.",
