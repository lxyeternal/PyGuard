  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic inputs or malicious code.",
  "sources": "Static string literals for package name and version, find_packages() function discovering packages.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'xsetuptools' which could be intended for obfuscation or misdirection, but no actual malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward setup script importing from setuptools and calling setup() with fixed parameters. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The package name 'xsetuptools' is somewhat unusual but not malicious. All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (0 or 0.1), justified by the package name anomaly. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The slight concern over the package name does not translate into actual risk. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
