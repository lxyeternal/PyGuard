      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, system API calls, privilege escalation checks, and dynamic execution, all indicative of malicious intent. The heavy obfuscation and system modifications justify a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation score of 1.0, and security risk score of 1.0. It should be classified as malicious, representing a severe security threat. The legitimate-looking setup code at the end appears to be a facade, but the preceding code's behavior confirms malicious activity. It is strongly recommended to treat this dependency as malicious and avoid its use or distribution."

      "conclusion": "The code is assessed as benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores are justified at 0.0. The overall assessment indicates a safe dependency, with scores aligned to the descriptions. No adjustments are necessary based on the provided summaries."
