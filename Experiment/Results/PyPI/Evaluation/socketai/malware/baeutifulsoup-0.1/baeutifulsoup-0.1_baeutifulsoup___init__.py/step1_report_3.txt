{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script that performs basic operations such as printing messages and possibly handling input.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., 'input()') or environment variable reads if present",
  "sinks": "Print statements, network connections, file writes, or system calls",
  "flows": "Data read from input or environment variables passing through processing functions to outputs or network",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code detected; the code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard input/output operations, with no evident use of malicious functions or obfuscated constructs. No network activity or file system manipulations indicative of malicious intent. The structure is simple, with no suspicious logic or secret backdoors. Since no external dependencies or network activity are observed, the risk of malicious behavior is minimal. The code does not perform any dangerous operations like executing system commands or accessing sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility script with no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities detected.",
