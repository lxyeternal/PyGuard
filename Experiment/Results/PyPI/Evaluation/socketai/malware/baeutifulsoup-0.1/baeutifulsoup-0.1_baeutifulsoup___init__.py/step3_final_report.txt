  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code summaries.",
  "sources": "Descriptions of code behavior, input sources such as environment variables, user inputs, internal data handling, and external data flows if mentioned.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file operations, or other outputs where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), including any suspicious or anomalous data handling or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "Any unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors noted in summaries, such as external data access, obfuscated code, or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "All five reports consistently describe benign, straightforward code with no external inputs/outputs, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation. Malware scores are uniformly zero, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are set at 0.2, reflecting low but cautious risk levels, justified given the limited context. Confidence levels are high (0.9) in most reports, supporting the benign assessment. The descriptions lack evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Given the absence of actual code snippets, the evaluations rely on summaries, but the reasoning appears sound and consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is assessed as benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores are justified at 0.0. The overall assessment indicates a safe dependency, with scores aligned to the descriptions. No adjustments are necessary based on the provided summaries.",
