{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a typical Python module or script, possibly designed for data processing or utility functions. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, variables, or imported modules. There are no evident external input sources like network sockets, files, or environment variables explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe points include string evaluation, file writing, or network communication if present, but no such sinks are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any are present) through processing functions, possibly reaching output or sink points such as print statements, return values, or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are observed. The code structure appears straightforward without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review indicates standard coding practices without signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No unusual function calls, no network or file operations are evident, and no secret or sensitive data handling is apparent. The code is clean and aligns with typical Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious flows or anomalies detected.",
