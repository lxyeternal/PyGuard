  "conclusion": "The script contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, with an embedded URL indicating potential malicious activity. The broad exception handling and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend treating this package as malicious until payload decoding confirms otherwise."
