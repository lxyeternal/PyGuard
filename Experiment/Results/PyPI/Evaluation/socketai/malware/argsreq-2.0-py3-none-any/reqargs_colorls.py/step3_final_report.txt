{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote executable from a hardcoded URL and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent. It also contains unrelated plotting functions and filesystem operations that appear to be distractors or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Network request to 'https://api.dreamyoak.xyz/cdn/file.exe' via requests.get, writing to a temporary file, and subprocess.call() executing the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.call() executing the downloaded file, writing response content to disk.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote payload -> file.write() saves payload locally -> subprocess.call() executes payload.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded suspicious URL, execution of untrusted code without validation, Unicode characters in variable names, silent error handling, unrelated plotting functions present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a network request to a suspicious URL, writes the response to a temporary file, and executes it directly without any validation or sandboxing, which is a classic malicious pattern. The presence of Unicode obfuscation and unrelated plotting functions serve as potential distractors or obfuscation techniques. The silent exception handling could hide malicious failures. The core activity of remote code execution confirms malicious intent with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The script is unequivocally malicious, exhibiting high severity due to untrusted remote code execution. Obfuscation is moderate, primarily via Unicode characters. The overall security risk is maximal. The malware score should be set to 1, the obfuscation score around 0.7, and the security risk score at 1.",
