{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a suspicious URL, writes it to a temporary directory, and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://api.dreamyoak.xyz/cdn/file.exe' via requests.get(), reading the response content, and the subprocess.call() executing the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Writing the downloaded binary to disk and executing it with subprocess.call(), which can lead to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the external executable -> file.write() saves it to disk -> subprocess.call() executes the malicious file.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, Unicode characters in variable names, suppressed error handling, inclusion of benign plotting functions alongside malicious code, and use of a suspicious external URL.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a clear malicious pattern: it downloads a remote executable from an untrusted source and runs it without validation, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The presence of obfuscated variable names and Unicode characters indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The benign functions for plotting mathematical functions are likely distractors or code obfuscation. Error handling is broad and suppresses failures, further hiding malicious activity. The external URL points to a Windows executable, and executing it without validation poses a high security risk. The core malicious activity is confirmed, and the obfuscation tactics increase the difficulty of detection. Overall, the code exhibits high malicious potential and should be classified as malware with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior through remote code download and execution, employs obfuscation to hide intent, and poses a high security risk. The benign functions are distractions. The malware score is set to 1, the obfuscation score to 0.8, and the security risk to 1, aligning with the evidence.",
