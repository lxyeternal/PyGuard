{
  "purpose": "This module defines a set of URL endpoints used by the SentinelOne management system for various API interactions.",
  "sources": "Static string definitions representing API endpoint paths; no input reading or data processing occurs within these definitions.",
  "sinks": "These URLs are used as API endpoints for network requests, potentially transmitting or receiving data. No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling is evident in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is a static collection of constants without dynamic data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. All definitions are straightforward string constants representing API routes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constants defining various API endpoints used throughout the SentinelOne management platform. No user input handling, no data processing, and no network communication code are included here. All endpoint strings are static and appear to be well-structured, following RESTful conventions. The definitions cover a broad range of functionalities, including threats, agents, tags, firewall control, rogues, star alerts, marketplace, remote scripts, ranger, application management, threat intelligence, asset inventory, and threat actions. There are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code appears to serve as a centralized reference for API paths, typical for API client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious intent within this code segment. It is a straightforward collection of API endpoint constants used for legitimate management functions. No security risks or malware are evident based solely on this static content.",
