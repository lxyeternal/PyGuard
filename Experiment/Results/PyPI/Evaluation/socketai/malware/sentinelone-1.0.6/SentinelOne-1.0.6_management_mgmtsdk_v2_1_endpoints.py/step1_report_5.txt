  "purpose": "This code defines URL endpoint constants for interacting with various SentinelOne management features and services.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for API endpoint paths throughout the module.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involving untrusted data handling or external input processing.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flows are evident; all endpoint strings are static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code solely declares API endpoint strings. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a centralized declaration of API endpoint paths used in the SentinelOne management system. All entries are static string constants, with some formatted strings for endpoints requiring parameters. No user input handling, no data processing logic, no network calls, nor any code injection mechanisms are included. The structure is straightforward, purely defining constant strings for internal use. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of API endpoint constants intended for use in the SentinelOne management SDK or application. It contains no malicious or suspicious logic, no obfuscated code, and no signs of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is negligible.",
