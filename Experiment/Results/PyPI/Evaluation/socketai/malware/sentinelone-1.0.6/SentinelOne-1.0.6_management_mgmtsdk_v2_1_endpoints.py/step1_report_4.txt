  "purpose": "Defines URL endpoints for SentinelOne management API, covering threats, agents, tags, firewall, ranger, application management, threat intelligence, and upgrade policies.",
  "sources": "Constants defining API endpoint strings, used as URL paths in API calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to injection if these endpoint strings are used directly in API requests without validation, but by themselves they do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or user-input driven URL generation is present; all endpoints are static string constants. Therefore, there are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. All entries are straightforward string constants defining API routes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic execution or complex logic.",
  "analysis": "This code solely defines static constants for API endpoint paths. These constants are used elsewhere in the application for API requests. There are no dynamic or user-controlled elements that could lead to malicious behavior. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. It is purely configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration of API endpoints. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are present within these definitions. They are straightforward URL path constants used in legitimate API interactions.",
