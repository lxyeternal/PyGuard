  "purpose": "Defines API URL paths for SentinelOne management endpoints.",
  "sources": "Static string constants representing API endpoint paths.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input or output handling within this code.",
  "flows": "None; purely static URL definitions without dynamic URL generation or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no obfuscation, no embedded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants used as API route templates. There is no dynamic code, user input handling, or data processing. The endpoints cover management functions but are straightforward URL strings. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is configuration/reference for API calls, not executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static collection of API endpoint constants with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
