{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of URL endpoints for a security management system, enabling communication with various modules such as threats, agents, firewall control, ranger, threat intelligence, and more.",
  "sources": "The code primarily consists of string constants assigned to endpoint URL paths. No external input or data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The endpoint URL strings are potential sinks if they are used to send or receive untrusted data. However, in this context, they are static definitions, not dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; these are static constant definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated strings, or hidden behaviors, is present. The code is straightforward constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constants representing API endpoint paths used within a larger security management system. There are no input handling, data processing, or code execution mechanisms here. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code snippets are evident. All endpoint strings appear appropriate for their documented purposes. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. Its structure is simple, static, and intended for defining API routes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely a static configuration of API endpoint constants for a security management system. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected within this code snippet.",
