  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as static URL endpoint definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data transmission or dynamic logic; purely constants.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, serving as a reference for API routes, with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear, readable strings) — justified.  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk identified) — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; static endpoint definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic URL generation or untrusted input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static constants, used for legitimate API interactions.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0 — no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the static nature of the definitions.\n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- No dynamic or user-controlled URL components.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Reinforces that these are static URL constants with no dynamic or untrusted data involved.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- No embedded secrets or malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with prior assessments; static string constants.\n- No dynamic URL generation or data processing.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a static collection of API endpoint definitions with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are consistent and reasonable.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks evident from static endpoint definitions.\n\n**Note:** Since these are just constants, the security implications depend on how they are used elsewhere. However, based solely on this static code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free from obfuscation or malware. The scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
