The environment variable reliance is typical and does not introduce significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score of 0.1 justified by potential misconfiguration but not malicious behavior."

The risk scores of 0.2 are acceptable but could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for more precision, considering the limited code. Overall, the reports are appropriately cautious, and no adjustments are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK extension for SentinelOne management, with no evidence of malicious activity. The only potential risk stems from the 'api.run()' call during initialization, which should be verified to ensure it does not perform unintended actions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to the side effects of 'api.run()'."
