{
  "purpose": "Define classes and methods to construct and validate query filters for an API, supporting different scope filters and operators.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods, apply methods, get_query_params static method, and __init__ methods of classes; uses data from input parameters such as filter arguments and query filter objects.",
  "sinks": "The apply method writes to self.filters; get_query_params returns filter dictionaries; potential injection points if filter values are not sanitized (though no explicit unsafe code is evident).",
  "flows": "Input filter arguments and query filter objects flow through apply and get_query_params, which populate the self.filters dictionary with transformed keys and values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code does not perform network access, system modification, or data exfiltration. Use of exceptions for control flow appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs query filter objects with validation and transformation methods. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious external calls are present. The only potential concern is the dynamic construction of filter keys, but it is part of legitimate query-building logic. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard query filter implementation with proper exception handling and validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical query filter helper for API interactions, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely manages query parameters with validation and transformation, adhering to standard patterns.",
