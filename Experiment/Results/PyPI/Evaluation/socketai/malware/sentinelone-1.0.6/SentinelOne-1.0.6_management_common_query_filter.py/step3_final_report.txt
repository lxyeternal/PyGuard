  "purpose": "Defines classes and methods for constructing, validating, and transforming API query filters with scope-specific subclasses.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, input strings, method parameters, and class constants used in validation and transformation.",
  "sinks": "Internal filter dictionaries used for API calls; no external data sinks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input strings are split and processed through 'apply' and 'get_query_params' methods into filter dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or external calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard validation, string transformation, and class inheritance to manage query filters. No external code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The dynamic extension of 'QUERY_ARGS' with suffixes is typical for query parameter handling. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are evident. The validation focuses on keys and operators, not on filter values, which mitigates injection risks within this scope.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of API query filter management with proper validation and transformation. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The low security risk score (0) is appropriate given its functionality.",
