{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for constructing, transforming, and validating query filters for an API, supporting various scope filters and operator handling.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include filter arguments passed as keyword arguments to 'get_query_params' and split strings from query parameters processed by 'SplittedHelper'.",
  "sinks": "The filters are assembled into a dictionary used in API calls; no direct data sinks like file writing, network transmission, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (filter args or query filter objects) are processed through 'get_query_params' -> 'apply' method of 'QueryFilter' subclasses -> filter.transform -> resulting in filter dictionaries used for API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code uses standard class structures and exception handling without obfuscation or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for managing query filters with validation and transformation logic. It imports exceptions from a management SDK but does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The 'apply' method enforces filter rules, and 'transform' creates API-compatible keys. The filter classes are straightforward and designed for safe query parameter handling. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of query filter handling with validation and transformation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be purely for safe construction of API query parameters.",
