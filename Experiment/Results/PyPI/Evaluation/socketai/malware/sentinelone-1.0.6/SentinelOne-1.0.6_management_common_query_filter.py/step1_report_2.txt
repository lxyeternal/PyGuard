{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of classes for building, applying, and transforming query filters for an API, with subclasses specifying different filter scopes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, method parameters, and internal attribute values. No external data sources or input streams are accessed.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are evident; the code constructs filter dictionaries that are likely used elsewhere in API calls. No untrusted data is sent to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data (filter arguments) flows through 'apply' and 'get_query_params' methods, transforming filter criteria into query parameter dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns. Exception handling for invalid arguments is present but benign. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements filter construction logic with validation, transformation, and management of query parameters. It uses standard class inheritance, exception handling, and string manipulations. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or external data handling occurs. The logic appears straightforward and intended for safe query parameter management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code does not process or expose sensitive data outside its scope, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, standard implementation of query filter handling with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
