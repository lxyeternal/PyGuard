{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and constants for constructing and validating query filters for an API, supporting various operators and scope filters.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via method parameters such as 'key', 'val', 'op' in 'apply', 'filter_args' in 'get_query_params', and initialization parameters for helper classes.",
  "sinks": "Filters are stored internally in 'self.filters'; the 'apply' method manipulates these filters. No direct data sinks like file or network output are present, but the filter data could potentially influence API calls or database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('key', 'val', 'op', 'filter_args') through 'apply' and 'get_query_params' methods into internal filter dictionaries; these can be used downstream in API requests or database queries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors, are present. The code primarily deals with filter validation and transformation. The only minor concern is the dynamic extension of 'QUERY_ARGS' with 's' or 'es' suffixes, but this appears to be standard filter setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of filter handling for an API, involving classes for different filter scopes and helper methods for parsing filter arguments. The 'apply' method validates filter keys and operators against predefined allowed values, raising exceptions on invalid inputs. The 'get_query_params' method creates filter dictionaries from either object or kwargs inputs, ensuring mutual exclusivity. No use of external or unsafe functions, nor data exfiltration or code injection mechanisms are present. Overall, the code's structure and logic are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of API filter management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily facilitates safe filter construction with validation checks. Overall, the code is safe, with a low malware and security risk score.",
