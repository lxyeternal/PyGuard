  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but without seeing the actual code, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions (like input(), sys.stdin), environment variables, or data read from files or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, file writes, or database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks potentially through variables, function calls, or data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without code; look for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs if present.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the actual code, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Normally, I would identify input points, vulnerable processing, and data output paths. I would also check for obfuscation or suspicious behaviors like network connections or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient code provided for a thorough analysis. Cannot determine malicious intent or security risks without examining the actual source code.",
