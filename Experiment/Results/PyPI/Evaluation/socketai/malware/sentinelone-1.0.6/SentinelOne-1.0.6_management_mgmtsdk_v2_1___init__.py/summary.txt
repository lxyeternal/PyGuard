  "conclusion": "The provided assessments are accurate and consistent. Given the lack of evidence for malicious activity or obfuscation, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The risk scores of 0.2 are acceptable but could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for more precision, considering the limited code. Overall, the reports are appropriately cautious, and no adjustments are necessary."
