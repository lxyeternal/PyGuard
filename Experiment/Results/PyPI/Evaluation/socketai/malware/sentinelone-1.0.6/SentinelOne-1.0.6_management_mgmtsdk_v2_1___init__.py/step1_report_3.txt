{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a typical Python application, with no immediately obvious malicious intent. It performs standard operations such as importing modules, defining functions, and executing main logic.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, file inputs, or user input (if present), but specific source points are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include output to logs or network communications, but no explicit sinks such as network connections, subprocess calls, or file writes are clearly identifiable as untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are demonstrated in the code snippet. Without concrete source or sink points, detailed flow analysis cannot be performed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures are evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. The code uses standard language features and typical library calls.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is straightforward and aligns with normal Python application patterns. It imports modules, defines functions, and runs main logic without any signs of malicious behavior. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or suspicious network activity are apparent. Since the code appears standard and lacks any suspicious constructs, the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit any signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign Python script with typical operations. The security risk is minimal, and no anomalies are detected.",
