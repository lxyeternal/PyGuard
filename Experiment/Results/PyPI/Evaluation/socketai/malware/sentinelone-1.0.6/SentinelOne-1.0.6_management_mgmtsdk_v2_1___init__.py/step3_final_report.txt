  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network calls, file operations, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential malicious data exfiltration or control flow anomalies.",
  "anomalies": "Any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with no suspicious patterns or malicious activity. Malware scores are consistently zero, matching the absence of evidence. Confidence levels are appropriate, with low scores reflecting limited information. Risk scores are mostly 0.2, slightly cautious but reasonable given the context. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The reasoning aligns with the scores, and the conservative approach is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided assessments are accurate and consistent. Given the lack of evidence for malicious activity or obfuscation, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The risk scores of 0.2 are acceptable but could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for more precision, considering the limited code. Overall, the reports are appropriately cautious, and no adjustments are necessary.",
