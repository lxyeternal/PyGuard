  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the 'MgmtSdk' logger, including setting log file paths and log levels based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system and standard library functions for file and environment access.",
  "sinks": "Writing logs to a file specified by 'SDK_LOG_PATH' or default path; outputting logs to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log path and level; log handlers write data from application logs to file and stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuring log paths and levels is typical; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed; no external network activity, backdoors, or malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging configuration with handlers writing to a file and stdout, with file path and log level determined by environment variables. The log path defaults to a temporary directory, with environment variables allowing override. No data leakage or malicious actions are evident. The logic is straightforward and aligned with standard logging practices. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup without malicious intent or security risks. It relies on environment variables for configuration, which is common practice, but does not introduce security concerns or malicious behavior.",
