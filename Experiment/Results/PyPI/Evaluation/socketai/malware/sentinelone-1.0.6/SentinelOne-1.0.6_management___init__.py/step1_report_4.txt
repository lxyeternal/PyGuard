  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the SDK, including log file and stdout handlers, with configurable log level and log path.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform information; temporary directory path.",
  "sinks": "Log data written to specified file path; log output to stdout.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and path; handlers write logs to file and stdout based on configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None notable; standard logging configuration. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. The code dynamically uses environment variables without validation, but this is typical for configuration. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers that write logs to a file and stdout, with configurable log level and log file path via environment variables. It uses standard libraries, proper formatting, and platform-aware temporary directory selection. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables without validation, which is common in configuration code but does not pose a security risk per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging setup for an SDK, with no malicious intent or malicious code detected. It is a typical configuration script, and no security threats or malware are present.",
