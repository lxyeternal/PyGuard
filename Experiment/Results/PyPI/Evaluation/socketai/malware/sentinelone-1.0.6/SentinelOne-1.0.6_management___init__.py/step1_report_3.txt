  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for a management SDK, setting log levels and output destinations based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' for log configuration; filesystem for log file path.",
  "sinks": "Log data written to files and stdout; no untrusted data input or data exfiltration points evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log configuration; log handlers write to disk or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Use of environment variables is standard for configurable logging.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers based on environment variables, including dynamic log file path and level. It uses standard logging practices, with no signs of malicious behavior. No untrusted data flows into security-sensitive sinks or vice versa. No obfuscated or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with configurable parameters via environment variables. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
