  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for a management SDK, setting up log file and console output with configurable log level and path.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform; tempfile.gettempdir()",
  "sinks": "Log file at specified or default path; stdout for logs",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and path, which are used in file and stream handlers",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded credentials, no unusual code behavior, no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging handlers based on environment variables and system platform. It dynamically determines log file path and level, and adds handlers accordingly. No suspicious or malicious activity, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The code is straightforward and intended for standard logging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging setup with configurable environment variables. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It appears to be a typical utility for logging configuration.",
