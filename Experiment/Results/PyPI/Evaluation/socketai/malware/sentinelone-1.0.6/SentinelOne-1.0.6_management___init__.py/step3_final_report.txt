  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the 'MgmtSdk' logger, setting log file path and level based on environment variables or defaults.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS'; system platform detection; tempfile module for default directory.",
  "sinks": "FileHandler and StreamHandler write logs to file and stdout respectively; environment variables influence log path and level.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level and path; handlers output logs to file and stdout; no external network or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables without validation; reliance on system platform detection for temp directory; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging setup that uses environment variables for configuration, with platform-aware temp directory selection. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The environment variables could be misconfigured, but this is a common practice and not malicious. The code's clarity and standard pattern indicate benign intent. The minimal security risk score (0.1) reflects the potential for misconfiguration but does not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration snippet with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The environment variable reliance is typical and does not introduce significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score of 0.1 justified by potential misconfiguration but not malicious behavior.",
