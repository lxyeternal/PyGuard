  "purpose": "Configure logging handlers for the MgmtSdk, setting log level and log file path based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'SDK_LOG_PATH', 'SDK_LOG_LEVEL', and 'SDK_LOG_DEFAULT_HANDLERS' which influence log configuration.",
  "sinks": "Log file path determined by environment variable, potentially writable locations; no external data sinks are directly used.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read to determine log level and file path; these values are used to configure logging handlers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to set log paths and levels is typical; no hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; no suspicious code flows or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to set up logging handlers with specified log files and levels, defaulting to temp directory on macOS and other OS. No untrusted data processing, no external network connections, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The code follows standard logging setup patterns and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with environment-driven configuration. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It simply manages logging configuration based on environment variables.",
