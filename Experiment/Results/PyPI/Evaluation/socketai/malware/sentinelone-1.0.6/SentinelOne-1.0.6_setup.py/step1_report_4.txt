  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'SentinelOne' with specific version and license information.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata; no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'license' field with the package author string 'SentinelOne', which is unusual as license is typically a license type, not a name. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools, defines a version string, and calls setup with name, version, and license parameters. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The license field is non-standard but not malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python module named 'SentinelOne'. No malicious or suspicious activity detected based on this snippet.",
