  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package name, version, and license from the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only sets static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'license' field with a non-standard license string; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines a version variable, and calls setup() with package metadata. The code is minimal and straightforward, solely defining static package info. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted inputs, and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The 'license' field value is non-standard but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package setup script that contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It only specifies static package metadata with no suspicious or harmful code present.",
