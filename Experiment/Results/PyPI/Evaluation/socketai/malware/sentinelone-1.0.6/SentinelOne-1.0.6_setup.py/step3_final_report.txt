  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution",
  "sources": "Static assignment within setup() call, no external input or dynamic code",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; static data assigned directly in setup()",
  "anomalies": "License field set to 'SentinelOne', which is non-standard but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script importing setuptools, defining a version variable, and calling setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code, external inputs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The only unusual aspect is the license string, which does not pose a security threat. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The minor anomaly in the license field does not justify a higher security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "This package setup script is benign, static, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The license string anomaly is not a security concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 for consistency.",
