  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution of the SentinelOne Python package.",
  "sources": "Constants setting package version and name, and the setup() function which reads these constants.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function processing package information; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Constants are used directly in setup() without external input; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions, defines a package version, and calls setup() with minimal metadata. No external input, no suspicious code, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated elements. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
