  "purpose": "Manage authentication headers, cookies, and tokens for HTTP requests within an application.",
  "sources": "Initialization of headers, cookies, and token variables in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, these variables could be used in network requests that might be vulnerable if misused, but no explicit sinks are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "The code sets up internal state variables that could be used downstream to send authenticated requests, but no data flow occurs within this fragment itself.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears standard for managing auth state.",
  "analysis": "The class constructor initializes three instance variables: headers with a JSON content type, an empty cookies dictionary, and a token set to None. There are no input sources or data manipulations, and no network interactions or suspicious behaviors are evident in this fragment. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a basic class setup for managing authentication data in a larger application. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks on its own.",
