  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; static initialization only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward attribute setup with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an __init__ method that sets up headers, cookies, and token with default values. No external inputs, network calls, or data processing are present. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are consistent with the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard class constructor with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The existing reports accurately reflect its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
