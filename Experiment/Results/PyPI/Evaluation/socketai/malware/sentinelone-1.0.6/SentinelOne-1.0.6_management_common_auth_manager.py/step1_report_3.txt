{
  "purpose": "Defines an authentication management class that handles headers, cookies, and tokens for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The constructor initializes headers, cookies, and token variables; no external input is read in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable as the code only initializes variables without processing or transferring data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior; it appears standard for an auth class initialization.",
  "analysis": "The class constructor sets up default headers for content type as JSON, initializes an empty cookie store, and sets token to None. There are no external data reads, no sensitive data handling, no network calls, and no obfuscated code. The code is minimal and appears to be a simple setup without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic class setup for authentication management with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies detected. It is a typical initialization code snippet for handling auth tokens and headers.",
