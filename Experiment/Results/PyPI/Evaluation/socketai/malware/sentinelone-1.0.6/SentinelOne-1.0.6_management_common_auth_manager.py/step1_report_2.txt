  "purpose": "Initialize an authentication manager with default headers, cookies, and token state",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading observed in the provided code)",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data processing observed)",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified in the snippet",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual functionality; only class constructor with default attribute setup, no suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'AuthManager' with an __init__ method that sets up headers, cookies, and token attributes. No external inputs, no data processing, or security-sensitive operations are performed. The class appears to be a standard setup for managing authentication state, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The code is minimal and standard in structure, with no obfuscated patterns or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class constructor with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not read external data, perform unsafe operations, or include suspicious behavior. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
