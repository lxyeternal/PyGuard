{
  "purpose": "The class appears to manage authentication details, including headers, cookies, and tokens, likely for HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data for headers, cookies, and initializes token as None.",
  "sinks": "No external data or untrusted input sources are evident; no sinks for data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization sets static headers and empty cookies, with token set to None; no data flows from input to output or sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple AuthManager class with an __init__ method that initializes headers with a static content-type, an empty cookies dictionary, and a None token. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data sources, and no functions or methods that process untrusted data or perform network actions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup for managing authentication data with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard component of an authentication mechanism without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
