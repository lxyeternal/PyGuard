  "sources": "Initialization of headers, cookies, and token variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially where the token or cookies are used in HTTP requests, but not shown here.",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly shown; only variable initialization occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The class simply initializes authentication-related data structures with default values. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no sinks or data transmission in the provided snippet. The code appears to be a standard setup for an authentication manager, with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class constructor initializing authentication data containers. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident based on this snippet.",
