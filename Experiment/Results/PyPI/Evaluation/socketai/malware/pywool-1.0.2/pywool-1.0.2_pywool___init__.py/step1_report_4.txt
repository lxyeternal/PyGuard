  "purpose": "Constructor method (__init__) with no implementation, likely part of a class definition.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since there are no operations or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Empty constructor method; no behavior or logic present; nothing unusual or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __init__ method, which is typically used as a class initializer in Python. It contains no implementation or data handling, and no other code is present. There are no inputs, outputs, or logic that could pose security risks or malicious behavior. Given the minimal and standard structure, there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, empty class constructor with no malicious or security concerns. It appears benign and serves as a placeholder or part of a larger class definition.",
