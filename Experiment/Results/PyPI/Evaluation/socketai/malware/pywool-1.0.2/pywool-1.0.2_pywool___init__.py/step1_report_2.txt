  "purpose": "Constructor method for a class, currently does nothing.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the method is empty.",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method is defined without 'self' parameter, which is syntactically incorrect in Python and suggests an incomplete or malformed code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function named __init__() without including 'self' as the first parameter, which is required for class instance methods in Python. This indicates either an incomplete implementation or a mistake. No data input, output, or processing occurs. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior, but the code is syntactically invalid as it stands. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an incomplete or incorrect class constructor definition with no malicious content. It does not pose security risks but is syntactically invalid and likely non-functional in its current form.",
