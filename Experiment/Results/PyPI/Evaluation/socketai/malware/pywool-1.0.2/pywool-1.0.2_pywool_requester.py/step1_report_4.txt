  "purpose": "Placeholder class definition with no functionality or behavior.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the class contains no methods or attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Class is defined but contains no implementation, methods, or attributes; could be a placeholder or incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty class named 'send' with no methods, attributes, or code logic. It does not perform any actions, data handling, or interactions. There is no suspicious or malicious activity apparent. The class appears to be a stub or placeholder, which is common in initial code scaffolding. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple, empty class definition with no behavior. It does not contain any malicious intent or security issues. It is likely part of a larger codebase or a stub for future implementation.",
