{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration and includes a custom installation command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated code block within the CustomInstallCommand.run() method reads no external input but contains hardcoded encoded strings used in decoding and executing dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) statement executes decoded code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially malicious if the decoded content is harmful.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded obfuscated string is decoded via XOR operation and then dynamically executed with eval(compile()), creating a source-to-sink flow from the encoded string to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated code that decodes and executes code at runtime; the use of eval() with dynamically decoded data is suspicious and a common indicator of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup script for a Python package, but within the CustomInstallCommand class, it contains an obfuscated code segment. This segment decodes a long, hardcoded string using an XOR cipher with a secondary key string. The decoded result is then executed using eval(compile()), which is a significant security risk as it allows arbitrary code execution during installation. Such behavior is typical of malicious or backdoor code designed to hide malicious payloads within ostensibly legitimate package installation routines. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no other suspicious activity. The obfuscation and the runtime code execution strongly suggest malicious intent or at least malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed code during package installation, which poses a high security risk. This behavior indicates likely malicious intent, such as a backdoor or malware. The presence of eval() with decoded data is a critical security concern.",
