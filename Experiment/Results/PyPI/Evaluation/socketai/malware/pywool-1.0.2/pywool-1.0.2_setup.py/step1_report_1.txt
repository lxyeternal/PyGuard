{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'pywool', including a custom installation command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string wopvEaTEcopFEavc and the associated decoding process.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) statement which executes dynamically decoded code during installation.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated code is decoded via XOR with a numeric string, then compiled and executed with eval, representing a source-to-sink flow that leads to potentially malicious code execution during install.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated code that decodes and executes code at runtime. Use of eval(compile()) on dynamically decoded data is suspicious, especially within a setup script. The decoded string is not human-readable, indicating intent to hide malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools and defines a custom install command. Inside the custom run method, it contains a long obfuscated string and a numeric string used as a key for XOR decryption. The decoded string is then executed via eval(compile()), which can run arbitrary code. This pattern is typical of malicious supply chain behavior, aiming to execute hidden malicious code during package installation. The rest of the setup code appears normal, but the critical malicious component is the runtime decoding and execution of obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior in the form of obfuscated code that executes during installation, likely to run hidden malicious code. This code is designed to evade static detection and execute arbitrary code at install time, representing a high security risk.",
