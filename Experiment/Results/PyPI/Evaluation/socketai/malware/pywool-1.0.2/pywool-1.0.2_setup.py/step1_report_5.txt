{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that includes an obfuscated and encoded dynamic code execution during installation.",
  "sources": "The obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the encoded string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp' are the primary data sources. The code also reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The eval(compile()) statement executes the deobfuscated code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the system during package installation.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decrypted through XOR operations with a key derived from the second string, then passed to eval() after compilation, forming a source-to-sink flow that executes potentially malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated, XOR-encoded strings used to conceal code execution logic. The use of eval() with dynamically decoded code during installation is highly suspicious. No explicit malicious payload is visible, but the mechanism indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. Inside run(), it decrypts an obfuscated string by XOR-ing each character with a repeating key derived from a numeric string. After decryption, it executes the resulting code via eval(compile()), which can run arbitrary, possibly malicious code on the user's machine. This behavior is a significant security risk, as it allows hidden malicious actions to be executed silently during package installation. The rest of the setup() function appears standard, but the presence of dynamic code execution during install strongly indicates malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that decrypts and executes obfuscated code at install time, representing a high security threat. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are typical indicators of malicious behavior, making this package unsafe to use.",
