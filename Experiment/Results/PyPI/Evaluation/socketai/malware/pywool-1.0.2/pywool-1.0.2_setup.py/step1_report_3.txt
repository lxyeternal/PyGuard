{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'pywool' with metadata and a custom installation command that executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and the string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp'; it also reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "The 'eval(compile(...))' statement executes dynamically decoded code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a high-risk sink for malicious code.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is decoded by XOR operation with a repeating key, resulting in code that is then compiled and evaluated, enabling malicious payload execution during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code that decodes and executes arbitrary code; use of 'eval' with dynamically decoded code; no clear legitimate reason for obfuscation or runtime code execution during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that contains an obfuscated string. This string is decoded through XOR with a lengthy key, resulting in a code snippet that is then executed via 'eval(compile())'. This behavior indicates intentional concealment of potentially malicious code. The rest of the setup is standard, but the inclusion of code that executes dynamically decoded code during package installation is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed code during package installation, which strongly suggests malicious intent or sabotage. This technique is commonly used to hide malware or backdoors in open-source packages. Therefore, this package should be considered dangerous and should not be used.",
