      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during package setup, referencing a malicious external domain. The behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, such as payload delivery or backdoor installation. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate. This package should be flagged for further analysis and considered malicious until the payload is decoded and verified."
