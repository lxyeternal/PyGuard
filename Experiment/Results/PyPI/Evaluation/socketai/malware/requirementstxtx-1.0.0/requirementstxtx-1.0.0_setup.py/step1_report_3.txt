{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior, potentially executing decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The source of input is the decryption key and encrypted payload used within the custom install class, as well as package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which is a critical sink potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Encrypted data and decryption key flow into Fernet.decrypt(), which then flows into exec(), executing decrypted code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload that decrypts and executes code during installation; unusual for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, when run on Windows (nt), imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'fernet', decrypts some encrypted code using a hardcoded key, and executes it immediately via exec(). The code appears designed to run arbitrary code during package installation, which could be malicious. The setup function registers this custom command, but the encrypted payload's purpose is unclear. Hardcoded keys and dynamic execution are suspicious and typical signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hardcoded decryption key and executes decrypted code during installation, which is highly suspicious and could be malicious. This behavior indicates a probable attempt to run unauthorized or malicious code on target systems during package installation.",
