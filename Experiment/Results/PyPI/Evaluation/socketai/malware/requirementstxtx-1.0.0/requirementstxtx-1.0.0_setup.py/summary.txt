  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, representing a severe security threat. The high obfuscation and hardcoded keys further support malicious intent. All reports' assessments and scores are consistent and justified. This package should be considered malicious and flagged for removal or further analysis before use."
