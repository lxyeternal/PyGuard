{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious behavior involving decrypting and executing code during package installation, indicating a potential supply chain backdoor.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded encrypted payload and Fernet key within the install class, executed during 'nt' (Windows) environment.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), which can run arbitrary malicious code with system privileges.",
  "flows": "Encrypted payload and key are decrypted during install, then passed directly to exec() for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, nonsensical long description strings, use of encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated install class that, on Windows, decrypts a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted string with a fixed key and executes it via exec(). The presence of encrypted payloads, obfuscation, and runtime execution strongly suggest malicious intent. The pattern matches known supply chain attack techniques, with high potential for arbitrary code execution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.9-1.0, obfuscated 0.8, security risk 0.9-1.0) are justified given the evidence. The encrypted payload's content is unknown, but the pattern alone warrants high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through encrypted payload decryption and execution during installation, representing a severe security threat. The high obfuscation and hardcoded keys further support malicious intent. All reports' assessments and scores are consistent and justified. This package should be considered malicious and flagged for removal or further analysis before use.",
