{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup that includes a custom installation command which executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "os.name check, import statements, and the execution of decrypted code via exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code potentially from an external source.",
  "flows": "On Windows, if os.name == 'nt', the code imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes a code string with exec(), which can run arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decrypted data, presence of encrypted payload that executes during installation, and the obfuscated nature of the code suggest malicious intent. The encrypted string may contain malicious code or a backdoor.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a package with a custom install command class. During installation on Windows, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a string with Fernet and executes it using exec(). The encrypted payload is hidden and could execute arbitrary code, which is suspicious. The code uses obfuscated variable names and encrypted strings, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. This pattern is common in malicious packages designed to run unauthorized code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious intent by decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows systems. The use of encrypted payloads and exec() suggests a backdoor or malicious script may be included, representing a security threat. The package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
