{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with an obfuscated custom install command that executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The 'exec' statement within the run method of the custom install class, which executes decrypted code, and the encrypted Fernet token and key embedded in the script.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executing dynamically decrypted code, which can run arbitrary code during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method decrypts a Fernet-encrypted string and executes it via 'exec', potentially running malicious code with system privileges.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable and class names; the presence of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time; no visible legitimate functionality. The code decrypts and executes code dynamically, which is a common technique in malicious installers.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom install command that, when run on Windows systems ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a payload with a hardcoded Fernet key and executes it dynamically using 'exec'. The obfuscation of class and variable names, along with the encrypted payload, indicates an intent to conceal malicious actions. The decrypted code could perform any arbitrary operation, including system modification, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The use of setup_requires with 'fernet' and 'requests' suggests that these dependencies are necessary for the payload's decryption or network communication. Overall, this pattern resembles malicious package behavior designed to execute hidden code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious intent through obfuscated dynamic code execution during package installation, with encrypted payloads and obfuscated class/variable names, indicating a high likelihood of malicious behavior.",
