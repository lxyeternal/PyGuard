  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,

  "conclusion": "The package contains embedded, obfuscated PowerShell code executed silently during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the suspicious behavior. Further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious intent, but current evidence suggests a significant security risk."
