  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom installation step that executes decrypted code if on Windows.",
  "sources": "User input is not directly read; code reads environment variables and package metadata. The key source of untrusted data is the decrypted content within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code with exec(), which could execute malicious or arbitrary code if the decrypted payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "The code checks for Windows OS, then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string, and executes the resulting code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload and exec() to run decrypted code, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The code relies on a hardcoded key and encrypted payload, obfuscating its purpose. The purpose of the decrypted code is unclear, but execution of such code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, if on Windows, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string with Fernet and executes it dynamically. This behavior is suspicious, as it could be used to hide malicious code or backdoors. The use of a hardcoded encryption key and encrypted payload suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity. The overall structure indicates intent to execute arbitrary code during installation, which is a security risk. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard but is overshadowed by this potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk backdoor-like behavior involving decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows systems. This indicates malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior. The presence of encrypted payload and execution mechanism warrants caution, and the package should be considered unsafe.",
