{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to configure and install a Python package named 'py-cordf', including custom installation steps that may execute additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "Input source: None directly from external inputs; dependencies: 'fernet' and 'requests' modules specified in setup_requires; code reads environment info via os.name.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of decrypted code via exec() in the custom install class; network dependencies loaded ('requests' and 'fernet'), but no direct network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "The flow involves the 'run' method decrypting a Fernet-encrypted string, executing its contents via exec(), which could run arbitrary code if the decryption key or ciphertext is malicious or manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during installation; use of exec() on decrypted data is suspicious; hardcoded decryption key and ciphertext; minimal descriptive metadata, which could be an obfuscation tactic.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a package with minimal metadata and a custom install class that overrides the run() method. During installation on Windows systems ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts and executes a payload via exec(). The decrypted code's content is unknown but could contain malicious instructions. The use of hardcoded encryption keys and the dynamic execution of decrypted code indicate a high potential for malicious behavior. The rest of the code appears normal for a setup script. The code does not perform obvious malicious actions outside the exec() call, but the pattern of encrypted code execution is a common technique for hiding malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during installation, which is indicative of potentially malicious intent. This pattern suggests possible backdoor or malicious code execution capability. Given the encrypted payload and execution method, this package should be considered risky and not used without further analysis of the decrypted content.",
