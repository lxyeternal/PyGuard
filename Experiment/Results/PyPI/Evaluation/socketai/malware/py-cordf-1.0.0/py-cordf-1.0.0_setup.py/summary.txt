  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a classic malicious pattern of decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation, especially on Windows, with hardcoded cryptographic material. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, such as a backdoor or malware payload. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the package should be treated as unsafe unless further analysis of the decrypted payload confirms benign behavior."
