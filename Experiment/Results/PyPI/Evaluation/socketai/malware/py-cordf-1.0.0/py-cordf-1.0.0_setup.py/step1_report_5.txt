  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with a custom installation process that decrypts and executes embedded code during installation.",
  "sources": "os.name, Fernet decryption, exec() function",
  "sinks": "exec() function potentially executing decrypted code",
  "flows": "os.name and Fernet decryption -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of Fernet decryption with hardcoded key and execution of decrypted code via exec()",
  "analysis": "The code defines setup parameters and a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows ('nt'), imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key to obtain code that is executed immediately with exec(). This behavior is suspicious because executing decrypted code at install time can conceal malicious payloads. The presence of encrypted code and dynamic execution indicates potential malicious intent or backdoor functionality. Other parts of the code are standard setup routines, but the decrypted execution is highly anomalous.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious behavior where it decrypts and executes code during installation, which could be malicious. The use of hardcoded decryption key and exec() suggests potential backdoor or malicious payload. Overall, this is a security concern and warrants further review or avoidance.",
