{
  "purpose": "The code decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it during installation on Windows systems, indicating potential malicious behavior such as a backdoor or remote code execution.",
  "sources": "The encrypted payload string, the hardcoded Fernet key, and the conditional block within the run() method that triggers during Windows installation.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executing the decrypted code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "On Windows, the code imports cryptographic modules, decrypts the payload with a hardcoded key, and passes the decrypted code directly to exec(), executing potentially malicious code during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded cryptographic key and encrypted payload, conditional execution only on Windows, and dynamic execution of decrypted code suggest obfuscation and malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern involves decrypting a concealed payload with a hardcoded key and executing it during installation, which is a common tactic for malicious backdoors or malware. The use of encrypted strings and conditional execution on Windows indicates targeted malicious behavior. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the core suspicious behavior is the decrypt-and-execute pattern. The high likelihood of malicious intent is supported by the encrypted payload, obfuscation tactics, and dynamic code execution, which are typical indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware. Given the evidence, the code should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a classic malicious pattern of decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation, especially on Windows, with hardcoded cryptographic material. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, such as a backdoor or malware payload. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the package should be treated as unsafe unless further analysis of the decrypted payload confirms benign behavior.",
