{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package with custom installation behavior that conditionally executes code involving decryption and remote requests during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and potentially malicious encrypted payloads; imports 'requests' and 'fernet'; executes decrypted code via 'exec()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec()' function executes decrypted code, which could be malicious; imports 'requests' which can send/receive data over the network.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows ('nt'), the code decrypts a payload and executes it via 'exec()', possibly fetching or sending data over the network using 'requests'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded encryption key for 'Fernet'; execution of decrypted code via 'exec()'; conditional code execution only on Windows; obfuscated description and long description strings; import of 'requests' and 'fernet' only within conditional block.",
  "analysis": "The setup script appears to perform a potentially malicious operation by decrypting a hardcoded payload and executing it dynamically during installation on Windows systems. The presence of 'exec()' with decrypted code suggests execution of potentially arbitrary code, which can be malicious. The code imports 'requests' and 'fernet' only when on Windows, indicating a targeted malicious behavior. The description fields are obfuscated, possibly to hide intent. The code's structure and the use of hardcoded cryptographic material strongly suggest malicious intent or sabotage, especially considering execution of decrypted payloads at install time.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, notably the decryption and execution of code during installation, which can be used for malicious purposes such as installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or executing arbitrary code. It is highly suspicious and should be considered dangerous for use.",
