  "sources": "No input or data reading functions, no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks, output functions, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified as there are no operations or data processing in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The file is empty aside from a comment; no suspicious code or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a comment indicating it's an __init__.py file for a utils package. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external interactions present. As such, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze for security risks or malicious behavior. The file's purpose appears to be purely structural for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and serves only as a package initializer with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
