  "purpose": "Initialization for the utils package, likely to set up modules or functions for reuse.",
  "sources": "No data sources are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code logic, variables, or suspicious constructs; very minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is merely a comment indicating that this is an __init__.py file for a package named utils. It contains no executable code, data input, or output, and no embedded logic that could be malicious. As a standard package initializer, it poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple placeholder comment with no executable or malicious content. It does not introduce any security risks or malware. The code appears benign and typical for Python package initialization files.",
