{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a minimal placeholder for the utils package, specifically an empty __init__.py file with only a comment.",
  "sources": "There are no sources; the code contains only a comment and no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no executable code or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist due to the absence of code; the file contains only a comment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code structures are present; the file is a simple placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is an empty __init__.py file with only a comment, indicating it functions solely as a package initializer. No executable statements, data handling, or external interactions are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the lack of sources, sinks, or flows. All review reports correctly identify this minimal, harmless state. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Given the simplicity and benign intent, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal placeholder __init__.py file with no executable content or security concerns. All review scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
