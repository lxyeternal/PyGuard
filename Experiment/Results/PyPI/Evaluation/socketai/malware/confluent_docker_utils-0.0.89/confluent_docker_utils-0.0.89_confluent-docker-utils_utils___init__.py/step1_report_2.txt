  "anomalies": "The code snippet is empty aside from a comment, with no executable code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only a comment indicating the purpose of the __init__.py file for the utils package. There are no executable statements, data inputs, or potentially malicious constructs. Since the file is minimal and non-functional beyond documentation, there is no evidence of malware, security issues, or obfuscation. The file serves as a package initializer, a common practice in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple comment serving as documentation for the package initialization and does not contain any malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
