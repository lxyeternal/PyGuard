  "purpose": "A simple Python script to format code by removing trailing whitespace, ensuring a newline at the end, and replacing tabs with spaces.",
  "sources": "Reading input code string; reading from and writing to files",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Input code is processed through regex substitutions and string replacements; no external data flows or network activity",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in `if not code ends with '\\n':` (missing dot in `endswith`), which prevents correct execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign formatting utility with a syntax bug that affects runtime correctness. The provided reports are empty and do not contain any analysis or findings. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The syntax error is a minor flaw but does not imply malicious intent. The code does not perform any dangerous operations or contain hidden backdoors. Given the lack of malicious signals and the benign purpose, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal, approximately 0.2 due to the syntax bug affecting code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious formatting utility with a minor syntax error. The reports are empty and do not provide any evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect the benign nature of the code, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low risk score primarily due to the syntax bug that impairs functionality.",
