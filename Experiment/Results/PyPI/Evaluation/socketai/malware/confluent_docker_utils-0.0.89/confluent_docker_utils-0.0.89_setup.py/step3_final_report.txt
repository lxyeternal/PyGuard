  "purpose": "The setup script executes an internal module '{PACKAGE_NAME}.utils.analyzer' during installation via subprocess call, potentially for analytics or setup tasks.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call: subprocess.call([sys.executable, '-m', f'{PACKAGE_NAME}.utils.analyzer'])",
  "sinks": "Execution of the internal module during setup, which could run arbitrary code if malicious",
  "flows": "From the subprocess call during setup to the execution of the 'analyzer' module's code",
  "anomalies": "Execution of internal module during installation without validation or sandboxing; no obfuscation or secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code executes an internal module during setup, which is not inherently malicious but can be exploited if the module contains malicious code. No external input influences this execution, reducing injection risk. The pattern is suspicious because it runs code during install, which could be a backdoor or malicious payload if the module is compromised. The scores across reports vary; high scores (0.75) suggest suspicion of malicious intent, justified if the module is malicious. Lower scores (0.2-0.3) assume benign intent. Given the pattern, a malware score of around 0.6-0.75 is appropriate if the module's integrity is uncertain. The obfuscated score is correctly zero. The security risk score should reflect the potential for arbitrary code execution, thus around 0.6-0.75. Overall, the pattern warrants caution but is not definitively malicious; further validation of the 'analyzer' module is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "Executing an internal module during setup poses a security risk, especially if the module is malicious or tampered with. The code itself is not malicious but the pattern is suspicious. Scores should be adjusted to reflect the potential for malicious behavior, with malware scores around 0.6-0.75 and risk scores similarly elevated. Further investigation of the 'analyzer' module is advised to confirm its integrity.",
