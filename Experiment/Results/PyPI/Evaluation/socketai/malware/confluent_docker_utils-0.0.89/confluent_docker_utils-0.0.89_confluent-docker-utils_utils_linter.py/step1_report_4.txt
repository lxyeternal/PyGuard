{
  "purpose": "The code implements a basic linter to check Python source files for trailing whitespace and whether the file ends with a newline.",
  "sources": "The code reads the contents of a specified file ('file_path') using open() and read() functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs messages to standard output via print() statements; it does not send data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input source: file read via open(); output sink: print() statements displaying linting issues.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The sample code creates and writes to a file but does not contain malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static text analysis on Python source files to identify formatting issues. It defines functions to check for trailing whitespace lines and whether the file ends with a newline. It reads a sample code string, writes it to a file, and runs the linter. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's purpose is benign and purely for code style enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious utility for linting Python files. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
