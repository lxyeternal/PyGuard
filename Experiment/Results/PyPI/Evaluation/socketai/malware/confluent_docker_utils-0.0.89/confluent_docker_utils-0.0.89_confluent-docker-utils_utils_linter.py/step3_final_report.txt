  "purpose": "A simple Python script that checks a file for trailing whitespace and whether it ends with a newline, serving as a basic linter for style issues.",
  "sources": "Reads the entire file content into a string, specifically the file specified by file_path.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results via print statements; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> Checks for trailing whitespace and missing newline -> Reports via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static style checks on a file, using regex to identify trailing whitespace and a simple string check for newline at EOF. It does not process untrusted input beyond reading a file, nor does it execute dynamic code or perform network operations. The logic is clear, correct, and benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior. Given the benign nature, the risk score should be set to 0, and malware score remains 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate scores. No improvements or corrections are necessary.",
