{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple Python script that performs basic linting tasks on a given Python file, specifically checking for trailing whitespace and whether the file ends with a newline.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from a file specified by 'file_path', particularly reading the contents of the file to analyze for linting issues.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to the console via print statements; no untrusted data is processed or sent elsewhere. No sinks handle untrusted data in a way that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input is read from a file ('file_path'), analyzed in-memory (checking for trailing whitespace and newline at EOF), and results are printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for linting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a specified file, performs regex-based checks for trailing whitespace, and verifies if the file ends with a newline. It then reports issues via print statements. The code uses standard Python functions and regex; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity is evident. The sample code created is benign, and the functions serve purely for static analysis without any harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, benign Python script intended for linting files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not process or transmit untrusted data in a harmful manner. The overall security risk is very low.",
