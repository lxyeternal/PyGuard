{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple Python linter that checks for trailing whitespace and whether the file ends with a newline.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of the specified Python source file 'sample_file.py'.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process untrusted input data beyond reading the file content, nor does it perform any output that could leak information.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> Checks for trailing whitespace and newline issues -> Reports findings.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs basic linting tasks; no unusual behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious activity detected. The sample code writes to a file but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Python source file, checks for trailing whitespace and whether the file ends with a newline, and reports issues. The functions are straightforward and focus solely on style enforcement. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The sample code creates a file and performs the linting, all benign actions. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward Python linter for style issues. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
