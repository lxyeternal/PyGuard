{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external Python script during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' from which the code downloads a Python script.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'qrcodes.py' via subprocess, which runs the downloaded code in the current environment.",
  "flows": "During installation, the script fetches 'qrcodes.py' from the specified URL and executes it immediately, creating a source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of a remote script during installation; no validation or checks on the fetched code; hardcoded URL; potential for malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard install command to fetch a Python script from a hardcoded external URL during installation. It then immediately executes this script using subprocess, which can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the installer. There are no security checks, validation, or integrity verification (e.g., checksum or signature), making this a significant security risk. The pattern indicates a possible backdoor or malicious behavior, as it allows remote code execution at install time without user consent or validation.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during installation without validation. This could be used for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, data theft, or other harmful activities.",
