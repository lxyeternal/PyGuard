  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process of a Python package to download and execute an external Python script during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' where the external script is fetched.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'qrcodes.py']).",
  "flows": "The code fetches code from the URL (source) and immediately executes it (sink), establishing a direct flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatically downloading and executing external code during installation, which is highly suspicious and atypical for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, fetches a Python script from an external URL and executes it immediately. This behavior introduces significant security risks because the external script could contain malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. The rest of the setup code appears standard with no other suspicious elements. The external script is not validated, and its source is untrusted, making this potentially malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during package installation, which could lead to system compromise or data theft. This is a high-risk supply chain attack vector.",
