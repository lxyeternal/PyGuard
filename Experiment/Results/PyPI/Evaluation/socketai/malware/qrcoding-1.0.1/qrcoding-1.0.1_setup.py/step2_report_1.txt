  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and evaluating the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The setup script defines a custom install command (`CustomInstallCommand`) that, during installation:\n  - Downloads a Python script from a hardcoded URL (`https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py`) using `requests.get()`.\n  - Saves it as `qrcodes.py`.\n  - Executes it immediately via `subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'qrcodes.py'])`.\n- No validation, checksum, or signature verification is performed on the downloaded code.\n- The code is obfuscated or malicious behavior is not explicitly indicated, but the pattern is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Confirmation\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code explicitly downloads and executes remote code during installation, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws in the Reports\n- All reports correctly identify the core malicious pattern: remote code download and execution during package install.\n- They uniformly describe the behavior as suspicious, malicious, or a security risk.\n- The reasoning is consistent: unvalidated remote code execution during setup is dangerous and often associated with supply chain attacks or malware.\n\n**No major logical flaws are evident** in the reasoning of these reports.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 0.9, which seems appropriate given the clear pattern.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, which is reasonable; the code isn't obfuscated.\n- **Malware Score:** All assign 0.9, indicating high suspicion of malicious intent.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The core behavior is dangerous and aligns with malware activity, justifying high scores.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \n- Since the code's intent isn't explicitly confirmed as malicious (e.g., no direct evidence of malicious payloads), some might argue a slightly lower malware score (e.g., 0.8).  \n- However, given the behavior (remote code execution during install without validation), 0.9 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Security Risk Score Justification\n- The reports assign 0.9 or 0.95, indicating a very high risk.  \n- This is appropriate because:\n  - Remote code execution during install is a classic supply chain attack vector.\n  - It can lead to system compromise, data theft, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Claims and Assumptions\n- The reports assume malicious intent based on behavior.  \n- Given the code pattern, this assumption is reasonable; there's no evidence suggesting benign use.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Discrepancies\n- The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the same core issue.\n- The slight variation in the last report's `securityRisk` (0.95 vs. 0.9) is acceptable, emphasizing the high risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation\n**Malware Score:** 0.9 (justified by remote code execution pattern)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.9 (or higher, e.g., 0.95, considering the severity)\n\n---\n\n### Additional Recommendations\n- The code should be flagged as malicious or at least highly suspicious.\n- Users should be warned against installing such packages.\n- Package maintainers should be scrutinized for malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Suggested Score | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0.9**                 | Clear remote code execution, high suspicion of malicious activity |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation                     |\n| Security Risk    | **0.9-0.95**            | High risk due to remote code execution during install       |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the high scores assigned in the reports, with a slight emphasis on the severity of the security risk.**",
