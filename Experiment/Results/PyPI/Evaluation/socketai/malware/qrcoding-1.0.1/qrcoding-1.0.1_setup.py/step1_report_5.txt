{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external Python script during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' used in requests.get() to fetch external code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'qrcodes.py' using subprocess.check_call() which runs downloaded code with the current Python interpreter.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves code from external source -> file write 'qrcodes.py' -> subprocess.check_call() executes the downloaded script.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads a script from an external URL and executes it during installation without validation, which is highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command to perform custom actions during package installation. It downloads a Python script from an external server and immediately executes it, bypassing typical package security. This external code could contain malicious activities such as data theft, system compromise, or backdoors. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the external download and execution is a critical security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains a malicious pattern by downloading and executing external code during installation, representing a significant security risk. It is likely intended to run arbitrary code from an external source, which can be malicious.",
