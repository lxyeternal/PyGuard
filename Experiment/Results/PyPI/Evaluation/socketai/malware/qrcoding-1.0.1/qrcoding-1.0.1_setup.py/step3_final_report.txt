{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a Python script from a remote URL during installation and executes it immediately, without validation, posing a security risk.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' fetched via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via subprocess.check_call()",
  "flows": "Fetch from URL -> save as 'qrcodes.py' -> execute with sys.executable",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional remote code download and execution during setup without validation or signature verification",
  "analysis": "The setup script overrides the install command to fetch and run external code during installation, which is highly suspicious. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but performs remote code execution without validation, creating a significant security vulnerability. The high scores for malware (0.9) and security risk (0.95) are justified due to the potential for malicious payloads, backdoors, or system compromise. All reports correctly identify this pattern and assign consistent high scores, reflecting the severity of the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious intent due to remote code execution during installation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the behavior. This pattern is indicative of supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms, warranting high security concern.",
