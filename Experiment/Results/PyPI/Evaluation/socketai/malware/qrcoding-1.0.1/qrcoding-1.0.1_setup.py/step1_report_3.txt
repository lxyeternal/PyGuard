{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines a custom installation process for the 'qrcoding' package, which downloads and executes an external Python script during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL ('https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py') using requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The downloaded script ('qrcodes.py') is written to disk and then executed via subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'qrcodes.py']).",
  "flows": "Input flows from the external URL to a local file, then from the local file to execution, enabling remote code execution during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes an external script during installation without any validation or verification, which is highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package installation. The CustomInstallCommand class overrides the run method to download a remote Python script from a specified URL. The script is saved locally as 'qrcodes.py' and then executed immediately. This behavior allows remote code to run during package installation, which is a common method for delivering malicious payloads or backdoors. The code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded script, nor does it restrict or log this action. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent or supply chain attack risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during package installation without verification. This poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
