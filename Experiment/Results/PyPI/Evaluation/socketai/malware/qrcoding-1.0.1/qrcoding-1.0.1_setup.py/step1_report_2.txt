{
  "purpose": "To define a setup configuration for a Python package named 'qrcoding' with a custom install process.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py' from which code is downloaded during installation.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded 'qrcodes.py' file is executed directly with the Python interpreter, creating a potential execution sink.",
  "flows": "The install process fetches code from the URL and immediately executes it with sys.executable, establishing a source-to-sink flow that executes remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Fetching and executing a remote script during package installation is highly unusual and suspicious. No validation or sandboxing of the downloaded code is performed.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard installation process by downloading a Python script from an external URL during installation. It then executes this remote code directly, which could be malicious. The use of subprocess to run the fetched script, combined with no integrity checks, represents a significant security risk. This behavior resembles malicious supply chain tactics, potentially enabling remote code execution, backdoors, or other malicious activities upon installation. The rest of the setup code appears typical, but the remote code execution is the critical concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing external code during installation without validation, representing a high security risk. This behavior is highly suspicious and likely malicious, with potential for remote code execution.",
