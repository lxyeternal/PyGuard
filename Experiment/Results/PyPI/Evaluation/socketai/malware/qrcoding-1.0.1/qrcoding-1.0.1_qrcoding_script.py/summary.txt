  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The main risk stems from the external script 'my_script.py', which is outside the scope of this review. The use of os.system() with a static command poses minimal immediate risk, but caution is advised if the external script is untrusted. Overall, the code is low risk with no malware detected."
