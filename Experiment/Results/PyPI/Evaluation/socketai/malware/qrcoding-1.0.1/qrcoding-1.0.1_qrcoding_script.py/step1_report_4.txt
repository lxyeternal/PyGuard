  "purpose": "Execute an external script named 'my_script.py' using the operating system shell.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing 'python my_script.py'",
  "sinks": "Execution of external script via os.system with untrusted input could lead to code execution or command injection if the input were dynamic (though in this case it's static).",
  "flows": "Static command 'python my_script.py' executed directly from code, with no dynamic or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with a fixed string is not inherently malicious; however, it can be risky if the command string is constructed from untrusted sources. No such construction here; the command is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and defines a main function that calls os.system to execute 'python my_script.py'. This is a straightforward script execution command without dynamic input, so it does not exhibit malicious behavior or malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs. The pattern is simple and typical for script invocation.\n\nPotential security considerations include the general risk of os.system if user input is incorporated, but in this case, the command is static. No obfuscation or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic external script call with no indications of malicious behavior. It is a simple script runner without malicious intent or suspicious activity, assuming the context is benign.",
