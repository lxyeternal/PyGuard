{
  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script ('my_script.py') using the operating system's command line interface.",
  "sources": "os.system() call that executes 'python my_script.py'",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'my_script.py' via os.system() which could run arbitrary code or scripts if input is manipulated",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted input is directly used; the flow is straightforward: main() calls os.system() to run a fixed script",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to run a script without validation or input sanitization; no user input involved but the method itself is risky if modified",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and defines a main() function that executes 'python my_script.py' via os.system(). This is a simple command execution pattern. While the current code executes a fixed script without dynamic input, using os.system() poses security risks if the script name or command were to be manipulated or extended in future modifications. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs present. The code does not appear malicious on its own, but it could be used maliciously if the script path or command is altered or if the script itself is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code's current form does not contain malicious behavior but employs a risky method of executing external scripts. It should be reviewed for safe script sources and potentially replaced with safer subprocess management if needed.",
