{
  "purpose": "The code executes a static external script 'my_script.py' using os.system, serving as a simple script runner.",
  "sources": "The call to os.system('python my_script.py') which executes an external script.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call, which executes the command in the shell environment.",
  "flows": "Static command string flows directly from the code to the shell execution environment.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic command construction, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing os and executing a fixed command to run 'my_script.py'. There are no user inputs, no obfuscation, and no malicious code present within this snippet. The primary security concern depends on the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The use of os.system() is generally discouraged due to potential shell injection risks, but with a static command, the immediate risk is low. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious intent is evident. The security risk score could be slightly elevated if considering external script trustworthiness, but overall, the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The main risk stems from the external script 'my_script.py', which is outside the scope of this review. The use of os.system() with a static command poses minimal immediate risk, but caution is advised if the external script is untrusted. Overall, the code is low risk with no malware detected.",
