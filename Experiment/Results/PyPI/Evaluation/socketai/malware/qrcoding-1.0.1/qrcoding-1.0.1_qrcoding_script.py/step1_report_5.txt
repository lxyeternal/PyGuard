{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script 'my_script.py' via a system call.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it relies on a fixed command string in os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing 'python my_script.py' could be a sink if 'my_script.py' is malicious or tampered.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code; the flow is static command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system with a fixed command is straightforward; no obfuscation or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and defines a main() function that executes 'python my_script.py' via os.system. The script is invoked unconditionally if the module runs as main. There are no user inputs, no dynamic command generation, and no obfuscation. The code's purpose appears to be to run another script, potentially part of a larger process. Without additional context, there is no evident malicious behavior or suspicious activity, but executing external scripts always carries a risk if the script itself is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and straightforward, with no immediate signs of malicious intent or security issues. Its security implications depend entirely on the content of 'my_script.py'. As it stands, the code itself is benign but warrants caution if the invoked script is untrusted.",
