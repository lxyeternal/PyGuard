{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script named 'my_script.py' using the operating system's command line interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it solely invokes a system command.",
  "sinks": "The call to os.system() executes a command that could run any script or command specified, potentially leading to code execution or system compromise if 'my_script.py' is malicious or manipulated.",
  "flows": "The code source (os.system call) triggers execution of 'python my_script.py', which is a sink that executes code on the system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to run an external script is potentially risky, especially if 'my_script.py' can be modified or is untrusted. No input validation or environment checks are performed.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, simply calling os.system() with a hardcoded script name. There is no validation, sanitization, or dynamic input. If 'my_script.py' is malicious or altered, executing it could lead to malicious actions such as code execution, data access, or system modification. The code itself does not contain malicious code but relies on external content. The pattern of invoking external scripts via os.system() can be dangerous if the script content is not trusted or can be manipulated.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is straightforward but potentially dangerous if 'my_script.py' is malicious or compromised. It does not contain malicious logic directly but relies on an external script that could be malicious. The use of os.system() to run external code without validation poses security risks.",
