{
  "purpose": "Execute 'python my_script.py' via os.system",
  "sources": "No untrusted input; static command string in os.system call",
  "sinks": "External script execution; potential if 'my_script.py' is malicious",
  "flows": "Static command in os.system leads to execution of 'my_script.py'",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines main() which calls os.system with a fixed command, and executes main() if run directly. No dynamic input or user data influences the command. The command is static, reducing command injection risk. The main concern is the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py', which is external and outside the scope of this snippet. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2-0.3) due to reliance on external script. The code itself is benign; risks depend on external content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The static command minimizes immediate risks. Overall, the code is low risk and safe if 'my_script.py' is trustworthy.",
