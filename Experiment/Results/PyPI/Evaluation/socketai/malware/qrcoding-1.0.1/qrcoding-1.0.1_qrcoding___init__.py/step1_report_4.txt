  "purpose": "Execute an external script named 'my_script.py' using the system shell.",
  "sources": "os.system('python my_script.py')",
  "sinks": "Execution of system shell command that runs an external Python script",
  "flows": "Code reaches os.system call, which runs 'python my_script.py' in the shell",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to run an external script; no validation or sanitization of input; minimal code complexity",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a main function that calls os.system to execute 'python my_script.py'. This is a straightforward script execution command. The code itself does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It appears to run an external script without any checks or input validation, which could be potentially dangerous if 'my_script.py' is malicious or compromised. The use of os.system to execute a command is a point of concern, but there are no signs of malicious payloads within this snippet. Overall, the code is simple and its risk depends on the content of 'my_script.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary behavior is to run an external Python script via the system shell. There are no indications of malicious intent within this code snippet itself, but it could pose security risks depending on the contents and trustworthiness of 'my_script.py'. The use of os.system without input validation is a concern but not inherently malicious.",
