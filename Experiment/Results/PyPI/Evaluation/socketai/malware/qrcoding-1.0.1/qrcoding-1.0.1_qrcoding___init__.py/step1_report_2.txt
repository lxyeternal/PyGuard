  "purpose": "Execute another Python script ('my_script.py') using the system shell.",
  "sources": "os.system('python my_script.py')",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that executes an external command",
  "flows": "Input is the hardcoded command string; flows into the system shell execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to execute a script dynamically; no input sanitization or validation; potential for command injection if command string were variable, but here it is static",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main function that calls os.system with a fixed command to run 'my_script.py'. The script is straightforward and does not accept external input, reducing immediate risk. However, the use of os.system to execute external scripts can be risky if the command string were to be influenced by untrusted sources, which is not the case here. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code could be exploited if modified to accept user input for commands, but as it stands, it simply runs a fixed script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple script execution pattern with no evident malicious intent or security issues in its current form. The main concern would be if future modifications allow user input into the command, potentially enabling command injection. As written, it is low risk.",
