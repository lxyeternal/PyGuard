{
  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script named 'my_script.py' using the operating system command.",
  "sources": "os.system('python my_script.py')",
  "sinks": "os.system call, which executes a command in the system shell",
  "flows": "Input from the code is the command string, which is executed in the shell; no user input is directly involved in the current code",
  "anomalies": "The use of os.system to execute a script could be exploited if the command string were dynamic or influenced by untrusted data. In this case, the command is hardcoded, reducing risk. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and defines a main function that calls os.system to run 'python my_script.py'. This can be a security concern if 'my_script.py' is malicious or compromised. Since the command is static and does not incorporate external inputs, there is no immediate risk. However, executing scripts via os.system can be dangerous if the filename or command were influenced by user input. The script does not contain any other suspicious or malicious code, and there are no obfuscation techniques used.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply runs an external script using os.system. While this has potential security implications if misused or if 'my_script.py' is malicious, based solely on this code, there is no malicious behavior. It warrants cautious review of 'my_script.py' separately, but the code itself is straightforward.",
