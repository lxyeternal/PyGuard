{
  "purpose": "Execute an external Python script named 'my_script.py' via the system shell.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing 'python my_script.py'",
  "sinks": "External process execution via os.system, which can run arbitrary commands if inputs are manipulated",
  "flows": "No untrusted input sources are explicitly present; the code runs a fixed command, so no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system to run a fixed command without input validation; no evidence of malicious payload within this code itself",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and defines a main function that calls os.system with a fixed command to run 'my_script.py'. The code is straightforward, with no user input, environment variables, or dynamic command execution. The main concern is that if 'my_script.py' is malicious or replaced, it could cause harm, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely executes a static Python script through the system shell. It does not contain malicious behavior itself but relies on 'my_script.py'. The use of os.system is a potential security concern if the command were constructed dynamically or influenced by untrusted input, but in this case, the command is fixed. No malware or obfuscation detected in this code fragment.",
