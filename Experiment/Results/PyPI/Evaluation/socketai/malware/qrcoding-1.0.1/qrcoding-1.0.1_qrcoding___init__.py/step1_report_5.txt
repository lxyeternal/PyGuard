{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external Python script ('my_script.py') using the system shell.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only executes a predefined command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call is a sink where executing arbitrary commands could occur if the command string is manipulated.",
  "flows": "The script runs 'python my_script.py' directly via the shell, with no untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses os.system with a hardcoded command. No dynamic or untrusted input is processed. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, calling os.system to execute a fixed command. It does not accept user input, nor does it construct commands dynamically. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of os.system is a common pattern, but it can be dangerous if the command string is influenced by external input, which is not the case here.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply executes a fixed script without handling untrusted input or performing any suspicious operations. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this minimal code snippet.",
