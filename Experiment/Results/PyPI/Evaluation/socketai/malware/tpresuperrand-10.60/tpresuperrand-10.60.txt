      "conclusion": "The package contains highly suspicious code that executes an obfuscated PowerShell command during installation, triggered by the absence of a specific directory. The command's nature, obfuscation, and embedded URL strongly suggest malicious intent. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. Deployment of this package poses a significant security threat, and further decoding of the payload is recommended to confirm malicious activity."
