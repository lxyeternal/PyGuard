{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, environment variable access, or network communication typical of benign scripts.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, function parameters, or standard input streams.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file output, environment variables, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. No suspicious functions like eval or exec are present. The absence of code or suspicious patterns suggests benign intent. Security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible. Confidence is high due to the lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The low security risk score and zero malware score are justified. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
