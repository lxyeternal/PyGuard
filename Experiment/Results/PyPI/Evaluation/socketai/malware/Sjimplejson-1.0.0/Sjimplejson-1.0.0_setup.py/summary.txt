  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation, which can facilitate remote code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of encrypted payloads, hardcoded cryptographic keys, and obfuscated strings strongly suggests malicious intent. The package should be considered malicious and flagged for removal or further investigation."
