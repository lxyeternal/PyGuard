{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom install command that decrypts and executes remote code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, environment variables, and executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), remote code execution, and network request to fetch external code (via requests) on Windows.",
  "flows": "During installation on Windows, the script imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes external code, which can lead to code execution from remote sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time; executing code via exec() with decrypted content; remote code execution potential; code is intentionally obfuscated with random strings and encrypted payloads; the presence of a hardcoded Fernet key.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package with metadata. The custom install class runs during setup; if on Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, then decrypts and executes code via exec(). The decryption key and payload are hardcoded, indicating malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The decrypted code likely contains malicious actions such as remote code execution or data exfiltration. The overall structure and use of obfuscated strings and encrypted payloads suggest intent to hide malicious behavior. The package's setup_requires includes potentially unnecessary dependencies, but the critical concern is the runtime execution of decrypted code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by decrypting and executing remote or hidden code during installation on Windows systems. The encrypted payload and use of exec() are classic indicators of a backdoor or malware, posing a high security risk. The code is intentionally obfuscated, and the hardcoded key and payload suggest malicious intent.",
