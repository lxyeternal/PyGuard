  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'Sjimplejson' that includes a custom install command performing conditional remote code execution and decryption.",
  "sources": "Reading environment info (os.name), importing modules, decrypting embedded encrypted payload, reading setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, importing potentially malicious modules ('requests', 'fernet') dynamically, network requests via 'requests' if on Windows.",
  "flows": "If on Windows, os.name=='nt' triggers import of 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload executed at runtime via exec(), obfuscated strings, use of Fernet encryption with hardcoded key, conditional remote code execution based on OS.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script with a custom install command class. The class checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts an embedded encrypted payload with a hardcoded key and executes it via exec(). The presence of encrypted code, dynamic execution, and conditional network activity suggests potential malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads during installation. The setup also specifies dependencies 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used for network communication and cryptography. The code's obfuscation, encrypted payload, and conditional remote code execution pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to encrypted payload execution via exec(), conditional remote code execution, and obfuscated strings. These behaviors are typical of malicious package behavior attempting to hide malicious activities during installation. The package should be considered dangerous until further analysis confirms safety.",
