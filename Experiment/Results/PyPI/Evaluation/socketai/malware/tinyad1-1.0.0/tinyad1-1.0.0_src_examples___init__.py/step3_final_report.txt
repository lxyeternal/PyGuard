{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, ensuring supply chain integrity.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points such as network calls, environment variables, file I/O, or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network transmissions, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks, including any suspicious transformations or injections.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0 are consistent with the absence of malicious code. The security risk score of 0.2 is conservative but acceptable; however, given the lack of vulnerabilities, it can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy. Confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough reviews. No anomalies or suspicious data flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate, but the security risk score should be updated to 0 to better reflect the benign nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
