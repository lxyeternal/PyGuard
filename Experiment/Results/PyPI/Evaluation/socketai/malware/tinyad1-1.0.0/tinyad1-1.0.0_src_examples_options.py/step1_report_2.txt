  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script or package module, but since the code was not provided, the exact intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly identified; potential sources could include environment variables, user input functions, or data files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file write operations, subprocess calls, or environment variable access if present.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be evaluated without specific code; generally, untrusted data could flow into sensitive operations if present.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without the code. Absence of code precludes detection of hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Normally, this would involve checking for suspicious imports, code structure, dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "Without the code snippet, a definitive assessment cannot be made. No evidence of malicious behavior can be confirmed or denied, but the lack of code prevents identifying potential security issues.",
