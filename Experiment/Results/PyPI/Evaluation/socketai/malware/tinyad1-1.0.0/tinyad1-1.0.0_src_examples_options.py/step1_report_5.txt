{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables and function parameters; no external data sources or network inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to standard output, files, or returned from functions; no suspicious sinks like network connections or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, parameters) through processing functions to output destinations (stdout, files). No suspicious or external flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified. No unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical operations such as data validation, processing, and output. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present. Usage of third-party libraries is standard. The structure and formatting are clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
