  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python module or script potentially intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or possibly external files or network sources if present. Specific sources are not evident due to the absence of explicit input or data reading code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data transmissions if present, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code fragment. No direct sinks like system commands, network calls, or database queries are detected.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows, as the code appears to be straightforward function definitions or data processing without external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed. The code structure appears normal and does not include suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows that the code contains standard Python functions or classes with typical syntax. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code uses conventional programming constructs, and no suspicious external dependencies or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears benign with no obvious signs of malware or security issues.",
