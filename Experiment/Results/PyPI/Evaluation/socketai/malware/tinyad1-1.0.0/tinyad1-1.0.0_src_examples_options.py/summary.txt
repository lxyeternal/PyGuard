  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The analysis indicates no confirmed malicious activity in the code samples, but some suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution and obfuscation signs warrant a cautious approach. The scores are generally consistent with the observed features, though a slight increase in malware and obfuscation scores for report 3 is justified to better reflect potential risks."
