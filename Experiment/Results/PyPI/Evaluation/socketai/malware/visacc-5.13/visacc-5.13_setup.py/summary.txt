  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the stealthy, obfuscated PowerShell command executed during setup. The high obfuscation and silent execution strongly indicate malicious intent, warranting caution. Without decoding the payload, definitive confirmation isn't possible, but the indicators justify treating this package as potentially malicious."
