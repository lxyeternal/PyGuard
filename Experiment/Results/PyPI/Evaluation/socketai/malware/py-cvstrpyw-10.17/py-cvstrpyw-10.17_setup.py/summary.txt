  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, conditional execution of a PowerShell command during package setup, with suspicious URL and obfuscation techniques. These indicators strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting high malware and risk scores. The package should be considered compromised or malicious until further payload analysis confirms safety."
