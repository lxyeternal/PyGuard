{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from browsers and applications, then exfiltrating this data via Discord webhooks and file uploads. It functions as a credential stealer and data exfiltration tool, often used maliciously.",
  "sources": "Input sources include local files such as browser database files, logs, and local state files; environment variables; user input; and network responses from APIs (IP geolocation, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via Discord webhooks, HTTP POST requests to external servers, and file uploads to third-party services (e.g., gofile.io). Files are written to temporary directories before being uploaded or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local browser and application data files (e.g., cookies, login data, tokens) through decryption and parsing functions, then into global variables. From there, data is assembled into JSON payloads, sent to webhooks, or uploaded to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code installs missing modules automatically, which could be suspicious. It also kills processes related to browsers and wallets before zipping files, which suggests malicious intent. It contains hardcoded webhook URLs, specific targeting of browser and wallet data, and extensive data collection routines. The presence of multiple exfiltration methods (file uploads, webhook posts) and the use of encryption/decryption for tokens and passwords are characteristic of malicious tools. The code includes functions for stealing tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and even system info, then exfiltrates this data silently.",
  "analysis": "The code is a credential and data stealer designed to extract browser-stored passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and files from various applications. It decrypts sensitive data using Windows APIs and master keys, gathers user info, and exfiltrates the data via Discord webhooks and file hosting services. It also kills processes related to targeted applications before zipping their data directories to evade detection. The code's structure, including the automatic module installation, process termination, and extensive data harvesting, strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at unauthorized data theft. It appears to be part of a malicious toolkit or malware designed for credential harvesting, privacy invasion, and data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is malicious, serving as a credential, token, and file stealer that exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads. It actively terminates processes to access data, decrypts sensitive information, and targets browsers, wallets, and messaging apps. The use of hardcoded webhook URLs, process-killing routines, and data encryption methods all support its malicious intent. Overall, this code is highly dangerous and should not be used or trusted.",
