{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers, applications, and directories on a Windows system, then upload the collected data to a remote server via Discord webhook and file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Data sources include browser local storage, SQLite login databases, cookie files, local state files, and user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It reads input from log files, database files, and directory listings, and fetches environment variables and network responses.",
  "sinks": "The code exfiltrates data by sending it to a specified Discord webhook, uploading files to anonymous file hosting services (gofile.io), and potentially accessing system APIs for decryption. It also attempts to kill processes associated with targeted applications before zipping and uploading files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading local files and directories (browser storage, login databases, cookies, environment variables), decryption (using Windows API and AES), to then being aggregated into strings or files, and finally sent via HTTP POST requests to remote servers and upload services.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains several suspicious behaviors: automatic installation of dependencies without user consent, process termination commands targeting specific applications, extensive data harvesting from browsers and applications, embedding of webhook URLs, use of hardcoded URLs, and methods to decrypt stored credentials. It also does not include any user notification or consent mechanisms, and attempts to hide or obfuscate its activity. The code structure and variable naming suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a credential and data stealer, focusing on extracting tokens, passwords, cookies, billing info, and files from browsers and applications. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies, collects user tokens from Discord-related directories, and gathers files matching certain keywords. It uses threading for parallel processing and uploads data to external servers via webhooks and anonymous file hosts. The code forcibly kills processes like browsers and wallets to access their data, compresses and uploads these files, and hides its operations. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, process-killing commands, and extensive credential harvesting strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also installs missing modules silently, which is suspicious. Overall, the code aims to clandestinely steal sensitive data, process it, and send it to remote servers, fitting the profile of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to silently harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, files, and system information, then exfiltrate this data to external servers. It employs multiple techniques to access protected data, including process termination, decryption of stored credentials, and network requests. The use of hardcoded URLs, obfuscation hints, and lack of user consent confirm its malicious nature.",
