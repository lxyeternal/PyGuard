{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a credential, token, cookie, and file stealer, decrypting stored data from browsers and applications, terminating related processes, and exfiltrating the collected information via webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Local browser storage files, SQLite databases, environment variables, network responses, and local directories containing credentials, tokens, cookies, and files.",
  "sinks": "Exfiltration occurs through HTTP requests to Discord webhooks, file uploads to external servers, and network API calls for data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data is read from local files and databases, decrypted using Windows APIs and AES routines, aggregated into structured payloads, and transmitted via webhooks or uploaded files, often after terminating related processes to access data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, silent dependency installation via subprocess, process termination commands targeting browsers and wallets, extensive data collection routines, and some pattern matching suggest obfuscation or stealth techniques.",
  "analysis": "The script actively searches for sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files across user directories and browser storage. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows cryptographic APIs, terminates processes to access locked data, and exfiltrates the information through webhooks and file uploads. The code's structure indicates malicious intent, with routines designed for covert data theft and exfiltration. The use of hardcoded webhooks, silent dependency installs, and process kills are typical of malware. The obfuscation level is moderate, with some regex patterns and encrypted routines, but overall the code is readable and straightforward in its malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a credential and data stealer with active process termination and covert exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=1, obfuscated around 0.3-0.5, and security risk=1—are justified and consistent with its behavior.",
