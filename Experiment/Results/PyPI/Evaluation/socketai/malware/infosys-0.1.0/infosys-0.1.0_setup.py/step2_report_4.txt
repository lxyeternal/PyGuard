  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- It defines static variables for package name, version, author info, package data, and setup parameters.\n- All values are hardcoded strings, with no dynamic code, user input, or external data.\n- Fields like 'author_email', 'maintainer', 'maintainer_email', and 'url' are set to 'None' as strings, which is acceptable placeholder practice.\n- No obfuscated code, no suspicious constructs, no code execution beyond calling `setup()`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging conventions.\n- **Malicious code or behavior:** None detected.\n- **Data flows or sinks:** Only static data assigned to variables and passed to `setup()`. No untrusted input, network activity, or data leaks.\n- **Errors or mistakes:** The use of 'None' as string literals in email and URL fields is unconventional but not malicious. It might be a placeholder.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\nThe reports uniformly conclude that this is a benign, standard setup script with no security issues. Their confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No report claims or implies any suspicious or malicious activity.\n- The only minor anomaly is the placeholder 'None' strings, which are typical in incomplete setup scripts but do not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code contains no malicious logic, no obfuscation, and no dynamic or external data handling.  \n- The placeholder values do not pose a security threat.  \n- The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThis is a benign, standard package setup script with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a security risk score of zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm that no hidden or obfuscated code exists elsewhere in the package.  \n- No further action needed based on this script alone.",
