{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and configuration for building and distributing a Python package named 'infosys'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package information, such as package list, package data, and setup parameters; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The data flows from static variables into the setup() function which executes the packaging process; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The email and URL fields are set to 'None', which is not unusual in placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and prepares package metadata using static variables. It calls setup() with predefined parameters. No input/output, network activity, or code execution beyond package configuration occurs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no code that could be used for supply chain attacks or malicious behavior.",
