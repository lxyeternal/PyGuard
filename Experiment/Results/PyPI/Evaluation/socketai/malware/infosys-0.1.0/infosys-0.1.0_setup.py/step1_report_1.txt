{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'infosys' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package configuration, including package name, version, author info, and package data.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; the setup configuration uses hardcoded static values.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the configuration simply assigns static values to setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The 'author_email' and 'maintainer_email' fields are set to 'None' as string literals, which is unconventional but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. All data appears to be hardcoded static strings with no external data sources or user input. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The script lacks any dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. It adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior are present. It appears safe and typical for open-source distribution.",
