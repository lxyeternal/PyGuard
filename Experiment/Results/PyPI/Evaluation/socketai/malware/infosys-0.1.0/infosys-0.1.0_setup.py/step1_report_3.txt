{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'infosys' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata and configuration data within the setup script.",
  "targets": "No explicit data sinks are present; the script only prepares package metadata for distribution.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs; the script uses hardcoded values for package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; author and maintainer fields contain placeholder values like 'None' and 'url' is also 'None'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script that defines package metadata. No dynamic input, no environment variable reads, and no code execution beyond calling setup() with static data. All values are hardcoded and typical for a package setup. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a normal, benign package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security issues.",
