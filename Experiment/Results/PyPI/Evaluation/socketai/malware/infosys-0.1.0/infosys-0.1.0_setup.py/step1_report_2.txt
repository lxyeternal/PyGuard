  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'infosys' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data such as package list, package data, and setup arguments.",
  "targets": "The setup function, which uses the provided parameters to build and distribute the package.",
  "flows": "Data is read from static variables (packages, package_data, setup_kwargs) and passed directly to the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and defines package metadata and data in static variables. These are passed directly to the setup() function without any modifications or dynamic evaluation. No input/output sources, network activity, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks detected.",
