{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, defining static package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data assignments for package name, version, author info, package data, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "The data is passed directly to the setup() function without external or untrusted input; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static source data flows directly into the setup() call without transformation or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'None' as string literals in email and URL fields is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code, user input, or external data sources. It contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The placeholder 'None' strings are typical in initial package configurations and do not pose security risks. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature. The analysis is consistent and thorough, with no logical flaws or overlooked issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a security risk score of zero.",
