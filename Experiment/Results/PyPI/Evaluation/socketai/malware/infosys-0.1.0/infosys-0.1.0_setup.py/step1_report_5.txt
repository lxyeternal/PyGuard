  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the Python package 'infosys'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' for setup functions; defines package list, package data, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is processed or transmitted; setup process involves no execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The setup script gathers package info and invokes setup(), with no untrusted data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder values such as 'author_email', 'maintainer_email', 'url' set to 'None', but these are typical placeholders and not malicious. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated parts are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module using setuptools. It specifies package details, dependencies, and metadata with no dynamic code, external input, or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The placeholders suggest incomplete setup info but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup configuration script for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious code or security risks.",
