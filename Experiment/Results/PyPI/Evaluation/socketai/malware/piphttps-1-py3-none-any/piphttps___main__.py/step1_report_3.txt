{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to extract sensitive user data, including Discord tokens, hardware information, and IP address, and then exfiltrate this data to an external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local filesystem paths for browser data, local state files, leveldb storage files, and network requests to obtain IP address, Discord tokens, and user information.",
  "sinks": "Sends gathered data (tokens, user info, hardware info, IP address) to a Discord webhook URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information without user consent.",
  "flows": "Reads tokens and decrypts them, then uses tokens to access Discord API for user info, which is then compiled with system info and sent via webhook to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Code comments and structure suggest intention to demonstrate only trusted packages, but actual behavior involves stealing Discord tokens and user data. The code includes obfuscated token extraction, sensitive API calls, and exfiltration, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is crafted as a token and data stealer targeting Discord users. It collects tokens from various browser and app data locations, decrypts them, and verifies their validity through Discord API requests. It also gathers system info like IP, username, and computer name. The script then constructs a detailed message with user info and exfiltrates it via a webhook, showing clear malicious behavior. No obfuscation or typical malware signatures are present beyond this data theft, but the purpose and actions are malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to steal Discord tokens and user information, then exfiltrate data to an attacker-controlled webhook, constituting malicious malware intended for privacy invasion and credential theft.",
