{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract stored tokens from various browsers and Discord-related applications, decrypt them, and send user information and tokens to a remote Discord webhook. It appears intended for malicious purposes such as token theft and data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads data from browser local storage files, environment variables, and system commands to gather tokens, system info, and user data.",
  "sinks": "Sends extracted tokens, user info, and system data to an external Discord webhook via HTTP POST requests.",
  "flows": "Reads tokens from local storage files -> decrypts tokens -> verifies tokens with Discord API -> collects user info and system data -> constructs message -> sends data to external webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, extensive token harvesting from multiple browsers, decryption of stored data, collection of system info (IP, username, PC name). The code uses Windows-specific commands and environment variables, indicating targeting Windows systems. The code includes comment indicating it is a demonstration of only downloading trusted packages, yet performs malicious data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports cryptographic and system modules, then defines functions to decrypt data, obtain IP address, get hardware ID, and extract tokens from various browser data directories. It decrypts stored encrypted tokens, verifies them via Discord API, and if valid, collects detailed user account info including email, phone, MFA status, Nitro subscription status, and system info (IP, username, PC name). All data is formatted into a message and sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The script is designed for malicious data exfiltration, primarily stealing Discord tokens and user data without user consent. It targets Windows systems and exploits local browser data storage to harvest tokens.",
  "conclusion": "This script is malicious; it functions as a token stealer and info exfiltration tool disguised as a demonstration of trusting packages. It collects sensitive user data and system info, then transmits it to an attacker's webhook. Its purpose and actions are malicious, and it should be considered malware with high security risk.",
