{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract stored tokens from various browsers, decrypt them, retrieve associated Discord user information, and exfiltrate this data to a remote webhook. It appears intended for malicious token theft and unauthorized data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads local browser data files, leveldb storage files, environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA), and network responses (IP address, Discord API).",
  "sinks": "Sends extracted tokens and user info via a Discord webhook (URL hardcoded).",
  "flows": "Extracts tokens from local files -> decrypts tokens -> verifies tokens via Discord API -> collects user and system info -> formats data -> exfiltrates via HTTP POST to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded webhook URL; extracts tokens by searching for specific patterns in leveldb files; decrypts tokens with Windows CryptUnprotectData API; exfiltrates sensitive data without user consent; combines data collection, decryption, and network transmission in one script. Also, the code comments and overall design imply malicious intent (token stealing).",
  "analysis": "The script loads browser data files across multiple browsers and gathers tokens. It decrypts the tokens using Windows API calls. It verifies tokens against Discord's API, then gathers user account details, including email, phone, MFA status, Nitro subscription status, and system info such as IP address, username, and PC name. All collected data is formatted into a message and sent to a Discord webhook URL, which is hardcoded. The script operates stealthily, aiming to exfiltrate sensitive user data without consent. The code is straightforward in its malicious intent, with no legitimate use case. The presence of token extraction, decryption, verification, and data exfiltration components confirms malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a token grabber targeting Discord users, exfiltrating sensitive account and system information to a remote webhook. It employs common malicious techniques such as token harvesting, decryption, API verification, and stealth data exfiltration. Overall, it clearly demonstrates malicious intent and poses a high security threat.",
