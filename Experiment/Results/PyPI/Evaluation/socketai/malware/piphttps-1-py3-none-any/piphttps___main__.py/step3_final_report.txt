{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract Discord tokens from browser storage, decrypt and validate them via Discord API, gather user and system information, and exfiltrate this data to a hardcoded webhook URL. It functions as a credential stealer and privacy-invasive malware.",
  "sources": "Local storage files of browsers (Chrome, Discord, Opera, etc.), environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA), LevelDB files, and Windows system commands (wmic).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a specified Discord webhook URL, transmitting user tokens, account info, IP address, hardware ID, and system details.",
  "flows": "Reads browser data -> Finds token patterns -> Decrypts tokens using Windows API -> Validates tokens via Discord API -> Collects user info and system info -> Formats data into a message -> Sends data to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses Windows-specific APIs for decryption, extensive token harvesting from multiple browsers, hardcoded webhook URL, and performs data exfiltration without user consent. No obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script explicitly performs malicious activities: it searches for stored Discord tokens across various browser directories, decrypts encrypted tokens with Windows API, verifies tokens through Discord API, and collects sensitive user and system information. It then exfiltrates this data to an attacker-controlled webhook URL. The code uses straightforward techniques without obfuscation, targeting Windows users. All behaviors align with typical credential-stealing malware. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and direct data exfiltration confirms malicious intent. The code's structure and actions are consistent with a credential stealer and privacy invasion tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious malware designed for credential theft, system info collection, and stealthy data exfiltration. It targets Windows environments, extracts sensitive data, and transmits it to an external webhook, posing a high security threat.",
