  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract stored tokens from various browsers and Discord-related applications, decrypt them, and send the user information along with tokens to a remote webhook. It appears to be used for malicious token theft and exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading Local State files for encryption keys, reading leveldb storage files for token-like patterns, environment variables for user info, network requests to external APIs (IP, Discord API), subprocess output for hardware ID.",
  "sinks": "Sending stolen tokens, user info, and hardware details via a Discord webhook to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Extract tokens from browser files and local storage -> decrypt tokens -> verify tokens via Discord API -> gather user/system info -> send all collected data to remote webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64 decoding and AES decryption with 'CryptUnprotectData', which is common in malicious token grabbers. It accesses multiple browser profiles, reads leveldb files, and extracts token-like strings using regex, which indicates suspicious activity. The code also immediately exfiltrates sensitive info to an external webhook, which is typical malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs credential harvesting by scanning local browser data and Discord files for tokens. It decrypts and validates tokens via Discord API calls. It then gathers system information such as IP, username, PC name, and hardware UUID. The script constructs a detailed embed message containing all the stolen data and exfiltrates it via a Discord webhook. The usage of CryptUnprotectData, decryption routines, and the immediate data exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent. No legitimate purpose for such operations is provided, and the code does not contain any protective or benign features.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a malicious token and data stealer targeting Discord tokens and user information, exfiltrating data to a remote webhook. It demonstrates clear malicious behavior with no legitimate use case. It is highly dangerous and should be regarded as malware.",
