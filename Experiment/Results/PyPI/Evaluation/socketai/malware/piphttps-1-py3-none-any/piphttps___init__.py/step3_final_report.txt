  "purpose": "A simple demonstration function that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The function 'hello()' which outputs a static string; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to the console; no untrusted data or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input source (none) directly leads to the print sink; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that prints a static message. It contains no external dependencies, input handling, or network activity. The code is minimal, clear, and serves as a benign demonstration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward analysis. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, non-malicious demonstration function with no security concerns. All reports and scores are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
