{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'pytagora' for distribution on package repositories like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded strings in the setup() function parameters such as name, version, license, description, author, author_email, url, download_url, keywords, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code merely defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded strings in the setup() call to the package metadata used during distribution; no dynamic data or external input flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns identified. Usage of standard setup() from distutils is typical for package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using distutils. It contains static metadata definitions with no dynamic or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious logic are present. The script's purpose is to facilitate package distribution, and all components appear benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use for publishing the 'pytagora' package.",
