{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for 'pytagora' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, author info, URL, download URL, keywords, classifiers, and dependencies from hardcoded strings and lists.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak to external systems.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static configuration data is used to configure package setup, with no external input or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is standard for a setup script using distutils.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration using distutils. It specifies package metadata, license, author info, URLs, classifiers, and dependencies. All data is static and hardcoded. There are no dynamic imports, user inputs, or suspicious code patterns. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration file for packaging a Python project.",
