  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'pytagora' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration data, no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard distutils setup without obfuscated or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core' for package setup, providing static package metadata such as name, version, license, author info, URL, download URL, keywords, dependencies, and classifiers. There is no user input, no dynamic code execution, nor any external data fetching or processing. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup configuration with standard fields.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only contains static configuration data used for packaging and distribution.",
