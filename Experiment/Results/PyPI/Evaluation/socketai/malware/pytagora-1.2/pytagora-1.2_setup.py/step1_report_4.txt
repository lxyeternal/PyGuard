{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pytagora' for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded strings within the setup() function parameters, such as package name, version, author info, URLs, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks are present; the code does not send data over the network or write to files. It solely defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the flow is static, from hardcoded values to the package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. All parameters are standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration file using distutils. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. There are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code only performs static configuration, which is standard in packaging workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate setup script for distributing a Python package.",
