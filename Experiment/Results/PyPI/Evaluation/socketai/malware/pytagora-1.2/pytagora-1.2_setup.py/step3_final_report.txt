  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using distutils for packaging metadata.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, url, download_url, keywords, classifiers, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; static configuration with no external input or data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script utilizing distutils.core.setup with hardcoded, static metadata. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. All signals point to benign intent. The static nature and absence of network activity, code execution, or secrets indicate no malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately assess the code's safety, and the scores are justified and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
