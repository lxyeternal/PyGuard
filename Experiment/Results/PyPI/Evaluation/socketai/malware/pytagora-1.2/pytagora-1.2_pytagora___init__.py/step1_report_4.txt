  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'functions', but no further actions are taken within the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'functions' module; no other input or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; importing a module without further context is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a module named 'functions'. Without additional context or code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The import itself does not pose a risk, and the absence of further logic limits the ability to identify suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is minimal and does not exhibit any signs of malware or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent.",
