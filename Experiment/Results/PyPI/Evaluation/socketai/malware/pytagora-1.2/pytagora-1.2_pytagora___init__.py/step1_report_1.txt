{
  "purpose": "Importing functions module, likely to utilize external or user-defined functions within the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports the entire functions module, which may contain data inputs or external data processing.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues; no data processing or output operations shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible beyond the import statement; since no further code is provided, no source-to-sink flow is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of an import statement with no additional logic, which is unusual as a standalone snippet and offers limited context. No signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a module named 'functions'. There are no functions, variables, or data processing present. Without further context, there are no detectable security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalies. This minimal code snippet alone cannot demonstrate malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no observable malicious activity or security concerns. Due to lack of additional code, the analysis is limited, and the risk is considered very low.",
