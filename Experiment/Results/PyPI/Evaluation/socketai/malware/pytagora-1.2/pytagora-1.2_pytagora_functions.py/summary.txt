  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed payloads that connect to external servers, indicating malicious intent. The use of 'exec()' on encoded data is a significant security concern, and the decoded payload's network activity confirms high suspicion. The scores of malware (~1), obfuscation (~1), and security risk (~1) are justified. This package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious."
