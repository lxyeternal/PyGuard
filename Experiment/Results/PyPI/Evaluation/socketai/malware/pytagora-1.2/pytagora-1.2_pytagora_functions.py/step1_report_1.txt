  "purpose": "Calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle and perform additional mathematical operations, with an embedded obfuscated code execution.",
  "sources": "Base64-decoded exec statement, which executes dynamically decoded code.",
  "sinks": "exec function executing decoded code; no other clear data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Code decodes base64 string -> executes it via exec -> can run arbitrary code; other functions perform mathematical calculations without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code executed through exec; code appears obfuscated and potentially malicious, as it decodes and runs hidden instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules math, base64, and sys. The hello() function decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically with exec(). The base64 string, when decoded, contains Python code that imports socket and other modules, connects to a hardcoded IP and port, possibly for command and control purposes. The functions hypotenuse and other perform mathematical calculations without external inputs or side effects. The exec statement is a strong indicator of malicious intent due to dynamic code execution of obfuscated code. No other suspicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials within the visible code is detected, but the embedded code is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious code executed via exec(), likely intended to connect to external servers or perform unauthorized actions. The mathematical functions themselves are benign but serve as cover for the malicious payload. Overall, this package demonstrates high malicious potential.",
