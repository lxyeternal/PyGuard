  "purpose": "Calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle and a secondary calculation involving the hypotenuse and another value.",
  "sources": "Reading input from function parameters; executing code decoded from a base64 string.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded code; the code executed may be malicious.",
  "flows": "The base64 decoded code is executed when hello() is called; subsequent calculations do not involve untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on decoded base64 string; the decoded string appears obfuscated and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for mathematical calculations. The hello() function decodes a base64 string and executes it via exec(). The decoded code is hidden, potentially malicious, and could perform harmful actions such as network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The mathematical functions themselves are standard and do not contain malicious behavior. The execution of external, obfuscated code via exec() is a significant security concern, especially since the string is not transparent or verified. No other suspicious patterns like hardcoded credentials or unsafe data handling are present outside the exec() call.",
  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the execution of obfuscated code via exec() with a base64-encoded payload. This introduces high risk, as the decoded code could be malicious, backdoored, or perform harmful actions. The rest of the code appears benign. Overall, the presence of exec() on encoded data is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
