  "sinks": "exec() with dynamically decoded code, potentially executing malicious code",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> exec() -> execution of embedded code",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with base64-encoded payload, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and potentially malicious intent; the code within the decoded payload is hidden and not transparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for geometric calculations. The 'hello()' function contains an exec() call with a base64-encoded string, which is decoded and executed dynamically. The payload is hidden and not visible in the plain code, raising suspicion. The main functions 'hypotenuse()' and 'other()' perform mathematical operations and call 'hello()', thus executing the obfuscated code whenever these functions are invoked. The use of exec() with encoded data is a common technique for hiding malicious payloads or backdoors. No other external inputs or insecure operations are apparent, but the presence of obfuscated code executed at runtime is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated malicious activity through the use of exec() with a base64-encoded payload. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, as the payload could perform any harmful actions. The rest of the code appears benign but is used to invoke the malicious payload. This package should be treated with suspicion and reviewed further for actual malicious behavior.",
