  "purpose": "Calculate the hypotenuse and other side lengths of right-angled triangles; includes obfuscated code execution.",
  "sources": "Base64 encoded string decoded and executed via exec() inside the hello() function.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing dynamically decoded code; no other explicit sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Base64 string decoded in hello() → exec() executes the decoded code, then functions perform mathematical calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and exec() indicates obfuscation and potential malicious behavior. The decoded code appears to connect to socket.io and perform network operations, which could be malicious. No visible input handling; hardcoded obfuscated code is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: hello() and hypotenuse(). The hello() function decodes a base64 string and executes it with exec(). The decoded code, upon analysis, appears to establish socket.io connections, likely to communicate with a remote server. The use of exec() with dynamically decoded code is a high risk indicator, as it can run malicious payloads. The math functions themselves are benign but are used in a context that includes obfuscated code execution. The overall structure suggests an attempt at concealment and remote command execution capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated execution via base64 decoding and exec(), which likely executes malicious remote code. The mathematical functions are benign, but the presence of dynamic code execution and network connection code makes this suspicious. The overall risk is high due to obfuscation and potential malicious behavior.",
