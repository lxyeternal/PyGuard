{
  "purpose": "The code calculates the hypotenuse and another related value of a right triangle, and contains an obfuscated function call likely to perform hidden operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses function parameters and base64-decoded content within the 'hello' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes decoded base64 code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the content is malicious.",
  "flows": "The 'hello' function is called within 'hypotenuse', executing decoded code, which could potentially run malicious instructions. The other functions perform mathematical calculations without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded code executed via 'exec' is suspicious; it suggests hidden or malicious behavior. The decoded code appears to include network or system operations, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines functions for mathematical calculations. The 'hello' function decodes base64 data and executes it dynamically, which is a common technique to obfuscate malicious code. The 'hypotenuse' function calls 'hello', leading to execution of potentially malicious code. The 'other' function performs a calculation with no external input or side effects. The use of 'exec' with decoded content is a significant anomaly indicating possible malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the use of 'exec' on decoded base64 content, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent or backdoor functionality. The mathematical functions themselves are benign, but the obfuscated code execution warrants suspicion and should be reviewed further. Overall, this package poses a high security risk.",
