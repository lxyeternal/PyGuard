  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, file reads, or network requests if present (none explicitly shown in the provided code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, file writes, network transmissions, or database operations, but none are explicitly demonstrated here.",
  "flows": "Without explicit source and sink operations in the code snippet, no clear data flow paths are identifiable.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward and lacks signs of malicious intent or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The provided code lacks any explicit input handling, output operations, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a benign utility or logic implementation. There are no indicators of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware functionalities. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious library usage, or risky patterns. The overall structure is simple and consistent with standard coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no indicators of malware, data leakage, or supply chain attacks. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
