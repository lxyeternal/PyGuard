  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or manipulation, potentially with external data sources or inputs.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external libraries, or network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points such as network transmissions, file writes, or execution of system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, possibly involving dynamic code execution or data serialization.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, obfuscated code, or unusual use of eval/exec functions, dynamic imports, or other risky constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical malware indicators such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration. No such patterns or malicious code snippets were identified. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests no obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's structure and variable names do not indicate hidden functionality. There is no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network communication. The overall design appears consistent with legitimate data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign implementation without any obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
