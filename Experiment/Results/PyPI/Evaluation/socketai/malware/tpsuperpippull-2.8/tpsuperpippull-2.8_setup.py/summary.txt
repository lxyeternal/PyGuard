  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious potential due to execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during package setup, with indicators of stealth and obfuscation. The behavior aligns with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, with high malware (around 0.85), obfuscation (around 0.9), and security risk (around 0.9). It should be treated as malicious or compromised until further analysis confirms benign intent."
