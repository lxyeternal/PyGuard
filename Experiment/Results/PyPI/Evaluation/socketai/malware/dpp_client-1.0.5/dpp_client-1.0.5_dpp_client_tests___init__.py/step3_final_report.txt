  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on source-to-sink data flows, anomalies, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, network requests, file I/O, and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, environment variables, and external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and network requests feed into processing functions, with outputs potentially sent over network or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard libraries for network and environment handling, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Data flows from sources like environment variables and network requests to sinks such as network endpoints and files. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of malicious indicators, backdoors, or obfuscation. The overall security posture is low risk, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a conservative security risk score of 0.2. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.85), given the straightforward analysis and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities detected. The low security risk score reflects cautious assessment due to limited context but no evidence of threats. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the overall security posture is considered safe.",
