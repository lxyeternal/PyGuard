{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for general data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and function parameters. It also imports modules which may access system resources or network.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that write to files, send data over network, or execute system commands, but specific sink usage cannot be confirmed without detailed code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or parameters through various functions, possibly ending at output functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or suspicious dynamic code execution is detected. The code's structure and variable naming are standard, with no signs of obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library imports and straightforward functions. Without explicit malicious functions or hidden code, it appears benign. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. Due to lack of detailed context or obfuscated sections, confidence is moderate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform typical utility or processing tasks with no suspicious indicators.",
