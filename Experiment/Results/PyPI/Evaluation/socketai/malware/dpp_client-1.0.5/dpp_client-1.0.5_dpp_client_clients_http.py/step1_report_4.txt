{
  "purpose": "Defines a client class for sending event data to a specified endpoint via HTTP POST requests.",
  "sources": "The endpoint URL (endpoint parameter), input data in the _send_event method (event_data, timestamp, event_type).",
  "sinks": "The self.session.post call which sends data over the network, potentially exposing data if endpoint or data is maliciously manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (endpoint, event_data, timestamp, event_type) flow into the _send_event method, which constructs a data payload and transmits it via POST request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; use of standard requests library without unusual patterns; no obfuscation detected; no dynamic code execution or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a client class that sends event data to a specified endpoint using the requests library. It formats timestamps, manages a session with optional adapter configurations, and transmits data via POST. All inputs are standard parameters; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. The code performs network communication securely with error handling via resp.raise_for_status(). There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The structure is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard HTTP client for event reporting with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present.",
