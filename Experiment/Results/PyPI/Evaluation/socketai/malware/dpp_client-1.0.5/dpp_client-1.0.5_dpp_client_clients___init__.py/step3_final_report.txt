  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external files, network connections, subprocesses, dynamic imports.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, subprocess executions, eval/exec calls, dynamic code loading.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into eval/exec, network, or file operations, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, dynamic imports, minimal comments, signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with suspicious patterns such as eval/exec and obfuscated variables, indicating potential malicious intent. Benign code lacks such patterns. The scores assigned reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores justified for suspicious code. Benign reports show no suspicious activity, with low security risk scores. Slight adjustments to risk scores for benign reports could improve consistency, but overall scores align with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The report with obfuscated, dynamically loaded code (Report 4) shows significant signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, warranting further review. Benign reports are appropriately scored with minimal risk. The current scoring system is consistent with the observed behaviors.",
