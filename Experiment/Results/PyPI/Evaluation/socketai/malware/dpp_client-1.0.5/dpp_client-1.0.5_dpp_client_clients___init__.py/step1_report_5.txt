  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard Python functions or utilities, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the environment, function parameters, or data files, depending on the implementation details which are not visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or environment variable access, but specific locations cannot be pinpointed without the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through various processing functions towards sinks, possibly involving transformations or conditional logic; precise flows cannot be established without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs can be identified without the code content. The structure and format appear typical.",
  "analysis": "Given the absence of the actual code snippet, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The review process involves checking for suspicious imports, unusual functions, or hidden behaviors, but no such details are available.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information is provided to conduct a meaningful security review. Based on the lack of code, there is no detectable malicious behavior or security risk. Please provide the specific code for further analysis.",
