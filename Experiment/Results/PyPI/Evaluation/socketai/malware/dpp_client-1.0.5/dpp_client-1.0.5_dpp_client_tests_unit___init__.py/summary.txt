  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion without confirmed malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a cautious stance justified by the potential for hidden malicious behavior. Further runtime or static analysis is recommended to confirm or refute these suspicions."
