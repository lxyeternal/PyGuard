  "purpose": "Provides an abstract base class for event handling with validation and logging, delegating actual event transmission to subclasses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: event_type, timestamp, event_data, optional logger, optional timeout",
  "sinks": "Logging statements output event details; potential exposure if event_data contains sensitive info",
  "flows": "send_event method validates inputs, logs event details, then calls _send_event with provided data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard validation, logging, and abstract method pattern; no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, benign abstract class for event handling. It performs proper validation on event_type and timestamp, uses logging for debugging, and delegates event sending to subclasses. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The logging of event data could pose a risk if sensitive data is included, but this is a common practice. No signs of obfuscation or malware are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate; the minimal risk stems from logging practices, not code flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard abstract class with no malicious intent or security flaws. The scoring in the reports is accurate; the low risk score is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
