  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for sending events with validation and logging",
  "sources": "Input parameters: event_type, event_data, timestamp, timeout, logger",
  "sinks": "Logging statements that output event details; no other sinks are present",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then passed to the _send_event method; logs are generated before and after sending",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements an abstract class for event handling, performing validation on event types and timestamps, with logging for debugging. It ensures input types and values are correct, and delegates actual sending to subclasses. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, secure abstract base class for event dispatching with proper validation and logging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
