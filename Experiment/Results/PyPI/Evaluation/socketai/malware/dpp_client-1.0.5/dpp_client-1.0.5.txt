      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code performs covert exfiltration of environment variables and directory listing data during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The behavior is suspicious, especially given the external URL and timing, and warrants high malware and security risk scores. The current reports' assessments are justified, but the malware score could be slightly moderated to reflect the absence of payloads or obfuscation. Overall, this package poses a significant security threat due to data exfiltration during installation."

The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a moderate security concern mainly related to obfuscation techniques without confirmed malicious payloads."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the slight security risk reflects the transmission of unvalidated data over the network, which is typical for such clients. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts, with no indicators of malicious behavior."

The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the overall security posture is considered safe."
