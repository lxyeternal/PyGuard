  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior indicative of potential malware, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup with error suppression. The high obfuscation and stealthy execution justify elevated malware and security risk scores. Further decoding and analysis of the PowerShell payload are recommended to confirm malicious intent."
