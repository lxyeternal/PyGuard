  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command that downloads and potentially executes malicious payloads during package installation. The behavior, obfuscation, and embedded URL strongly suggest malicious intent. The scores assigned are consistent with the evidence, and the overall threat level is high. This package should be flagged for further investigation and considered malicious or at least malicious-suspect."
