{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and conditionally executes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command during installation, likely for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or payload download.",
  "sources": "Filesystem check for 'tahg' directory; execution of subprocess with base64-encoded PowerShell command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess executes a PowerShell command that could download or run malicious code, potentially connecting to suspicious domains.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check -> If absent, execute encoded PowerShell command via subprocess -> Silent error handling suppresses failures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded, silently executed PowerShell command during setup; silent exception suppression; presence of suspicious URL comment; obfuscation of payload.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup but includes a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently when 'tahg' does not exist. The command is encoded in base64, making it difficult to analyze directly, but its execution during setup and the presence of a suspicious URL strongly suggest malicious intent. Silent error handling further conceals potential failures. The pattern matches common supply chain attack techniques, indicating high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed during package installation, indicating malicious activity with high confidence. The silent execution, obfuscation, and suspicious URL strongly suggest the package is compromised or malicious.",
