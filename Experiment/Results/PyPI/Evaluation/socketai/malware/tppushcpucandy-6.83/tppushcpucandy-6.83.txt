      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, hidden execution of a PowerShell command with a suspicious external URL, indicative of malicious activity. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware delivery, backdoors, or remote control. The high scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.9, security risk ~0.9) are justified. It is recommended to treat this package as malicious until further decoding and analysis confirm safety."
