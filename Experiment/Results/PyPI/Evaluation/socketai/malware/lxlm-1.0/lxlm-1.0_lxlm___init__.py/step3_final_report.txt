  "purpose": "A minimal placeholder Python function that prints a static string, with no input sources, data flows, or external dependencies.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that prints a static string. It contains no input sources, data flows, external dependencies, or malicious constructs. The simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior indicate it is benign. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal placeholder with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and the scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
