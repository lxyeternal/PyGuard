{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it also contains code that downloads and executes an external executable, which is suspicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from a URL ('https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe') using requests.get(). The URL is hardcoded and points to a raw executable file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the downloaded content to a file named 'tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe' and then executes it via os.system('start ' + filename), which runs the executable on Windows.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL (source) through requests.get() into a file (sink), then the system executes the file (sink), enabling remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include the code actively downloading and executing an executable during the setup process, which is highly suspicious. The URL points to a binary executable rather than a typical setup script or package component. The code only runs on Windows ('win32') and exits otherwise, which limits visibility but does not justify such behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a standard shebang and imports. The zzr() function checks for Windows platform and downloads a remote executable file, then executes it immediately. This is embedded within a setup script for a package named 'lxlm'. The rest of the setup code appears normal but is overshadowed by the malicious download and execution segment. The code's primary purpose seems to be to silently download and run an external binary, which is typical of malware or supply chain attacks. The use of a public URL hosting a raw executable, and the immediate execution, indicate malicious intent, potentially allowing remote control or compromise of the host system. The rest of the code appears legitimate but is rendered dangerous by the embedded malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains clear malicious behavior—downloading and executing an external binary during package setup. This strongly suggests an attempt to infect or control systems where this package is installed. The setup code itself appears legitimate but is compromised by embedded malware. Overall, this package is highly unsafe to use.",
