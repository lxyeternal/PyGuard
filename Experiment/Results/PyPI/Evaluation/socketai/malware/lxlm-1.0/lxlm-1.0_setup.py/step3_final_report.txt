{
  "purpose": "The code downloads and executes a remote Windows executable during setup, indicating malicious intent aimed at executing arbitrary code on the target system.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe' via requests.get(), triggered within the zzr() function.",
  "sinks": "The open() function writing to a file, followed by os.system('start ' + filename), which executes the downloaded binary.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves the executable; open() writes it to disk; os.system() executes the binary, all within the zzr() function called at script start.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URL pointing to a suspicious executable, immediate execution without validation, platform check restricting to Windows, and execution during setup script runtime.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a malicious supply chain attack by downloading and executing an external executable during package setup, which is highly dangerous. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the malicious payload is embedded directly. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the high severity warrants maximum malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, acting as a backdoor or malware delivery vector. It compromises system integrity by executing remote code during setup. The embedded behavior is clear and deliberate, with no obfuscation or ambiguity. The package should be considered unsafe and flagged as malicious.",
