{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains malicious code that downloads and executes an external executable.",
  "sources": "The function zzr() reads data from a remote URL using requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The open() function writes the downloaded content to a file, and os.system() executes the downloaded file, which could be malicious.",
  "flows": "The code downloads content from the specified URL, writes it to a file, then immediately executes that file, creating a source-to-sink flow that executes remote code.",
  "anomalies": "The script contains a function zzr() that downloads and executes a binary from a GitHub URL only on Windows. The URL points to an executable, and the immediate execution indicates malicious intent. The filename is generic and temporary, designed to obscure its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing modules, then defines zzr() which checks if the platform is Windows. If so, it downloads an executable from a GitHub URL, saves it with a temporary filename, and executes it. This is suspicious, as it could install malware. The setup() function, typical for package configuration, is present but is likely used to disguise malicious behavior as a legitimate package. The presence of a hardcoded URL, combined with immediate execution of downloaded content, strongly indicates malicious intent. No other suspicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to download and execute a remote executable on Windows systems, representing a high security risk. It appears to be a supply chain attack embedded within a setup script, masquerading as a legitimate package configuration.",
