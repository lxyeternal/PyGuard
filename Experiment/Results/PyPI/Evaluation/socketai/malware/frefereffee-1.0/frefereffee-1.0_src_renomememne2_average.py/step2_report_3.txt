  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is extremely simple: two functions, with no external input/output, no data flows, and no actual usage of the imported libraries.\n- The imports ('urllib3' and 'pyaes') are unused in all cases.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1), which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code issues:** The code does not contain any bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. The functions are trivial.\n- **Unused imports:** All reports correctly note that 'urllib3' and 'pyaes' are imported but not used. This could be benign or incomplete code, but no malicious intent is indicated.\n- **Data flows:** None exist from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the unused imports, which are benign in this context.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (~0.1), which is reasonable given the unused imports; no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Critical review:\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and sound.\n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.\n- No report claims or implies malicious activity, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to unused imports but no actual threat)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns. The unused imports are likely just leftovers or placeholders, not indicators of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed. The code is harmless, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
