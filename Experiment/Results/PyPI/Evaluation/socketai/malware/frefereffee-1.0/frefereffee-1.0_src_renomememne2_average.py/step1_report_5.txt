{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions for calculating the integer average of a list and returning a string 'lol'. It also imports external libraries urllib3 and pyaes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for urllib3 and pyaes; function calcAverage reading input list; function lol returning a constant string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions do not process external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Imported libraries (urllib3, pyaes) are not used within the code; no malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets present; functions are straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two external libraries that are not used, which could indicate unused dependencies or potential for malicious use if misused elsewhere. The functions themselves are simple and do not perform any network operations, data processing, or encryption that could be malicious. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks. The unused imports do not constitute a security threat but could be flagged for cleanup or review. Overall, no suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
