  "purpose": "The code defines two simple functions: one calculates the integer average of a list, and the other returns a static string 'lol'. It imports 'urllib3' and 'pyaes' but does not utilize them.",
  "sources": "Imports 'urllib3' and 'pyaes' (unused in the code).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; functions are self-contained with no external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of unused imports; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The unused imports are benign and common in scaffolded or incomplete code. No data flows or external communications are present. The functions perform trivial operations without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The unused imports do not indicate malicious behavior but could be placeholders for future features. The overall security risk is minimal.",
