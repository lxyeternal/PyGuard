{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script that provides a function to calculate the integer average of a list and another function returning a static string.",
  "sources": "The code imports external libraries 'urllib3' and 'pyaes', which could potentially be used for network communication or encryption.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data output, network communication, or data storage is performed within the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions do not process external input or produce output based on external data.",
  "anomalies": "The imports 'urllib3' and 'pyaes' are unused, which could be benign or a sign of incomplete code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident. The functions are straightforward with no complex or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions: one calculates an integer average of a list, the other returns a static string. The imported libraries are not used within the code, which could suggest incomplete code or potential misuse if further code were added. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The code structure is simple and clear, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. The unused imports do not indicate malicious activity but could be scrutinized if additional context shows they are used elsewhere. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not pose security concerns.",
