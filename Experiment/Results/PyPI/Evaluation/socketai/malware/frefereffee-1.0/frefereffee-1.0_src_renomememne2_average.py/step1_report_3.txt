{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform basic utility functions, such as calculating an average and returning a string.",
  "sources": "Imports: urllib3 and pyaes libraries; no other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No flow from sources to sinks is observed; the functions do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are detected. The imported libraries are not used within the code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports urllib3 and pyaes but does not utilize them in any function. The calcAverage function performs integer division, which is normal. The lol function simply returns a static string. There are no dynamic executions, data transmissions, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs simple utility functions, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The imported libraries are unused, indicating the code is likely incomplete or part of a larger, benign project.",
