{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious stealer designed to extract sensitive user data such as browser credentials, cookies, history, Discord tokens, system information, and files from various applications and system directories, then exfiltrate and upload this data to external servers.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user directories (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.), browser data folders, start menu shortcuts, system commands (systeminfo, getmac), clipboard, and network responses. The code also reads configuration files and registry entries related to system and application states.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing stolen data into files within temporary folders, compressing and archiving data, uploading data via HTTP requests to external services (gofile.io, anonfiles.com), and sending data to Telegram via API. It also executes system commands that can modify system behavior, such as disabling Defender, blocking websites, or executing malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like browser databases, user directories, system info commands, clipboard, and shortcuts; these are processed and collected into structured data. The collected data is then archived and uploaded to external servers. Certain system manipulations, such as injecting code into Discord or launching bound executables, create additional flows that could allow persistent backdoors or remote control.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include: attempting to disable Windows Defender, injecting malicious JavaScript into Discord, creating mutexes to prevent multiple instances, running processes in hidden or sandboxed modes, self-deletion, manipulating startup entries, fake error popups, and unconditionally executing all data collection routines without user consent. Hardcoded base64-encoded URLs and command strings indicate obfuscation and malicious intent. The presence of sleep delays and looping retries further suggest stealth activities.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a malicious data stealer and backdoor. It collects browser credentials, cookies, history, autofills, and system information; steals cryptocurrency wallets, gaming session files, and application data; captures webcam images and clipboard data; blocks security and antivirus sites; injects backdoor JavaScript into Discord; and exfiltrates all gathered data to external servers or Telegram. It also attempts to disable or evade system protections, create persistence (via startup entries or hidden files), and avoid detection through various stealth techniques. The functions are wrapped with error handling to ensure continuous operation, and many system commands and file manipulations are performed with minimal user interaction or awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior, designed to silently extract and transmit sensitive information, manipulate system security features, and establish persistence. Its obfuscation and comprehensive data theft tactics confirm it is malware intended for unauthorized access, privacy invasion, and potential system damage. It should be classified as highly malicious and dangerous, and should not be used or trusted under any circumstances.",
