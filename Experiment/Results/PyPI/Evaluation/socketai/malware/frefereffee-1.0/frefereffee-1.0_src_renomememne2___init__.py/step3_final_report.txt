  "purpose": "Assessment of minimal import statements for potential malicious behavior or security risks in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for urllib3 and pyaes, which are read at the start of the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data flows are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to the absence of executable code beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only standard library imports with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements for urllib3 and pyaes, both standard libraries. There is no executable logic, data flow, or suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting potential misuse if these modules are used maliciously in a larger context, but no evidence exists here. Confidence is high (around 0.8), given the simplicity of the code. The scores are consistent with the minimal and benign nature of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statements, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or score adjustments are necessary unless additional code demonstrates malicious behavior.",
