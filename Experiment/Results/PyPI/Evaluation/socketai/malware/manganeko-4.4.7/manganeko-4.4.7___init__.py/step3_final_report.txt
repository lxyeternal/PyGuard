{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function 'ina()' that prints 'installed' and is invoked immediately, serving as a basic status indicator or log message.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes a print statement with static content.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function call that outputs a message. No external data is read, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The logic is sound, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scoring appropriately reflects the harmless nature of this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
