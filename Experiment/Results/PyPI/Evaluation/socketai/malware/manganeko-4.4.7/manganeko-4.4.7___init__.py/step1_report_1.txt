{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function that prints a message indicating installation status and then calls that function.",
  "sources": "The function call 'ina()' which triggers the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement is a sink that outputs to standard output.",
  "flows": "The function 'ina' is called directly after its definition, causing the print statement to execute.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and simple: it defines a function 'ina' that prints a message. Immediately after, it calls 'ina()', resulting in the message 'installed' being printed. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The code appears benign and is likely used for a basic status indication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, consisting solely of a simple print statement within a function, invoked immediately. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns present.",
