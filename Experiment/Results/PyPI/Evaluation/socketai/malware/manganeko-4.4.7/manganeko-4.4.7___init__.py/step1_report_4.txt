{
  "purpose": "The code defines and calls a simple function that prints a message indicating installation status.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output using print(), which is not a security sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from any source to a sink; the function merely outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function 'ina' that prints a static string 'installed' and is immediately invoked. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no complex logic. It does not perform any network operations, file I/O beyond printing, or use of environment variables. No indicators of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and does not contain malicious behavior. It appears to be a basic notification function with no security concerns.",
