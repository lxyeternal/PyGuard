{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate environment information, download a potentially malicious executable, and execute it during package installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable; making HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an external executable file via os.system; sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variable and network request -> Sink: download and execute payload.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling with try/except pass; downloading and executing an unverified external file during setup; exfiltration of environment info.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves environment info, exfiltrates it via HTTP GET, downloads an executable from a suspicious URL, and executes it silently during installation. The straightforward code structure indicates malicious activity, with no obfuscation. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential failures. The behavior aligns with typical supply chain malware, actively compromising system integrity. Scores assigned in reports (0.9 to 1 for malware and security risk) are justified; however, given the explicit malicious actions, the malware and risk scores should be set to 1 for clarity and severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior involving data exfiltration, remote payload download, and execution during package installation. The activity is active, intentional, and highly dangerous, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, this package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly.",
