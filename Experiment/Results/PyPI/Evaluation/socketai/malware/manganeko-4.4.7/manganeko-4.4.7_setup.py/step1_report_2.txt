{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup utility for a Python package named 'manganeko', with additional code that executes during installation to perform network requests and potentially malicious file downloads.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (via os.environ['COMPUTERNAME']) and network requests to external URLs (via requests.get).",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing a file from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' using os.system, which executes the downloaded file on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "Reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> sends data to 'linkedopports.com' via HTTP GET request -> downloads executable from 'python-release.com' -> executes the downloaded file using os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Code performs network communication during package installation, sending environment info to an external server, then downloads and executes an external executable, which is unusual and suspicious behavior for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable. It then makes a GET request to an external URL, sending this info. If running on Windows ('win32'), it downloads an executable file from a suspicious domain and executes it. The 'PostInstallCommand' class runs this 'send' function during package installation. The setup configuration registers this custom install command, causing the malicious activity to trigger during package install. Such behavior indicates active malicious intent, including data exfiltration and remote code execution, which are typical of supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system info and downloads/executed potentially harmful payloads during package installation. This is indicative of malicious intent and poses a high security risk.",
