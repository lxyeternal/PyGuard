It then downloads an executable file from a questionable domain and executes it immediately using os.system. This behavior is triggered during the post-installation process of the package, which could lead to malicious code execution on the user's system. The use of broad exception handling obscures potential errors and conceals malicious activity. These actions are characteristic of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior intended to compromise user systems.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code exhibits malicious intent by exfiltrating environment data and executing an external binary during package installation. This indicates a high security risk and potential malware behavior designed to compromise the target system.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0.9,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.9\n}",
