  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'manganeko' package, with additional behavior triggered during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME'; external URL requests via requests.get; file download and execution via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URL; downloading and executing a file on Windows systems.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP GET request to linkedopports.com -> Downloaded file ('ini_file_pyp_32.exe') -> executed with os.system('start ...')",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional external data transmission based on environment variable; downloading and executing potentially malicious executable during installation; use of broad exception handling that suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes an HTTP request to a suspicious domain with this info. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a potentially malicious URL and executes it. The exception handling suppresses all errors, making detection difficult. The setup process triggers this 'send' function during installation via a custom command class. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate data and run arbitrary code during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment information and executing a downloaded executable without user consent. It poses a significant security risk and should be considered malicious or compromised.",
