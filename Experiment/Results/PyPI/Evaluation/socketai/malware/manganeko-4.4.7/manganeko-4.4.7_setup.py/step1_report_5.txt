  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script with post-install behavior that downloads and executes an external file.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URL requests (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php and https://python-release.com/python-install.scr)",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing downloaded executable 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe'",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' + request to linkedopports.com -> request to python-release.com -> save executable -> execute via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling; downloading and executing external executable during installation; unverified external URLs; environment variable used to personalize request; executing downloaded file without validation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and makes requests to potentially malicious URLs. If the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it immediately, which indicates malicious intent. The use of exception handling suppresses errors, possibly to hide malicious activity. The 'PostInstallCommand' class runs this 'send' function after installation, meaning the malicious code executes during package installation. The setup configuration ties the custom command to the installation process. Overall, this behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, such as executing arbitrary code from an external source.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, likely intended to compromise the user's system. The suspicious URLs, environment variable usage, and execution of downloaded code strongly suggest malicious intent.",
