{
  "purpose": "Set up and install a Python package named 'manganeko' with custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', making HTTP requests to external URLs, reading from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external servers, downloading and executing an executable file via os.system.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> HTTP request to https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ... -> download executable from https://python-release.com/python-install.scr -> execute downloaded file via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code retrieves sensitive environment info and sends it to a remote server; downloads an executable and runs it without validation; uses broad exception handling that suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a 'send' function that reads the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, then makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, passing the environment variable. If running on Windows, it downloads an executable from a potentially malicious source and executes it silently. The 'send' function is invoked during post-installation via a custom install command, which is typical but in this context used to perform covert operations. The use of broad try-except blocks suppresses errors, hiding potential issues. The code’s behavior—sending environment info and executing remote payload—suggests malicious intent, likely to establish a backdoor or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information, communicating with external malicious servers, downloading and executing a suspicious file, and suppressing errors. It appears designed for unauthorized remote control or malware installation, indicating high security risk.",
