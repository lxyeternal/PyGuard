{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content; it appears to be an empty or placeholder script.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data sources identified within the code, possibly because the code is empty.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data could be leaked or executed, as no code is present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows because the code does not contain executable statements or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears empty; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains no actual code content to analyze. As a result, there are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious or malicious code structures detected. The absence of code prevents identification of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is effectively empty or missing. With no executable content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. The overall risk is negligible, and confidence in this assessment is high due to the lack of code.",
