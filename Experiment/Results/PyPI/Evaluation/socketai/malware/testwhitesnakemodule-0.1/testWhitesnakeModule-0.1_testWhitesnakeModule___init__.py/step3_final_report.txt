  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or privacy violations. The absence of obfuscation and suspicious patterns suggests benign behavior. The low complexity limits full assessment but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero.",
