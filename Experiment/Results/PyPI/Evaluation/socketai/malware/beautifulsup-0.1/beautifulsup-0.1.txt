      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It uses advanced obfuscation to conceal activities such as silent package installation, creation of shortcuts, privilege escalation, and file manipulations. The high level of obfuscation and system interaction indicates a strong malicious intent, warranting immediate quarantine or removal from any environment. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score is justified at 0.85."

      "conclusion": "The code snippets and reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. A conservative risk score of approximately 0.15 is recommended to account for minimal residual uncertainty. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on current analysis."
