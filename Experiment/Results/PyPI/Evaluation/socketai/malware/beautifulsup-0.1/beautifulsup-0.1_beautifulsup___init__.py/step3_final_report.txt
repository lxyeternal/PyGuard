  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Code input, data processing functions, environment variables, network calls, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system access, environment variable usage, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, environment reads, or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious functions like 'eval' or 'exec'.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or benign nature of code snippets. Reports with no code or empty scripts are accurately assessed, with low confidence scores justified by limited information. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Risk scores are low (around 0.2), reflecting minimal threat. Malware scores are consistently zero, indicating no malicious activity. The reasoning across reports is cautious, justified, and aligns with the evidence. No anomalies or red flags are present, and the overall assessment supports a benign conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. A conservative risk score of approximately 0.15 is recommended to account for minimal residual uncertainty. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on current analysis.",
