{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'tphttprand', likely intended for distribution via PyPI. It also contains obfuscated code that executes a command when a specific directory does not exist.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem (os.path.exists), environment via import statements, and potentially user environment during package setup.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess.Popen with a PowerShell encoded command when 'tahg' directory does not exist.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check (source) triggers the execution of the PowerShell command (sink) if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of obfuscated PowerShell encoded command that executes automatically based on a filesystem condition; no clear benign purpose for this action. The code also silently ignores exceptions during setup, which could hide issues.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core and attempts to import subprocess and os modules. It then checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg'. If the directory does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command encoded in base64, likely to perform malicious or suspicious actions. The setup function is called to define package metadata for 'tphttprand', but any exceptions during this process are silently ignored. The obfuscated PowerShell command is a significant concern, as such encoding is often used to hide malicious payloads. The use of try-except blocks with silent pass statements can conceal errors and malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered by a filesystem check, indicating potential malicious activity. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the suspicious code. The overall risk level is high due to the obfuscated execution that could execute malicious commands without user awareness.",
