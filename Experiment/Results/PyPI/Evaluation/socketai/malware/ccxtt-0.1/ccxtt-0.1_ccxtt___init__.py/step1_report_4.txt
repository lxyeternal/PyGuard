  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing a specific task, likely involving data processing or utility functions. No explicit malicious intent is evident based on the visible code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, standard input, or environment variables (if any are used). Specific sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file writing operations, network connections, or execution of system commands if present. No such operations are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like output files or network connections. No such flows are explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident in the visible code. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with clear structure. No signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration are observed. The lack of obfuscation, suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors suggests it is a benign utility. However, due to the absence of actual code content in the provided input, a definitive analysis cannot be performed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty or incomplete code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but more complete context would be necessary for a thorough review.",
