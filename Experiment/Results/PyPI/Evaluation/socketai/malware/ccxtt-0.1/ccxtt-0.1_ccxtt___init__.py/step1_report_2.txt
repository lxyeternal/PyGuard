{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general data processing or utility functions, but no specific purpose is clearly defined.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely read from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules. No explicit data sources are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or database interactions if present, but none are explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Without explicit data flow paths shown in the code, it is not possible to identify source-to-sink flows definitively.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are visible. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious imports, functions, or operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The lack of complex or opaque code suggests it's standard utility code. Absence of clear data sources and sinks prevents detailed flow analysis but also indicates no immediate risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
