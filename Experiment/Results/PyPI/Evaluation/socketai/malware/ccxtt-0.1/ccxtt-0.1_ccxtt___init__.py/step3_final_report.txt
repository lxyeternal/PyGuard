  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, structure, and potential signals of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file reads, network connections, system commands, and data inputs within the code.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, system commands, or data exfiltration points that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or files to sinks like network sockets or system commands, potentially via eval()/exec() or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, complex code structures, suspicious network URLs/IPs, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns like eval()/exec() usage without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits characteristics of obfuscation and complex structure, with potential network or system operations. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but suspicion arises from obfuscation and suspicious data handling. Benign code shows straightforward data processing without suspicious activity. Incomplete or absent code cannot be evaluated. Scores reflect these observations: a low malware score (0.2) for the suspicious code, justified obfuscation (0.4), and moderate security risk (0.4). Benign code receives zero or minimal scores with high confidence. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with slight room for adjustment if further malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code generally appears benign, with the exception of Report 1, which shows obfuscation and suspicious data handling but no confirmed malicious payloads. The current scores are appropriate and reflect a cautious stance. No significant changes are necessary; ongoing monitoring is recommended for suspicious code segments.",
