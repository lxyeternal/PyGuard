  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for general data processing or utility functions, but without explicit context or comments, its primary purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, function arguments, and possibly external modules or files if present, though no specific input sources are visible in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions such as print statements, file writes, network calls, or database operations, but no explicit sink functions are identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various processing steps to output sinks; however, due to the lack of concrete input/output operations in the visible code, flow analysis cannot be fully established.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are apparent. The code lacks comments or unusual patterns that might suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No dynamic execution or obfuscation markers are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python syntax. No suspicious modules, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are identified. It does not contain any evident malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms. The absence of context limits complete assessment, but based on the visible code, there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be benign and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malware. However, without additional context or full code, a definitive assessment cannot be guaranteed.",
