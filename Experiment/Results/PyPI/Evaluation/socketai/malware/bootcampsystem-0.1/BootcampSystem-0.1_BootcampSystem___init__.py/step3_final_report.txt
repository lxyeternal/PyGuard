  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval(), exec(), network modules, environment variables, file operations, hardcoded strings, dynamic attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Network calls, file writes, system commands, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval()/exec() and environment variables flow into network communication, system commands, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscation, dynamic code generation, network activity, lack of comments, suspicious strings, environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with network activity and environment variable usage indicating potential malicious intent. Reports 1, 3, and 4 highlight these behaviors, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 2 and 5 show benign features with no suspicious activity. The scores in the reports are generally consistent with the described behaviors. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 4 from 0.5 to 0.6 better reflects its obfuscation and dynamic execution. Overall, the combined assessment suggests a malware score around 0.75, obfuscation around 0.75, and security risk around 0.75, indicating a high but not maximum threat level.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows significant signs of obfuscation and malicious behavior, especially in reports 1, 3, and 4. The overall risk is high, warranting caution. Adjustments to report 4's malware score improve the accuracy of the assessment. The other reports are benign and correctly scored.",
