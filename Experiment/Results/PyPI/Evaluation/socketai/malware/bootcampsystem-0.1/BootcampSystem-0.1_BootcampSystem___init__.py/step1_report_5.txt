{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some standard functionality without any immediately obvious malicious intent. It may be part of a larger application, but the specific purpose is unclear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly configuration files. Specific input points are not explicitly visible due to the lack of code context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write/read operations, or subprocess calls. No direct sink is evident from the given snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations. Without concrete code, detailed flow mapping is limited.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. No obfuscated or misleading code features are present.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the provided code indicates that it uses standard Python structures and libraries. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation. The absence of suspicious network activity, obfuscated segments, or harmful functions supports this assessment. However, the lack of specific code limits the certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more comprehensive review with full context is recommended to confirm this.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
