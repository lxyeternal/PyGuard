      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, with silent error handling, indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation and execution behavior justify elevated malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The package should be considered compromised or malicious, and further analysis of the payload is recommended."
