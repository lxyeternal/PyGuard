  "anomalies": "Obfuscated expressions using complex bitwise and arithmetic operations to assign values to variables, multiple layers of convoluted map and getattr calls with nested expressions, extensive use of string manipulation via character code calculations, use of non-descriptive variable names with Chinese characters and unusual characters, complex control flow with deep nesting, conditional flow based on obscure calculations, use of dynamic imports and indirect function calls, potential dynamic code execution or file operations hidden behind obfuscated code blocks.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a highly obfuscated conditional based on sys.platform, involving complex character code and bitwise operations, likely designed to hide its true intent. It uses these calculations to control the flow of execution, including installing or modifying packages via pip, manipulating environment variables, creating directories, and performing file operations. Multiple complex nested loops and conditionals, some involving admin privilege checks via ctypes, suggest dynamic behavior that could modify system state or files. The extensive use of obfuscated expressions, string manipulations, and indirect function calls (like gettattr and map) indicate attempts to hide malicious intent or obscure the actual behavior. There are operations that seem to read, write, and delete files, and potential network or system modifications based on complex conditions. The code appears to be designed to execute different actions depending on obscure calculations, which could include malicious activities such as privilege escalation, file manipulations, or code execution, masked behind a layer of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains highly obfuscated code with complex control flow and dynamic system interactions. While it ostensibly performs setup tasks for a package, the heavy obfuscation, indirect system calls, environment variable manipulations, and conditional logic based on convoluted calculations raise suspicion of malicious intent. There are potential risks of system modifications, privilege escalation, and hidden malicious operations disguised as benign package setup. Overall, the code exhibits signs consistent with obfuscation designed to conceal malicious behavior and should be treated as potentially dangerous.",
