  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0.4,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate benign code with low suspicion, except Report 3 which shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no definitive malicious activity is confirmed. The overall threat level is minimal, with cautious suspicion in Report 3 justifying moderate scores."
