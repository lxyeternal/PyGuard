{
  "purpose": "The setup script for a Python package that includes a post-installation process which sends system information over the network.",
  "sources": "Requests data from 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org', reads the README.md file, and accesses system properties like os.uname() and __file__ path.",
  "sinks": "Requests GET requests with encoded data sent to external domains, writes to a local file 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "flows": "The code reads IP address and system info, encodes and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to external servers during installation. It also writes proof data to a local file.",
  "anomalies": "Performs network communication during package installation, sending potentially sensitive system info without user consent. Writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with arbitrary text. Uses hardcoded URL endpoints. The code is embedded within a setup script, which is unusual for benign packages.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various modules, including requests and os, and defines an installation class that registers a post-installation function. The _post_install function executes during install, writing a proof file locally, then gathers system info (IP, hostname, path), encodes it in base64, and transmits it to an external domain. The network activity occurs automatically upon package installation, which is suspicious. The purpose seems to be collecting and exfiltrating system info. The code does not perform malicious file operations or system modifications but does involve privacy-invasive network communication and local file writing during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior, notably exfiltration of system data during installation without user awareness. The network activity and writing of proof files suggest malicious intent related to privacy invasion or system reconnaissance. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered suspicious.",
