  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- All reports identify the presence of a `_post_install()` function that:\n  - Writes to a file named `'pocbykotko.txt'` with a static message.\n  - Collects system info: public IP (`https://api.ipify.org`), hostname (`os.uname()`), and current file path.\n  - Encodes this info in base64.\n  - Sends it via an HTTP GET request to `'https://kotko.org'` with parameters embedding the encoded data.\n- The `_post_install()` function is registered during setup to run after installation, which is atypical and suspicious.\n- The network requests and file writing occur during package installation, raising concerns about data exfiltration.\n- The external URL `'kotko.org'` is suspicious, and the behavior resembles covert data collection.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** Yes. The code exfiltrates system info during install.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code; the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware suspicion:** High. The behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration.\n- **Security risk:** High, given the unauthorized collection and transmission of system data.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Errors:\n- No logical errors are evident; the code functions as described.\n- The main concern is the malicious intent, not a coding flaw.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.9, which is reasonable given the behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.85 to 0.9, reflecting high severity.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n### Justification for high scores:\n- The code performs network communication during package install without user consent.\n- Sends sensitive system info to an external domain.\n- Writes a file with a static message, possibly as proof or marker.\n- These actions are characteristic of malicious activity, justifying a risk score above 0.5.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify the malicious pattern.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the observed network activity and file operations.\n- The external URL and data encoding reinforce malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0.9** — justified by covert data exfiltration during install.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** **0.9** — high due to unauthorized data collection, transmission, and potential privacy invasion.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- The package should be flagged or removed from distribution channels.\n- Users should be warned against installing this package.\n- Developers should review and audit any similar setup scripts for malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion,** the overall malicious behavior is clear, with high confidence. The scores are appropriate and justified. The code exhibits signs of supply chain malware designed to stealthily gather and transmit user system data during installation.",
