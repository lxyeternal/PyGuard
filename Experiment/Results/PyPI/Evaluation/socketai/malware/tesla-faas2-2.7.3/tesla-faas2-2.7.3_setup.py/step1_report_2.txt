{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, with some custom post-install behavior that involves network requests and file operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; makes HTTP GET requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org'; reads the script's file path; uses environment info via os.uname(); processes strings for base64 encoding.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs ('https://kotko.org') with encoded data; writing to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt'); reading system info; making network requests with potentially sensitive info (IP, hostname, path).",
  "flows": "System info (IP, hostname, path) is gathered, encoded, and sent via GET request to 'https://kotko.org?...' URL. File 'pocbykotko.txt' is appended with a proof string during install.",
  "anomalies": "The _post_install() function executes network requests and writes data during package installation, which is unusual and could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. Use of requests to external domains and encoding data before sending is suspicious. The code is embedded directly in setup.py, which is atypical.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install class that registers a post-install hook (_post_install) which is invoked during installation. This function writes a file ('pocbykotko.txt') with a proof string and sends system information (public IP, hostname, install path) encoded in base64 to an external domain ('kotko.org') via a GET request. No user input is involved, but the code performs network operations that can exfiltrate system info. The network activity during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the hardcoded external URL and encoding method. The rest of the code primarily configures package metadata, with no other malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious or at least suspicious behavior pattern by executing network requests and writing files during package installation. It appears designed to gather and exfiltrate system information without user consent. The rest of the setup code is benign and standard. Overall, the script exhibits likely malicious intent with high security risk.",
