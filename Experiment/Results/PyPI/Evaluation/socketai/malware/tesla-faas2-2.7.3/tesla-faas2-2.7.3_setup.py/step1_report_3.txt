{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, mainly configuring package metadata and install behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests to external domains ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org') during post-installation, reading README.md file, environment variables, and system info.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs with base64-encoded data, file writing ('pocbykotko.txt'), and potential data leakage via network communication.",
  "flows": "During post-install, the code retrieves the public IP, system hostname, and path; encodes this data; then sends it to a suspicious domain. File 'pocbykotko.txt' is also created and appended with text.",
  "anomalies": "The '_post_install' function is registered to run after installation, and it performs network requests and file operations that are not typical for a setup script. The data sent includes system info encoded in base64 and sent over HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain ('kotko.org'). The URL includes potentially sensitive information. The use of 'atexit' and external requests in a setup context is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions as a setup configuration for a Python package, but it contains malicious or suspicious behavior in the '_post_install' function. It gathers system information (IP, hostname, path), encodes this information, and exfiltrates it to an external server ('kotko.org') during or immediately after installation. This behavior resembles data theft or malware activity, as it leaks system information without user consent. The creation of a file ('pocbykotko.txt') and writing to it with a hardcoded message is also suspicious, indicating potential backdoor or proof of compromise. The external requests and data exfiltration are not standard for a setup script and suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear signs of malicious behavior, primarily data exfiltration of system info during package installation. The post-installation steps are suspicious and indicate potential malware or supply chain attack activity. The code should be considered unsafe due to its unauthorized data collection and transmission behavior.",
