{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project, with some custom post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs ('https://api.ipify.org' and 'https://kotko.org') during post-install; reading 'README.md'; accessing system information via os.uname() and pathlib; file writing to 'pocbykotko.txt'.",
  "sinks": "Network requests send potentially sensitive information (IP address, hostname, file path) to external servers; writing to local file 'pocbykotko.txt' with static content.",
  "flows": "Post-install function collects system info and IP, encodes it, and sends it to an external server. Also, it writes a static message to a file. The setup process calls the post-install function via a custom install class.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install function retrieves system IP, hostname, and file path, encodes and transmits this data to a suspicious domain ('kotko.org'). It writes a proof message to a local file. The code is integrated into the setup process, which is uncommon for benign packages.",
  "analysis": "The setup script performs standard packaging tasks, but includes a malicious-looking '_post_install' function that exfiltrates system information to an external server upon installation. It writes a static proof message to a local file named 'pocbykotko.txt'. The external request to 'kotko.org' encodes system data in base64 and sends it as part of a GET request, which could be used for malicious tracking or data theft. The code uses 'requests' for network communication and system info collection, which are common but can be misused here. The code is embedded into the custom 'install' command class, triggering during package installation, which is suspicious behavior for a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a setup script that, upon installation, exfiltrates system information to an external server and writes a static message to a file. These behaviors are malicious, indicating an intent to spy on or gather data from the user's system without disclosure. The overall risk score is high due to data exfiltration and hidden malicious behavior.",
