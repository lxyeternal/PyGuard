{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform covert data exfiltration during package installation by collecting system info and sending it to an external server, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for IP, 'https://kotko.org' for data exfiltration, reading '__file__' path, and 'os.uname()[1]' for hostname.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external domains, writing to 'pocbykotko.txt', encoding data in base64 and sending via HTTP GET, and reading system info.",
  "flows": "Source data (IP, hostname, path) is collected, encoded in base64, then transmitted via network request; system info is also written to a file during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Network activity and file writing occur during package installation, which is unusual; data is encoded but sent to suspicious external domains; no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code executes during setup, performing network requests to exfiltrate system info and writing a proof file, all embedded in a custom install class. The behavior is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but highly suspicious and characteristic of malware. The external URL and data collection during install strongly suggest malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, risk ~0.9, obfuscation 0) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains clear malicious behavior involving covert data exfiltration during installation. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The code's actions warrant immediate concern, flagging it as a supply chain attack or malware.",
