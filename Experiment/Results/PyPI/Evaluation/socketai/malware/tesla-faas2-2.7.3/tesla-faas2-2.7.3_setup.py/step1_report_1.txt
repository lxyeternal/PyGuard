{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that configures package metadata, dependencies, and custom installation behavior, including executing post-install actions.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, fetching the external IP address via requests.get, accessing environment and system data such as os.uname() and __file__, and performing an HTTP GET request with encoded data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external domains ('https://kotko.org') with encoded data, file operations writing to 'pocbykotko.txt', and potentially unsafe data handling via base64 encoding.",
  "flows": "Source: obtaining IP address, system hostname, and current path -> encoding this data into base64 -> sending data via HTTP GET request to 'https://kotko.org' with embedded encoded message.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network communication with an external domain, encodes system information into base64, writes to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a suspicious message, and executes these actions during post-installation, which is unusual for a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with typical package metadata and dependencies. However, it includes a hidden post-install function that writes to a file and sends system data (IP, hostname, path) to a suspicious external URL, which is not typical behavior for a benign package. The use of base64 encoding and HTTP GET requests with embedded system info could be used to exfiltrate data, indicating malicious intent. The code also registers this post-install function to run during installation, further raising suspicion. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present beyond these network and file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, including system data exfiltration and file manipulation, during package installation. These actions are embedded as a post-install hook, which is suspicious and indicative of potential malware or malicious intent. The package exhibits signs of sabotage, aiming to gather and transmit system information covertly.",
