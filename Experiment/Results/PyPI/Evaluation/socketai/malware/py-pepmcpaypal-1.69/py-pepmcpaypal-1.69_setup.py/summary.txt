  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell payload executed conditionally, indicating malicious intent. The package setup appears legitimate but is overshadowed by embedded malicious activity. The high obfuscation, stealthy execution, and suspicious URL justify high malware and risk scores. All reports correctly identify these indicators, and their scoring is consistent with the observed behavior."
