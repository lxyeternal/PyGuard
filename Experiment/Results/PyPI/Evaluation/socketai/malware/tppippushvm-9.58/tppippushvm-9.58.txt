      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, indicating likely malicious activity. The obfuscation, silent execution, and conditional trigger suggest an attempt to conceal malicious payloads. The security risk and malware scores should be high, reflecting this threat level."
