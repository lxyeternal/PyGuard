  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and performs system-level modifications, package installations, and shortcut creation, all of which are suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The high scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the observed behavior. It should be flagged for further analysis, sandbox testing, and considered high risk or malicious until verified."
