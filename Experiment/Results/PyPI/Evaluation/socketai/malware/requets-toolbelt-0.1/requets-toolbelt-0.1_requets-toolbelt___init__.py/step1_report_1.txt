  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content. It may be intended for a Python package or script functionality.",
  "sources": "The code would potentially read data from user input, environment variables, or external files, but no specific source points are visible due to lack of code provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks would include network connections, file writing, or system commands if present, but none are evident from the empty code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths can be identified without code content; typical source-to-sink paths are absent.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is entirely empty; there are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detectable.",
  "analysis": "Given that no code has been provided, there is no logic, data handling, or behavior to analyze. This results in no identifiable security issues or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be empty or non-existent, leading to a conclusion of no risk.",
