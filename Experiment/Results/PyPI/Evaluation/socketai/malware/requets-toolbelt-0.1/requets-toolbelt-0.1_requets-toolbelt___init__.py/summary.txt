  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with their content. The moderate suspicion in report 4 is justified by eval and obfuscation signs. No evidence of confirmed malicious activity is present, but signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution warrant cautious scoring. The overall security posture remains low to moderate, with no critical issues identified."
