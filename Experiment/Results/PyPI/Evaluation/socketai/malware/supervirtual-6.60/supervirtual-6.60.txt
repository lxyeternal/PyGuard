      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution during setup, which could facilitate malicious payloads or sabotage. The silent exception handling further conceals errors, increasing risk. The assigned scores are appropriate; the package should be treated as highly suspicious pending further decoding and analysis of the payload."
