      "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior via obfuscated PowerShell execution during setup, with indicators such as URL, obfuscation, and stealthy execution. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: ~0.9, obfuscated: ~0.9, security risk: ~0.9) are justified and consistent with the evidence. The package should be considered highly malicious and avoided."
