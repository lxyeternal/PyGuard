  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, malicious PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, with a suspicious URL indicating malicious infrastructure. Silent error handling and background execution increase stealth. The setup script appears legitimate but is exploited as a cover for malicious activity. The high malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are justified and should be treated as a serious security concern."
