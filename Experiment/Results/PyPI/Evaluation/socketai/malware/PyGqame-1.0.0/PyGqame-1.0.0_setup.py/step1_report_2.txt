{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'PyGqame' with specified metadata and custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads package setup parameters, environment info (os.name), and attempts to import 'requests' and 'fernet'. It also contains embedded encrypted data used for decryption.",
  "sinks": "The code executes decrypted code via exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code, potentially malicious. It also imports and uses 'requests' and 'fernet', which could be used for network communication or cryptography maliciously.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking the OS, importing modules, decrypting data, and executing the decrypted code. The decrypted code runs in the same process and could perform harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes obfuscated variable names, encrypted data, and an exec() call on decrypted content, which is suspicious. The use of Fernet encryption with a hardcoded key and dynamic execution of decrypted data indicates potential malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with typical metadata. However, it defines a custom install class that, upon installation, checks if the OS is Windows. If so, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts embedded encrypted data with a hardcoded key and executes the resulting code. This pattern is common in malicious code trying to conceal its true purpose. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution is suspicious and indicates possible malicious behavior, such as installing backdoors, keyloggers, or other malware during package installation. The code's obfuscation through variable naming and encrypted code further supports malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be malicious or at least suspicious due to its obfuscated encrypted payload, dynamic execution, and the inclusion of potentially harmful behavior triggered during installation. It uses obfuscation and runtime code execution to hide its true purpose, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
