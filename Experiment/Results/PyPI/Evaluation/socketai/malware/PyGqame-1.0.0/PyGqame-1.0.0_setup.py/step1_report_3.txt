{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'PyGqame' and includes a custom install command that decrypts and executes encrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and reads environment information ('os.name') during execution. The encrypted data for Fernet decryption is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via 'exec' on the output of Fernet decryption. The 'exec' function is a potential sink that can execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking if the OS is Windows, then importing 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypting embedded encrypted code, and executing it via 'exec'.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded encryption key and encrypted payload used in 'exec' introduces significant risk. The decrypted code's content is not visible, making behavior potentially malicious and obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom installation class that, on Windows, decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload, then executes the decrypted code. The use of 'exec' with dynamically decrypted code indicates obfuscated behavior, potentially malicious. The code does not perform any visible benign actions besides setting up a package but includes concealed code execution, which is a common tactic for malicious activity or backdoors. The decryption key and encrypted payload are hardcoded, suggesting malicious intent or covert behavior. The presence of encrypted code and the conditional execution only on Windows strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious actions during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious behavior, notably decrypting and executing hidden code during installation on Windows. The hardcoded encryption key and 'exec' usage are suspicious. Overall, this package exhibits high malicious potential and should be regarded as dangerous.",
