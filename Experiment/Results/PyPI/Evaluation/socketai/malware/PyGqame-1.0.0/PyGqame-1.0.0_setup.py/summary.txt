  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior indicative of malicious intent, primarily due to decrypting and executing an encrypted payload during installation on Windows. The obfuscation tactics and runtime code execution strongly suggest malicious activity, warranting a high malware and security risk score. The package should be flagged for further analysis or rejection unless the decrypted payload is verified safe."
