{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be intended for general data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose cannot be determined definitively without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, network connections, or external systems; uses of eval or exec could be potential sinks if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) through processing functions and potentially to sinks (output, network, or file operations).",
  "anomalies": "No overt anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. Look for unusual patterns like dynamic execution, or obscure variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard imports and function definitions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious imports are evident. If dynamic execution functions (like eval, exec) are used without sanitization, they could pose risks, but none are apparent here. The code does not connect to external servers or handle sensitive data explicitly. No hardcoded secrets are visible. The structure suggests typical utility code, with no malicious payloads or backdoors observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears benign with standard functionality. However, without seeing the complete code, particularly runtime behaviors or external interactions, confidence remains moderate.",
