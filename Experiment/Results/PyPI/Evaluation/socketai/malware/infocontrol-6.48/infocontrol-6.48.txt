      "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious obfuscated PowerShell execution conditioned on filesystem state, with broad error suppression. While the package setup appears benign, the encoded command's purpose warrants further analysis. The high obfuscation and silent, conditional execution suggest malicious intent, justifying high malware and security risk scores. Decoding the PowerShell payload is essential for definitive assessment."
