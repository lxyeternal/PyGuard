      "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior, executing an obfuscated PowerShell payload during package setup. The suspicious comments, obfuscation, and stealth execution strongly suggest a supply chain attack or backdoor. The package should be considered compromised, and further decoding of the PowerShell command is recommended to confirm malicious payloads."
