      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell payload in a hidden window, triggered conditionally, with embedded suspicious URL. The silent error handling further conceals potential malicious failures. The package should be considered malicious or compromised until further payload decoding confirms benign intent."
