{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'tensofla' that installs dependencies and executes obfuscated code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, executes decrypted code using Fernet, and imports packages such as requests and fernet.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code with 'exec', which could run malicious payloads if the decryption key or payload is malicious.",
  "flows": "The source is the Fernet decryption of an encrypted string, which flows into 'exec', executing potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The use of an obfuscated encrypted payload decrypted at install time and executed via 'exec' is suspicious. The long, random-looking description strings, and the oddly named class, indicate obfuscation. The package installs 'fernet' and 'requests' but also runs code that could be malicious, which is uncommon for legitimate setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, when run, checks if the OS is Windows, then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and payload, and executes this payload dynamically via 'exec'. This behavior is unusual for a standard setup script and suggests malicious intent, especially given the obfuscated nature of the code, the encrypted payload, and execution at install time. The use of encrypted code and 'exec' poses high security risks, as malicious code can be hidden and triggered during installation. The rest of the code appears to be standard package setup with no other suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably the decryption and execution of encrypted code during package installation, which is highly suspicious. The obfuscation and dynamic execution indicate potential malware or backdoor activity. This package should be treated with extreme caution and not used.",
