  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package with a custom installation command that executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the os.name; importing modules; reading hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload; executing decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function with decrypted code; potentially executing malicious code retrieved from the encrypted payload.",
  "flows": "os.name check -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypt encrypted payload -> execute resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload that decrypts and executes code during installation. The decrypted code is not visible but is executed dynamically, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, on Windows systems, imports requests and Fernet modules, then decrypts an embedded encrypted payload using a hardcoded key, and executes the decrypted code via exec(). The payload is encrypted, which obscures its contents, and the execution of dynamic code during installation is a common tactic for malicious activity or backdoors. The use of a hardcoded key and encrypted code indicates intent to hide malicious payload. Other parts of the code involve standard setup procedures, but the core suspicious behavior is in the run() method of the custom install class. No other suspicious dependencies or code structures are identified. Overall, this pattern suggests malicious intent, possibly a backdoor or malware executing arbitrary code upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior where encrypted payload is decrypted and executed during installation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The use of encrypted code and dynamic execution without clear transparency is suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
