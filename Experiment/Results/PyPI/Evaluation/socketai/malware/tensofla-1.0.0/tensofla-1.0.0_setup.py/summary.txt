  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious behavior, decrypting and executing an encrypted payload during installation on Windows, with heavy obfuscation. The pattern is consistent with malware or backdoor activity, warranting maximum malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. The reports correctly identify these issues, and the overall assessment is that this package is malicious and should be avoided."
