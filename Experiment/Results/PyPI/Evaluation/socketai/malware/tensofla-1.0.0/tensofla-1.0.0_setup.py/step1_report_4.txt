{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with custom installation behavior that includes executing decrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from hardcoded encrypted strings, imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and executes decrypted code using exec().",
  "sinks": "exec() executes decrypted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the decrypted content is malicious.",
  "flows": "Encrypted string decrypts via Fernet, then passed to exec() to run potentially malicious code during install on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted string and immediate execution via exec() without validation; unusually complex class and variable names; the decrypted payload is not visible in code, obscuring intent.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom install class. During installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, executing the resulting code via exec(). The encrypted payload could contain malicious instructions, which are executed automatically during installation, representing a significant security risk. The code appears intentionally obfuscated, likely to conceal malicious behavior, especially given the use of encrypted payloads and execution during setup. No external input is involved; all data is hardcoded, but the decrypted code's behavior is hidden and potentially harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows, which can lead to arbitrary remote or local code execution. The obfuscation and execution of encrypted payloads indicate high malicious intent. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
