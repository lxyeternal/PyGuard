{
  "purpose": "The script defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation command that executes decrypted code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'os' module, a hardcoded Fernet key, and a hardcoded encrypted payload within the custom 'run' method of the installation class.",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious code execution via 'exec' on decrypted data; network request modules ('requests') imported but not directly used here; decryption output executed directly, which could be malicious.",
  "flows": "On Windows systems, the installation process imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts a payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via 'exec'. Data flows from hardcoded encrypted string to decryption, then directly to execution, constituting a malicious code flow.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a heavily obfuscated class name, nonsensical description and long description strings, and an 'exec' of decrypted data during install suggest obfuscation. The code decrypts and executes code without validation. The 'install' class name and method are intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script for a Python package. It defines package metadata and a custom 'install' command that, on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'fernet', decrypts an embedded payload with a hardcoded key, and executes it via 'exec'. The use of encrypted payloads combined with execution during installation indicates malicious intent, potentially executing arbitrary code on the target system. The obfuscated class name and the manner of code execution are suspicious and typical of malware delivery methods. The code attempts to conceal its true behavior by obfuscation and encrypted payloads. The 'setup_requires' includes 'fernet' and 'requests' but does not necessarily imply benign intent; in context, these modules are used to decrypt and execute malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior; it decrypts and executes arbitrary code during package installation on Windows systems. The obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution pattern strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to run arbitrary malicious code. The package appears to be designed for supply chain attack or malware distribution.",
