      "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious intent, primarily through the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command during package setup. The tactics used—silent execution, obfuscation, error suppression—are consistent with malicious payloads aiming to evade detection. While decoding the command would clarify its exact purpose, the current evidence warrants high suspicion. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend treating this package as malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise."
