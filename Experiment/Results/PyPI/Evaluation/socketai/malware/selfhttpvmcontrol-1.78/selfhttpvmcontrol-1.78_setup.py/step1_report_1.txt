{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to set up a Python package named 'selfhttpvmcontrol' and includes a hidden process execution that may be malicious.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.Popen call with encoded PowerShell command, reading from the filesystem with os.path.exists",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess with shell=False and creationflags, potentially executing malicious PowerShell commands",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory; if absent, executes a hidden PowerShell command; then proceeds with package setup",
  "anomalies": "Encoded PowerShell command executed via subprocess without validation, presence of suspicious URL (esquelesquad.rip), no clear purpose for the command, and silent exception handling",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing distutils for setup. It then attempts to import subprocess and os, and if the directory 'tahg' does not exist, it executes a PowerShell command encoded in base64, which is hidden and not directly readable. The PowerShell command points to a suspicious domain (esquelesquad.rip). The command runs silently without any logging or validation, indicating potential malicious activity. The setup function defines a package named 'selfhttpvmcontrol' with associated metadata, but the critical concern is the encoded command which may execute malicious code or establish hidden backdoors. Exception handling is broad and silent, masking errors. Overall, the script contains suspicious activity in the hidden PowerShell execution, indicating a potential supply chain attack or backdoor, while the package setup itself appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious hidden PowerShell command that contacts a suspicious domain and runs silently, which indicates malicious intent. The package setup appears normal but is likely used as a vector for executing malicious payloads. High confidence in malicious behavior, with potential backdoor or remote control intent.",
