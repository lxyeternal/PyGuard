  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-confidence malicious pattern: executing an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell payload during package setup conditioned on filesystem state. The activity is stealthy, obfuscated, and linked to suspicious URL, indicating a likely malicious intent. Scores should be set at malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, and security risk 0.9 to reflect the high severity and confidence."
