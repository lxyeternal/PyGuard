  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code, then evaluate the scores and underlying assumptions.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The original code snippet:\n```python\n#Tahg4ever\n\ndef suma(n1: int, n1:int) -> int:\n    return n1 + n2\n\ndef resta(n1: int, n1:int) -> int:\n    return n1 - n2\n```\n- **Issues identified:**\n  - Parameter naming errors: duplicate parameter names (`n1` used twice in each function), which is invalid in Python and would cause syntax errors.\n  - Use of `n2` in the return statements without defining or passing `n2`, leading to NameError if executed.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code contains syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names and undefined variables. These are *not* malicious issues but rather coding mistakes or incomplete code.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Review each report's reasoning and scores**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names. No malicious behavior or malware detected.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (very low, just acknowledging poor code quality)\n  - confidence: 0.4\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The confidence is moderate, reflecting the code issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, notes parameter naming issues and syntax errors. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 0.9 (high confidence in the analysis)\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No malware, and the high confidence reflects clarity that the code is flawed but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Same issues with parameter naming errors and syntax errors, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1\n  - confidence: 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious behavior, just syntax issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Identifies syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names and undefined variables. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware, just code errors.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Similar issues with parameter naming and undefined variables. No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the malware scores**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code analysis: the code is simple arithmetic with syntax errors, no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the obfuscated scores**\n\n- All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's straightforward nature and lack of obfuscation.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the security risk scores**\n\n- Most are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting that these are just syntax errors in arithmetic functions, not security issues.\n\n**Step 6: Justify higher risk scores if any**\n\n- Since the code is just faulty arithmetic functions with syntax errors, no reason exists to assign higher risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Final assessment and recommendations**\n\n- The code is clearly flawed but not malicious.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The main issues are syntax errors and poor coding practices, not security or malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to syntax errors and poor code quality, but not security-related)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code contains syntax errors and is not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is code quality, not security.\n\n**Final note:** The code should be corrected for syntax errors—parameter naming should be consistent and variables properly defined—to ensure functionality.",
