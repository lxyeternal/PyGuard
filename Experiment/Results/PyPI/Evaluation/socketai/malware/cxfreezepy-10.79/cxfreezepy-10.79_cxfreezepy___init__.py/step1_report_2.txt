{
  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction",
  "sources": "Function parameters n1 and n2 (though n2 is not explicitly defined in the code, indicating a likely typo or omission)",
  "sinks": "No identifiable sinks; functions perform basic arithmetic and return results",
  "flows": "Input parameters (intended as n1, n2) flow directly into return statements without further processing",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors in function parameters (redefining n1 twice, missing n2 parameter), no meaningful variable initialization, no external data handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions, 'suma' and 'resta', intended for addition and subtraction respectively. Both functions have parameter naming issues: they define 'n1' twice instead of 'n1' and 'n2', which would cause a syntax error or logical error during execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code; the code is straightforward arithmetic. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears incomplete or erroneous due to the parameter naming mistake.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains basic arithmetic functions with syntax errors in parameter definitions. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The primary issue is the parameter naming mistake, which would prevent proper execution.",
