{
  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) functions",
  "sources": "Function parameters n1 and n2 (although misnamed in the code), potential external calls if used elsewhere",
  "sinks": "Return statements (not directly sinks but could be used insecurely if misused elsewhere), no explicit sinks present",
  "flows": "Input parameters to return statements (simple operations), no complex data flow or external data used",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors: both functions define parameters as 'n1' instead of 'n1' and 'n2', which causes a syntax error and indicates poorly written code; no malicious anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains two functions intended for arithmetic operations. Both functions have parameter naming errors, redefining 'n1' twice, which would result in a syntax error upon execution. This suggests code is either incomplete, poorly written, or intentionally obfuscated. No data leaks, malicious behavior, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious behavior or malware indicators. The improper parameter naming reduces confidence that the code functions as intended.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be simple arithmetic functions with syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names. No malicious behavior or malware indications are present. The main concern is the coding mistake, which indicates poor quality or incomplete code, but nothing malicious.",
