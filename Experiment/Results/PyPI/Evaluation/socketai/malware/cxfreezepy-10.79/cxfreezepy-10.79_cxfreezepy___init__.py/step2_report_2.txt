  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Identified:** Syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names ('n1' defined twice). No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, mainly due to poor code quality). Confidence=0.4.\n- **Assessment:** The code's main problem is syntactical, not malicious. The low confidence and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Identified:** Similar parameter naming errors ('n1' and 'n2' issues). No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 (no security risk). Confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence aligns with the code errors, which are clear and straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Identified:** Same parameter naming errors, syntax errors prevent execution. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is faulty but not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Identified:** Syntax errors due to parameter naming ('n1' repeated, 'n2' missing). No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; syntax issues are the main concern, not security.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Identified:** Same parameter naming errors, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify syntax errors due to parameter naming issues.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation in any report.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting code errors rather than security threats.\n- Confidence levels are reasonable given the clear syntax issues.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain very low (around 0.1) for all, primarily due to poor coding quality, not security risk.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' assessments)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is flawed but not malicious. The main concern is code quality, which could lead to runtime errors, but it does not pose a security threat.",
