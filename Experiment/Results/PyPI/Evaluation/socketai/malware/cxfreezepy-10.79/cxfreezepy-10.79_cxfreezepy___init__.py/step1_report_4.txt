  "purpose": "Basic arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction",
  "sources": "Input parameters n1 and n2 (though 'n2' is not properly defined in the code)",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data output or external data interactions",
  "flows": "Inputs (n1, n2) flow into functions and produce arithmetic results",
  "anomalies": "Multiple issues: parameter naming inconsistencies, redefinition of 'n1' in function signatures, missing 'n2' parameter in 'suma' function, no actual malicious code or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions intended for arithmetic operations but contains syntax errors: both functions define parameters with the same name ('n1'), which is invalid. The 'suma' function references 'n2', which is not defined or passed as a parameter, leading to a NameError if executed. These are likely coding mistakes rather than malicious actions. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malware, or malicious data flow. The code appears incomplete and contains syntax issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior but is poorly written with syntax errors that prevent proper execution. It is not malicious but should be corrected for functionality. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
