  "purpose": "Arithmetic functions intended to perform addition and subtraction operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters `n1` (and intended `n2`), which are inputs to the functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements using `n1` and `n2`, which could potentially process untrusted data if inputs are externally supplied.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (`n1`, `n2`) flow into the functions and are used directly in calculations, returning the result.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate parameter names (`n1` used twice), referencing `n2` without defining or passing it, leading to syntax errors and undefined variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code contains syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names and references to undefined variables (`n2`). These issues prevent execution and indicate poorly written or incomplete code. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is evident. The code's primary flaw is syntactic, not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is flawed with syntax errors but shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is code correctness. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0. The overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting poor code quality rather than security threats.",
