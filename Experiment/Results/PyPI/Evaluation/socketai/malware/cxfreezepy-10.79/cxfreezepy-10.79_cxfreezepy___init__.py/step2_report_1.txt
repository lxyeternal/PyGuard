  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n```python\n#Tahg4ever\n\ndef suma(n1: int, n1:int) -> int:\n    return n1 + n2\n\ndef resta(n1: int, n1:int) -> int:\n    return n1 - n2\n```\nIssues:\n- Both functions have duplicate parameter names (`n1`), which is invalid in Python and would cause syntax errors.\n- The functions reference `n2`, which is not defined or passed as a parameter, leading to NameError if executed.\n- The code appears to be poorly written or intentionally obfuscated, but there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Highlights syntax errors due to duplicate parameter names.\n- Correctly notes no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.4 (moderate, given the code's errors)\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (probably because the code could cause runtime errors)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is flawed but not malicious. The low confidence is appropriate given the syntax errors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, notes parameter naming issues and syntax errors.\n- Confidence: 0.9 (high, due to the clear syntax errors)\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The high confidence is justified; these are fundamental syntax issues, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, notes parameter naming errors and syntax issues.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The report correctly identifies the syntax errors and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Mentions syntax errors, undefined variables, and parameter issues.\n- Confidence: 0.7\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The main problem is code correctness, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar issues: duplicate parameter names, undefined variables.\n- Confidence: 0.7\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. No malicious behavior is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency and Scores\n\n- All reports agree that the code contains syntax errors due to parameter naming issues.\n- None suggest malicious behavior or malware.\n- The confidence scores are reasonable, given the code's errors and lack of malicious indicators.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations\n\n- The code is **not malicious**; it's simply poorly written or incomplete.\n- The **security risk** is minimal; the main concern is that the code won't run as intended.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains zero; there's no obfuscation detected.\n- The **malware score** should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to syntax errors that could cause runtime issues but not security vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code's issues are syntactic and logical but do not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable and should not be adjusted upward.",
