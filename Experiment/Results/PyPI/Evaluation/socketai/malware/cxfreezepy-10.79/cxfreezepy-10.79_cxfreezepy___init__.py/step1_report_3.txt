  "purpose": "Simple arithmetic functions for addition and subtraction",
  "sources": "Function parameters n1 and n2 (though both parameters are incorrectly named in the code)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters (n1, n2) flow directly into return statements without modification",
  "anomalies": "Parameter naming is inconsistent (n1 used twice, no n2 parameter). Function definitions are syntactically incorrect due to repeated parameter names. No malicious code or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions intended for addition and subtraction. However, both functions have syntax errors: the parameters are named identically ('n1' twice), which is invalid in Python and would cause a syntax error during execution. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be incomplete or incorrectly written but lacks malicious or suspicious code features. No sources or sinks related to untrusted data or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains syntax errors that prevent execution. It appears to be intended as simple arithmetic functions with no malicious behavior or security issues. The main concern is the parameter naming mistake, which would need correction for proper functioning.",
