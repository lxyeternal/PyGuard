{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define basic arithmetic functions (sum and subtraction) with inconsistent parameter naming.",
  "sources": "Function parameters n1 and n1 (which should be n1 and n2), but only n1 is used, indicating a possible typo or mistake.",
  "sinks": "No external input sources or data outputs are present; functions are purely computational.",
  "flows": "Parameters are passed to functions and used directly in return statements; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical errors: duplicate parameter names 'n1' in functions, and variable 'n2' is used but not defined or passed. Comment '#Tahg4ever' is non-informative and irrelevant.",
  "analysis": "The code contains fundamental syntax errors: duplicate parameter names in function definitions ('n1' repeated) and use of an undefined variable 'n2' within functions. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious behaviors. The code seems to be a simple, incomplete or incorrectly written example of arithmetic functions, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is syntax errors due to parameter naming, which prevent proper execution but do not imply malicious activity.",
