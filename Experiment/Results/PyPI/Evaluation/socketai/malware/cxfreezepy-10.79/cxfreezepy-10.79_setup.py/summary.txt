  "conclusion": "The heavily obfuscated exec() combined with dynamic code execution suggests malicious intent. The package likely contains hidden payloads or sabotage code. It should be considered malicious or compromised. The obfuscation and use of exec() make it highly dangerous, and it is recommended to avoid deploying or distributing this package until a thorough deobfuscation and review are performed."
