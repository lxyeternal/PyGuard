{
  "purpose": "The code executes a heavily obfuscated exec() that decodes numerous strings into code, likely to conceal malicious payloads. It then calls setup() to package the module.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated strings constructed via float conversions, string splits, and chr() functions within the exec() call.",
  "sinks": "The exec() executes the decoded code, which could be malicious or sabotage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from obfuscated encoded strings, through decoding logic, into exec(), then to the setup() call if no exception occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, complex float and string manipulations, silent exception handling around setup(), and use of exec() on decoded data.",
  "analysis": "The code's obfuscation pattern—complex float calculations, string splits, chr() assembly, and execution via exec()—is characteristic of malicious payload concealment. The setup() call is standard but is only executed if no exception occurs, which is suspicious given the prior obfuscation. The silent try-except suppresses errors, hiding potential malicious failures or modifications. The overall pattern strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious code, likely a backdoor or sabotage payload.",
  "conclusion": "The heavily obfuscated exec() combined with dynamic code execution suggests malicious intent. The package likely contains hidden payloads or sabotage code. It should be considered malicious or compromised. The obfuscation and use of exec() make it highly dangerous, and it is recommended to avoid deploying or distributing this package until a thorough deobfuscation and review are performed.",
