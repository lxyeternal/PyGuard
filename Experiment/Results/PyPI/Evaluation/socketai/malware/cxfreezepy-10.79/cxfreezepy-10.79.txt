      "conclusion": "The heavily obfuscated exec() combined with dynamic code execution suggests malicious intent. The package likely contains hidden payloads or sabotage code. It should be considered malicious or compromised. The obfuscation and use of exec() make it highly dangerous, and it is recommended to avoid deploying or distributing this package until a thorough deobfuscation and review are performed."

      "conclusion": "The code is flawed with syntax errors but shows no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main concern is code correctness. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0. The overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting poor code quality rather than security threats."
