{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'edurl' Python package, including a hidden subprocess execution potentially for malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The subprocess call with encoded PowerShell command, checking for the existence of 'tahg' directory.",
  "sinks": "Execution of a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with hidden window, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The script checks for 'tahg' directory, then executes a hidden PowerShell command if not found.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encoded PowerShell command in subprocess, which is suspicious. The code executes potentially obfuscated commands without clear purpose. Broad exception handling suppresses errors, hiding potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'distutils.core.setup' for package installation, then attempts to run a subprocess with a PowerShell command encoded in base64. The command is executed in a hidden window, which is unusual and often indicative of malicious intent. The directory 'tahg' is checked before executing the command. The setup function appears standard, with no apparent malicious payload, but the obfuscated PowerShell command is suspicious and potentially malicious. Exception handling is broad, which can hide errors related to the subprocess call. Overall, the code attempts to hide malicious behavior via obfuscation and suppression of errors.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains suspicious behavior primarily due to the encoded PowerShell command executed in hidden mode. Although the setup process appears legitimate, the obfuscated command and hidden execution indicate potential malicious intent. The code should be reviewed further to decode the PowerShell payload and verify its purpose.",
