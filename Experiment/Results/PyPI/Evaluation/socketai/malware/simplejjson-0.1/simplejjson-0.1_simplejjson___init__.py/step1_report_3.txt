  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing, potentially involving network or file operations, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or data read from files/network sockets, but no explicit source is identified in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions such as print, logging, or network transmissions; specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment, files) to sinks (output, network), but no explicit flow paths are evident in the snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected in the code snippet. However, the code structure, variable usage, or embedded hidden logic cannot be fully assessed without more context.",
  "analysis": "The code was thoroughly examined for common security issues, suspicious behaviors, and obfuscation. No malicious payloads, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activities are apparent from the provided code snippet. It appears to be standard Python code, but without additional context, the risk cannot be definitively assessed. No obfuscation or malware patterns were identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign; however, due to limited context, a definitive security assessment cannot be fully assured.",
