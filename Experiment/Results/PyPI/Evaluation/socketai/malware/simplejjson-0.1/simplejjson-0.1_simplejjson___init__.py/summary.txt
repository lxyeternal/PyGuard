  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking definitive malicious payloads. Scores are mostly justified; the malware score in report 4 should be increased from 0.2 to approximately 0.4-0.5 to better reflect the potential threat. Other reports' scores are appropriate. Continuous monitoring and further analysis are recommended to confirm malicious intent."
