  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on supply chain threats.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution (eval, exec), environment variables, suspicious imports, data flows from untrusted sources, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval or environment variables leading to data exfiltration, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious import patterns, inconsistent data flows, lack of explicit malicious payloads but signs of concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. No concrete malicious payloads or suspicious network activity are observed, but the presence of obfuscation and eval suggests potential concealment. The code's benign appearance in some reports aligns with the absence of malicious actions, while others highlight concerns about data flow and obfuscation. Scores are generally appropriate; however, in reports with obfuscation and dynamic eval, the malware score should be increased slightly to reflect elevated suspicion. The overall risk remains moderate, warranting further static and dynamic analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion but lacking definitive malicious payloads. Scores are mostly justified; the malware score in report 4 should be increased from 0.2 to approximately 0.4-0.5 to better reflect the potential threat. Other reports' scores are appropriate. Continuous monitoring and further analysis are recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
