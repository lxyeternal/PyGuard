{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect and send system information and package details to an external server.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to external URL https://0v0.in/pypi/",
  "flows": "Sources (user, cwd, hostname) → requests.post() payload sent to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual URL endpoint; the code transmits system info without explicit user consent or obvious necessity; no validation or user interaction present",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, gathers system information such as current user, working directory, and hostname, and then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious domain. The URL used ('https://0v0.in/pypi/') is unconventional and could be malicious or used for tracking. The code lacks any indication of user notification or consent. No other malicious or obfuscated code detected. The data transmission could be used for fingerprinting or tracking purposes without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects basic system information and transmits it to an external, potentially malicious server without user consent, indicating suspicious behavior. It may be used for tracking or reconnaissance.",
