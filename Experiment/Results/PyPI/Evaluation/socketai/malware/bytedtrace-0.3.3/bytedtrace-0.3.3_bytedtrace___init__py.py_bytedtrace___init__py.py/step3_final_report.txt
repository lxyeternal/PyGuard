  "purpose": "Collects environment information (user, current working directory, hostname) and transmits it to an external server.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), socket.gethostname()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to external URL",
  "flows": "source functions (getpass.getuser, os.getcwd, socket.gethostname) -> request payload -> requests.post() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Unencrypted transmission of environment info to a suspicious URL without user consent; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly gathers environment data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious domain. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious code execution are detected. The data exfiltration occurs silently without user notification, raising privacy concerns. The URL used is untrusted, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The malware score is low (0), consistent with the absence of malicious payloads. The security risk score is moderate (0.6), reflecting privacy invasion but no active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscated code but performs unsolicited transmission of environment data to an untrusted server, raising privacy and security concerns. The behavior is privacy-invasive but not malicious in intent. The scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, with a security risk around 0.6 due to privacy implications.",
