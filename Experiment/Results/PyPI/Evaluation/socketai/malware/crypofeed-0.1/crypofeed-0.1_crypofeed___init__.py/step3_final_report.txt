{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security posture of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, file/network operations, data handling points, user inputs, environment variables, external URLs.",
  "sinks": "System calls, network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, input handling, and system calls; potential malicious flow if untrusted data reaches sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or benign nature of the code snippets. When code is present, it appears standard, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign analysis. Confidence levels are high where code exists. No anomalies or malicious indicators are observed. The overall assessment indicates minimal risk with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and the code is benign. The scoring and analysis are consistent and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
