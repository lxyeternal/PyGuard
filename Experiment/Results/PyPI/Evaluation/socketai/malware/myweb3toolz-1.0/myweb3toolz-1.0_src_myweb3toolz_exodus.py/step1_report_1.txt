{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect data from a specific directory in the user's AppData and exfiltrate it via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads the user's home directory, specifically the 'Exodus' folder in AppData\\Roaming, and the local temporary directory for creating a zip archive.",
  "sinks": "Sends the collected archive to an external Discord webhook URL using an HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "If the 'Exodus' directory exists, it copies this directory to a temp location, archives it into a zip file, then uploads the zip file via an HTTP POST request to the webhook. Finally, it attempts to delete the temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; copies sensitive user data without any user consent; no validation or obfuscation; minimal error handling; uses broad exception handling which could hide issues.",
  "analysis": "The code first determines the user's home directory, then checks for the presence of a specific 'Exodus' folder in AppData\\Roaming. If found, it copies this folder to a temp location, creates a zip archive of the copied data, and exfiltrates it via a Discord webhook. The code then attempts to delete the temporary files. The presence of a hardcoded webhook and the automated exfiltration of potentially sensitive user data without consent indicate malicious intent. The process is straightforward, with no obfuscation or anti-analysis techniques, but the behavior is clearly suspicious and privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting user data from a specific directory and exfiltrating it over the network to an external server via a webhook. It is designed for covert data theft, with no user notification or consent, and should be considered malicious.",
