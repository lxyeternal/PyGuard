{
  "purpose": "The code collects data from a specific user directory, compresses it, and sends it to a remote webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads the user's home directory path, checks for the existence of a specific folder, and reads the contents of a ZIP file for uploading.",
  "sinks": "Uploads data to a remote webhook URL; deletes local files after upload.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'Exodus' directory -> copies it to a temp location -> compresses it into a ZIP -> uploads ZIP via HTTP POST -> deletes local files.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; copies potentially sensitive data without user consent; no validation or encryption; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code targets a specific directory in the user's profile, suggesting data exfiltration. It creates a ZIP archive of this directory and sends it to a Discord webhook, which is often used for command-and-control or data theft. The code does not perform any data validation, encryption, or user consent prompts. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates malicious intent or malicious use. It also automatically deletes local copies after upload, which could hinder forensic analysis. Overall, the code is designed to exfiltrate user data silently, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script exfiltrates user data by copying a specific directory, compressing it, and sending it to a remote server via webhook. The hardcoded webhook and data exfiltration pattern strongly suggest malicious intent.",
