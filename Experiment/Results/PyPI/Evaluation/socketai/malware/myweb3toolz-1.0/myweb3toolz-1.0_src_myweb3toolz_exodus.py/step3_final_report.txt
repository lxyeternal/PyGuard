{
  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of a specific directory in the user's AppData\\Roaming folder, copies it to a temporary location, compresses it into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. It then attempts to delete the temporary files.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'Exodus' directory in %APPDATA%\\Roaming, opens the ZIP file for reading.",
  "sinks": "Requests.post() to send the ZIP file to the hardcoded webhook URL; file operations for copying, zipping, and deleting files.",
  "flows": "Checks directory existence -> copies directory -> creates ZIP archive -> sends ZIP via HTTP POST to webhook -> deletes temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL; silent operation without user consent; minimal error handling; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a clear data exfiltration process: it searches for a specific directory, copies it, compresses it, and sends it over the network via a hardcoded webhook. The process is silent and lacks user notification or validation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or anti-analysis techniques. The use of broad exception handling could hide errors but is typical in malicious scripts to ensure persistence. The behavior aligns with malicious activity aimed at data theft and privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits unequivocal malicious behavior, exfiltrating user data without consent via a hardcoded webhook. The activity is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and poses a high security risk. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should also be 1, reflecting the severity of the privacy invasion and data theft.",
