{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect and exfiltrate a specific directory (likely containing user data or application data) and send it to a remote webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads the user's home directory path, checks for the existence of the 'Exodus' directory in AppData\\Roaming, and opens the zipped archive for uploading.",
  "sinks": "Sends the collected data via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL. Also performs file deletion after transfer.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'Exodus' directory -> copies it to Temp -> archives it -> uploads via webhook -> deletes local archive and folder.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL pointing to Discord, copying potentially sensitive directories, and exfiltration of data without user consent. The use of broad exception handling suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The script searches for a specific directory in the user's roaming profile, copies its contents to a temporary location, compresses the data, and sends it to a remote server. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating malicious intent for data exfiltration. The code performs no validation or user prompts, and silently handles errors during cleanup, which is typical of malware behavior. Usage of requests for data transmission, combined with file system operations, suggests a data theft operation. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious language features present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to secretly exfiltrate potentially sensitive user data to a remote server via a webhook. It operates covertly by hiding its activities and suppressing errors, with no user notification. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and directory targeting confirm malicious intent.",
