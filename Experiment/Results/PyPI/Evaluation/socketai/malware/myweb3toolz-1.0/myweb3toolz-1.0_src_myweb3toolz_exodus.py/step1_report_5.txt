  "purpose": "The code checks for the existence of a specific directory in the user's AppData, copies it to a temporary location, zips it, and uploads the archive to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists, os.path.expanduser, open(file), requests.post",
  "sinks": "requests.post (data exfiltration), file system operations (copy, remove)",
  "flows": "Detection of directory existence -> copying directory -> creating archive -> uploading archive to webhook -> deleting local files",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL, copies potentially sensitive user data without validation, and exfiltrates data covertly. No user prompts or authorization checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script targets a specific directory in the user's AppData, likely associated with an application or malicious data. If the directory exists, it copies its contents to a temporary folder, compresses it, and then sends the archive to a remote server via a webhook, indicating data exfiltration. The code uses standard modules (os, shutil, requests) but performs suspicious activity by collecting and transmitting user data without consent. The try-except block suppresses errors during file deletion, which could hide failures. No obfuscation or encryption is apparent, but the purpose appears malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to covertly exfiltrate a specific user directory's contents to a remote server, indicating malicious intent. The use of hardcoded webhook and lack of user consent suggest a malicious supply chain activity or malware.",
