{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Steam configuration files and ssfn files, compress them, and send them to a specified Discord webhook, likely for exfiltration of user data.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PROGRAMFILES(X86)), accesses the Steam directory, reads files starting with 'ssfn', reads Steam config directory, reads files within the Steam config folder.",
  "sinks": "Uploads a ZIP file containing Steam data to a Discord webhook URL, writes files into a ZIP archive, deletes the ZIP file after upload.",
  "flows": "Data from Steam configuration files and ssfn files (sources) are written into a ZIP archive, which is then posted over the network to a webhook URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, collecting Steam session files (potentially sensitive), exfiltration of user-specific Steam data without user consent, no validation or encryption of data, minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The script searches for Steam-related files (ssfn and config), packages them into a ZIP archive, and uploads this archive to a Discord webhook URL. The presence of a hardcoded webhook, collection of potentially sensitive Steam session files, and automated exfiltration suggest malicious intent. No user interaction or consent is observed. The code does not perform any validation, encryption, or obfuscation, but its purpose seems to be data theft of Steam credentials or session data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to clandestinely collect and transmit Steam user data to an external server via Discord webhook, which indicates malicious behavior. It functions as a data exfiltration tool targeting Steam session files and configuration data.",
