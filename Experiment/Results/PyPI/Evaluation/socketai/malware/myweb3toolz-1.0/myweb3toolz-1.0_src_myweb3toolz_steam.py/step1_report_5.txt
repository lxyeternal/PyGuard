{
  "purpose": "The script collects specific Steam-related files and configurations, zips them, and sends the data to a remote Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'PROGRAMFILES(X86)', 'TEMP'), directory listing of Steam files, ZIP file creation, and file reads (steam_session.zip).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a remote webhook URL with the zipped data, file deletion command.",
  "flows": "Reads Steam configuration and SSFN files -> Creates a ZIP archive with these files -> Sends ZIP data via POST request to webhook -> Deletes temporary ZIP file.",
  "anomalies": "Code gathers potentially sensitive user data (Steam configuration and SSFN files), creates an archive, and transmits it to an external server without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code does not validate or inform the user.",
  "analysis": "The code identifies the Steam installation directory through environment variables, collects SSFN and config files, and zips them. It then posts the ZIP file to a specified Discord webhook. This behavior resembles data exfiltration of potentially sensitive Steam user data, which could be used for malicious purposes such as account hijacking or credential theft. No obfuscated code or malicious system modifications are present, but the intent to silently collect and transmit user data is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be malicious or at least maliciously intended, as it silently exfiltrates potentially sensitive user data to an external server. The behavior suggests it could be part of a malware or phishing operation aimed at stealing Steam account information.",
