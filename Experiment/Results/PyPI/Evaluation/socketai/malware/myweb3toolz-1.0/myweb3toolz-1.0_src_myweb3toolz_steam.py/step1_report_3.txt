{
  "purpose": "The code collects Steam configuration and SSFN files, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and sends the archive to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "os.environ (reads environment variables), os.listdir (reads directory contents), os.walk (reads file system), open (reads files for zipping)",
  "sinks": "requests.post (sends data to external URL), file.write (writes files into ZIP archive), os.remove (deletes temporary ZIP file)",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, directory listing) -> file collection (SSFN and config files) -> zipping files -> POST request to webhook URL with ZIP file",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, collection of potentially sensitive Steam files, absence of user consent, no validation or encryption, direct transmission of files over HTTP POST",
  "analysis": "The script identifies and collects Steam user data files (ssfn and config files), compresses these files into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates them to an external server via a webhook. The code does not validate or sanitize input, and it operates silently. The hardcoded webhook URL indicates intentional data exfiltration. The script runs without user awareness, which is typical in malicious data theft or spying activities. The use of environment variables to locate Steam files and the automatic removal of the ZIP file after upload suggests an attempt to hide activity. There is no evidence of obfuscation or additional malicious code such as reverse shells, privilege escalation, or network infiltration beyond the data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be malicious in intent, designed to exfiltrate sensitive Steam user files to an external server. The presence of a hardcoded webhook, collection of user-specific files without user consent, and silent operation all point toward malicious activity. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but clearly aimed at data theft.",
