{
  "purpose": "The code collects Steam session files (ssfn*) and configuration files from the Steam directory, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates this archive to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent or validation.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables for Steam directory, listing files in the Steam directory, reading files starting with 'ssfn', reading the 'config' directory, opening the temporary ZIP file, and reading the ZIP file for upload.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to the hardcoded Discord webhook URL with the ZIP file, file deletion from the TEMP directory.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and directory listing → file collection (ssfn* and config files) → compression into ZIP → HTTP POST request to webhook with ZIP file → deletion of ZIP file.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, collection of sensitive user files without consent, lack of validation or encryption, minimal error handling, code straightforwardness indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unauthorized collection of sensitive Steam session and configuration files, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates this archive via a hardcoded webhook URL. It operates silently, with no user notification or consent, and lacks obfuscation or encryption. The code assumes the existence of environment variables and directories without validation, but these are minor issues compared to its primary malicious activity. The data exfiltration of user-specific files indicates malicious intent, justified by the high malware and security risk scores. The straightforward nature of the code and the absence of obfuscation support a low obfuscated score. The activity aligns with typical data theft malware, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious data exfiltration script targeting Steam user data, with high confidence in its malicious intent and security risk. The activity involves unauthorized collection and transmission of sensitive files to an external server, justified by high malware and risk scores. The code's straightforwardness and lack of obfuscation support a low obfuscated score. Overall, it poses a significant security threat due to privacy invasion and potential credential theft.",
