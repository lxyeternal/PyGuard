{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Steam configuration and session files, compress them into a zip archive, and send the archive to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), os.listdir, os.walk, and file operations in the TEMP directory",
  "sinks": "requests.post to send data to external webhook, file.write operations, and file removal from TEMP directory",
  "flows": "Reads Steam-related files from the user's system, compresses and uploads these files to an external server (Discord webhook), then deletes the archive",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, collection of potentially sensitive Steam data (ssfn files and config), no user consent or notification, collection of user files without clear purpose",
  "analysis": "The script checks for Steam installation and gathers specific session and configuration files, likely to steal user login/session data. It then compresses these files and sends them to an external server via a webhook, which could be malicious. The code structure is straightforward but employs hardcoded secrets and performs unauthorized data exfiltration without user awareness. No obfuscation detected, but the intent appears malicious due to data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It collects Steam session/config data and exfiltrates it to an external webhook, which indicates a potential credential theft or privacy invasion. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and the nature of data collection strongly suggest malicious intent.",
