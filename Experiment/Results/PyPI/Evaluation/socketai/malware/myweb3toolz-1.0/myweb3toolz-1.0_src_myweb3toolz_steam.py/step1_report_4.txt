{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Steam configuration files and session data, compress them into a ZIP file, and send this data to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (PROGRAMFILES(X86), TEMP), listing files in Steam directory, reading files within the Steam config directory.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to a Discord webhook with the ZIP file, writing files to zip archive, deleting the ZIP file from disk.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Steam directory and config files -> Files read into ZIP archive -> ZIP file sent via HTTP POST -> ZIP file deleted.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects potentially sensitive files such as Steam session and config data and transmits them to an external server without user consent or notification. No input validation or authentication is present; it operates silently. The URL is hardcoded, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for the existence of Steam directory in Program Files, gathers session files and config data, compresses these files into a ZIP archive, and sends it to an external webhook URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration. The code uses hardcoded environment variable keys and paths, and lacks user prompts or safeguards, which are suspicious. The flow of sensitive data from local storage to an external server indicates malicious intent to steal user information. The code appears straightforward without obfuscation but is intentionally designed to exfiltrate data silently.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior, primarily data exfiltration of Steam user data to an external webhook. It does not contain obfuscation but performs suspicious activities that compromise user privacy and security.",
