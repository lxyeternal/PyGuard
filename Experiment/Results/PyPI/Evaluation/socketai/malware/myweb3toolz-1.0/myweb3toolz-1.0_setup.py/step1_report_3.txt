  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'myweb3toolz'.",
  "sources": "Input data from package metadata (name, version, author info, dependencies), and package discovery from 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or used unsafely.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; dependencies are declared statically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard setup tools and dependencies without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools. It specifies package info, dependencies, and package locations. No code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs at runtime. All dependencies are listed explicitly, with no unusual or suspicious packages. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a typical, benign configuration file for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
