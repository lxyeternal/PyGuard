  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- Declares package metadata: name, version, author, email, URL, keywords.\n- Finds packages in `'src'` directory.\n- Specifies dependencies: `'requests'`, `'Pillow'`, `'pywin32'`.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious content.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, static, and benign.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The dependencies are common and benign.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0`, consistent with clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign `0`, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code does not execute any untrusted data.\n- It does not perform any network activity or code injection.\n- Dependencies are standard packages, not suspicious.\n- No dynamic or obfuscated code present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The dependencies are common, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action is necessary.",
