  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for Python packaging using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() function: package metadata, find_packages('src'), install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data processing, user input, or network operations; dependencies are standard packages.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that specifies package info and dependencies without dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All dependencies are common, benign packages. No suspicious behaviors, code injection, or runtime data handling are present. The code structure is clear, and the metadata is typical for Python packages. The dependencies, including platform-specific 'pywin32', do not indicate malicious intent but are noted as platform-specific. The overall code is static and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
