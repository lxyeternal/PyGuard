  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'myweb3toolz'.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements from 'install_requires' and metadata such as name, version, author, and URL.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used in a harmful way. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious code executions are present.",
  "flows": "Package metadata and dependencies are declared statically; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pywin32' dependency may be platform-specific but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It specifies package information, author details, dependencies, and package directories. No malicious patterns such as code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. All dependencies and metadata appear legitimate for a typical Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup code is legitimate and contains no signs of malicious behavior. It is a standard package configuration script with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
