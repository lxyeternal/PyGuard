{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user data from various web browsers, including saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, browsing history, and downloads, then archive and exfiltrate this data via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA), filesystem paths to browser data directories, database files (Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History), and local files containing encrypted data.",
  "sinks": "Uploading the archive of collected data to an external server via an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data is read from browser databases and local state files, decrypted using master keys and cryptographic functions, saved temporarily on disk, archived into a ZIP file, and then uploaded over the network to an external webhook endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any user interaction, encrypts data with a known webhook URL, copies sensitive data without user consent, and automatically exfiltrates information to an external server. It uses modules like win32crypt and Crypto.Cipher for decryption, indicating an intent to access protected data. It also creates temporary directories and files silently. The code structure resembles typical malware behavior, especially given its focus on extracting and transmitting sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive credential and data stealer targeting multiple browsers, leveraging local system data and encrypted credentials. It decrypts passwords, cookies, credit card info, and browsing history, then packages and exfiltrates this data via a Discord webhook. The use of decrypt functions, copying of browser database files, and automated data collection without user consent are indicative of malicious intent. The final step uploads the data in a ZIP archive to an external server, confirming its role as a malicious data exfiltration tool. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malware designed for stealth and data theft, with no legitimate user-oriented functionality.\n",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, acting as a credential and data stealer targeting browser data. It collects sensitive user information, decompresses encrypted data, and exfiltrates it covertly to an external webhook, indicating high malicious intent. Its operations are consistent with malware behavior, and it should be considered dangerous for any environment where it runs.",
