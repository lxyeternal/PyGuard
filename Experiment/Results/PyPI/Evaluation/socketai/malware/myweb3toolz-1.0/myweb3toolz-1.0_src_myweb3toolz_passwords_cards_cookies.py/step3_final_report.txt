{
  "purpose": "The code extracts sensitive browser data such as passwords, cookies, credit cards, browsing history, and downloads, then compresses and exfiltrates this data via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Browser data directories, Local State files, database files (Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History, Downloads).",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL with the ZIP archive containing the stolen data.",
  "flows": "Reads data from browser files, decrypts stored credentials using Windows cryptography and AES, saves data into text files, archives into ZIP, then uploads to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Silent operation without user consent, copying database files without notification, use of hardcoded webhook URL, decrypting protected data, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically locates browser data directories, decrypts stored credentials and cookies, and collects browsing history and downloads. It stores all extracted data into text files within a temp directory, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates via a webhook. The code operates stealthily, with no user prompts, and deletes temporary files after use. Its behavior aligns with typical credential-stealing malware. The decryption routines use Windows APIs and AES, indicating it targets Windows systems. The absence of obfuscation and straightforward structure further confirm malicious intent. The exfiltration of sensitive data to an external server (Discord webhook) is a clear malicious act.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a credential and data stealer, exfiltrating sensitive user information from browsers to an external server. Its behavior is malicious, designed for stealthy data theft, and it poses a high security threat.",
