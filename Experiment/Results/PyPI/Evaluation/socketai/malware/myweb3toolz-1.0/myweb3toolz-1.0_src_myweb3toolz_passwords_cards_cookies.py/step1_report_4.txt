{
  "purpose": "This script extracts sensitive user data from web browsers, including passwords, cookies, credit card info, browsing history, and downloads, then compresses and exfiltrates it via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "File system paths for browser data directories, specific database files (Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History), environment variables, and user directories.",
  "sinks": "Network POST request to a Discord webhook endpoint with the collected and zipped user data.",
  "flows": "Data is read from browser database files (sources), decrypted, formatted into text, saved temporarily, zipped, and then sent via HTTP POST (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The script bypasses typical user prompts, copies sensitive database files without user consent, and immediately exfiltrates data to an external server. It uses potentially malicious encryption/decryption routines, hardcoded webhook URL, and temporary files for data extraction and transfer.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses multiple browser data directories, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows cryptography APIs and AES, and collects browsing history, download history, and credit card info. It uses environment variables and user directories to locate data files. The data is written to local temp folders, compressed into a ZIP archive, and sent via a Discord webhook. The script appears designed to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive information. The use of hardcoded webhook URL, copying database files without permission, and encryption routines suggest malicious intent. There is no evidence of obfuscation or benign functionality. Overall, the script is crafted for malicious data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in intent, designed to silently steal and exfiltrate sensitive user data from browsers. It employs standard techniques for data extraction and exfiltration but does so without user consent, indicating a clear malicious purpose.",
