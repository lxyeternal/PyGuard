{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, cookies, browsing history, and download history from various web browsers and then exfiltrate this data by uploading it to a remote Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local app data directories, and browser database files (Login Data, Web Data, Cookies, History). Uses file copying and SQLite database queries to access stored data.",
  "sinks": "Uploads collected data as a ZIP file via HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL. Writes data to local files temporarily before uploading.",
  "flows": "Data is extracted from browser databases (sources), written to temporary files, compiled into a ZIP archive, and then sent over the network to the specified webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The script actively searches for and decrypts stored passwords, credit card info, cookies, and history, then exfiltrates all this data without user consent. It uses hardcoded webhook URL and temp file paths, indicating malicious intent. Uses Windows-specific cryptography functions and bypasses user privacy protections.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically accesses multiple browser directories and databases to extract sensitive user data, decrypts encrypted information using master keys, and then stores this data locally. It then compresses all the data into an archive and uploads it to an external server via a webhook. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL, combined with the extensive data harvesting from user browsers, strongly suggests malicious activity aimed at unauthorized data theft and surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious in intent, designed to covertly steal sensitive user data and exfiltrate it via a remote webhook. Its behavior aligns with typical info-stealer malware. The code has no benign purpose and actively compromises user privacy and security.",
