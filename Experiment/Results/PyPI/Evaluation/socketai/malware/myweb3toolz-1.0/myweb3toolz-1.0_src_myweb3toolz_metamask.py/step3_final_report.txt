  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates browser extension data, including sensitive wallet information, by copying directories, archiving them, and sending the data via a webhook for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": [
    "User directories related to browser extension settings and local storage, specifically targeting extension IDs associated with wallet data (e.g., 'nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn')."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, transmitting ZIP archives containing exfiltrated data."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Access user directories -> copy directories -> create ZIP archive if copying fails -> send archive via POST request to webhook."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Silent error handling with broad try-except blocks, no user consent or validation, and hardcoded webhook URL indicating covert exfiltration.",
    "Targeting of sensitive directories associated with cryptocurrency wallets without user awareness."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script targets specific browser extension directories, especially those linked to crypto wallets like MetaMask, copying their contents into a temporary folder. If copying fails, it archives the data into ZIP files. It then uploads these ZIPs to a predefined Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating potentially sensitive user data without consent. The code operates silently, with broad exception handling, and lacks validation or user prompts, indicating malicious intent. The straightforward logic and clear data exfiltration pattern confirm malicious behavior. The code is not obfuscated, and the use of hardcoded webhook further supports malicious activity. Overall, the script functions as a covert data theft tool targeting sensitive user information, especially wallet data, with high potential for privacy invasion and financial theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covert exfiltration of sensitive browser extension data, including cryptocurrency wallet information. It operates silently, with no user consent, and communicates with a hardcoded webhook. The behavior aligns with data theft and privacy invasion, warranting a malware score of 1, a security risk score of 1, and an obfuscated score of 0. The overall threat level is high, and the code should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
