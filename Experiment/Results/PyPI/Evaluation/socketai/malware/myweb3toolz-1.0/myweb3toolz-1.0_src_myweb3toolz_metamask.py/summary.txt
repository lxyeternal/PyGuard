  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covert exfiltration of sensitive browser extension data, including cryptocurrency wallet information. It operates silently, with no user consent, and communicates with a hardcoded webhook. The behavior aligns with data theft and privacy invasion, warranting a malware score of 1, a security risk score of 1, and an obfuscated score of 0. The overall threat level is high, and the code should be considered malicious and unsafe for use."
