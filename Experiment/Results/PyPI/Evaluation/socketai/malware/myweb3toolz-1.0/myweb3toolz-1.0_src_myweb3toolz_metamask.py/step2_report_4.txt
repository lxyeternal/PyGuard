  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose:** Exfiltrates browser extension data via webhook.  \n**Sources:** User directories with extension data.  \n**Sinks:** Requests to Discord webhook, zip archives.  \n**Flow:** Copy directories → archive → send.  \n**Anomalies:** Accesses sensitive directories, no user consent, exfiltration evident.  \n**Analysis:** Clear malicious intent; copies user data and exfiltrates via webhook.  \n**Conclusion:** Malicious data theft.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 1 (appropriate, as behavior is malicious)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Security Risk: 1 (high risk due to data exfiltration)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, exfiltrates browser extension data.  \n**Sources:** Filesystem paths with extension data, including sensitive info like crypto wallets.  \n**Sinks:** Upload via webhook, filesystem operations.  \n**Flow:** Copy → archive → upload.  \n**Anomalies:** Silent copying, error handling, no user consent.  \n**Analysis:** Same malicious pattern, focused on sensitive data.  \n**Conclusion:** Data theft, malicious.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.9 (very high, behavior is malicious)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- Security Risk: 0.9 (serious risk)\n\n**Potential Adjustment:** Given the behavior, a score of 1 for malware and security risk would be justified. But 0.9 is acceptable if considering slight room for uncertainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable, but I suggest **malware = 1** and **securityRisk = 1** for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose:** Exfiltrates crypto wallet extension data.  \n**Sources:** Specific directories, notably 'nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn' (MetaMask).  \n**Sinks:** Upload via webhook.  \n**Flow:** Copy/Archive → send.  \n**Anomalies:** Targeted sensitive data, no consent, silent operation.  \n**Analysis:** Highly malicious, aimed at wallet data theft.  \n**Conclusion:** Malicious exfiltration.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 1 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 1\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose:** Similar, exfiltrates browser extension data, especially wallet info.  \n**Sources:** Extension directories, especially 'nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn'.  \n**Sinks:** Uploads ZIPs via webhook.  \n**Flow:** Copy → archive → send.  \n**Anomalies:** Silent error handling, no user consent, potential repeated exfiltration.  \n**Analysis:** Clear malicious intent, targeting sensitive wallet data.  \n**Conclusion:** Malicious exfiltration.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.9 (very high, behavior is malicious)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 1\n\n**Suggestion:** Given the malicious nature, I recommend **malware = 1** and **securityRisk = 1** for full consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify malicious exfiltration behavior.\n- The scores for malware and security risk are slightly below 1 in some reports, but given the clear malicious intent, I recommend setting **malware = 1** and **securityRisk = 1** across all reports.\n- Obfuscation remains 0, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimations:\n**Malware score:** 1 (all reports describe malicious exfiltration)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** 1 (high security risk due to data theft)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code does not contain obfuscation or evasive techniques.\n- The behavior is straightforward exfiltration of sensitive data, especially targeting crypto wallets.\n- The consistent use of hardcoded webhook and silent error handling suggests malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify malicious activity. I would rate the overall malware score as **1**, obfuscation as **0**, and security risk as **1** for this sample.",
