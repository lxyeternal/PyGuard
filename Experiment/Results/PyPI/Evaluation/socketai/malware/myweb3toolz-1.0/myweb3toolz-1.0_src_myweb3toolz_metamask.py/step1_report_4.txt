It copies these directories into a temporary location, archives them into ZIP files, and uploads them to a Discord webhook. This behavior resembles data theft or exfiltration, especially of sensitive browser extension data that could contain wallet information or personal data. The code does not perform any obvious malicious actions like file destruction or command execution but focuses on collecting and transmitting data, which can be malicious in context.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This code is highly suspicious as it collects browser-related data and exfiltrates it via a webhook, likely without user consent. It resembles a credential or private data harvesting malware component. The use of hardcoded webhook and the targeted directories strongly suggest malicious intent for information theft.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0.9,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.85\n}",
