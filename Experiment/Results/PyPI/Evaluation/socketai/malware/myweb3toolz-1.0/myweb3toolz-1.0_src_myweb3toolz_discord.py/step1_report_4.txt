{
  "purpose": "The code searches for Discord tokens and other similar tokens stored on the local machine across various browser and application directories, then sends any found tokens to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), accesses file systems in specific directories related to browsers and applications, reads log, database, and storage files (.log, .ldb, .sqlite, .sqlite3).",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with collected tokens included in the message payload.",
  "flows": "Collects tokens from various local storage files (sources) by regex pattern matching, then sends these tokens directly to the webhook URL (sink) in JSON format.",
  "anomalies": "The script is designed to collect tokens stealthily from user environments and exfiltrate them to an external server without user consent. Hardcoded webhook URL, no validation or user interaction, and scanning multiple application directories are suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically searches specific directories related to Discord, browsers, and other applications for strings matching Discord token patterns. It accumulates these tokens into a list, avoiding duplicates. It then constructs a payload containing the tokens and sends it via a POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code operates silently without user awareness, indicating intent to exfiltrate sensitive credentials. No obfuscation or encryption is evident; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent due to credential theft and exfiltration functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious as it steals Discord tokens and other credentials from local storage and exfiltrates them to an attacker-controlled webhook. Its purpose aligns with credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration. No obfuscation detected, but the functionality is malicious and poses a significant security threat.",
