{
  "purpose": "The script searches user profile directories for Discord tokens across various browsers and applications, and then sends any found tokens to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), filesystem directories containing user data, and log/database files within those directories.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with token data embedded in a JSON payload.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment variables and file contents (sources), extracts tokens via regex patterns, then sends the tokens via a POST request to the webhook (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL (potential for command and control or data exfiltration), use of regex patterns to extract tokens, no user consent or notification, and the script appears designed to collect and exfiltrate tokens without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive authentication tokens stored in various user directories related to Discord and browsers. It searches for strings matching token formats using regex. Found tokens are compiled into a JSON payload and sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code does not ask for permission or notify the user. It performs file system access and network activity with malicious intent, likely for credential theft or unauthorized access. The inclusion of the webhook URL and token extraction indicates malicious data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to steal user tokens and exfiltrate them to an external server via a Discord webhook. It operates without user consent, accessing sensitive directories and sending data externally, representing a significant security threat.",
