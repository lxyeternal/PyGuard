{
  "purpose": "The code searches for Discord tokens and other similar tokens across various browser and application data directories, then sends the collected tokens to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), file system directories related to browsers and applications, and log/leveldb/sqlite files within these directories.",
  "sinks": "Sending token data via HTTP POST request to an external Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Directory path construction -> File reading and regex extraction -> Token collection -> JSON payload creation -> HTTP POST request to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively searches for tokens in multiple application data directories, which is typical of credential-stealing malware. The webhook URL is hardcoded and used to exfiltrate tokens without user consent. No validation or obfuscation is present. The code runs without any user interaction and silently exfiltrates sensitive information.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs paths to various application data directories based on environment variables. It scans specific file types (.log, .ldb, .sqlite) for strings matching Discord token patterns using regex. Extracted tokens are stored uniquely. Finally, it sends these tokens to a hardcoded Discord webhook, effectively exfiltrating sensitive credentials. The behavior suggests malicious intent, aiming to harvest user tokens stealthily and transmit them to an attacker-controlled server.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for credential harvesting by extracting Discord tokens from local data storage and exfiltrating them via a webhook. It exhibits malicious behavior intended to steal user credentials without consent, indicating high malicious intent and significant security risk.",
