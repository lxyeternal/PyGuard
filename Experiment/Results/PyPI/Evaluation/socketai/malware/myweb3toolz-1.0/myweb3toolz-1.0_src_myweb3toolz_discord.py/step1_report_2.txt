{
  "purpose": "The code searches for Discord tokens and other sensitive tokens stored on the local system and sends them to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), reading files in local Storage/leveldb directories of various browsers and applications.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with collected tokens embedded in a message payload.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from environment variables and local storage files, tokens are extracted using regex, then all tokens are sent via a POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any validation or encryption of the tokens before sending. It scans multiple application directories for tokens, implying an intent to exfiltrate sensitive data. The webhook URL is hardcoded. No user prompts or safeguards are present. No logging or error handling is visible.",
  "analysis": "The script identifies potential token locations across various browsers and Discord-related directories by checking for specific path existence. It then reads through relevant files (.log, .ldb, .sqlite) line by line, searching for patterns resembling Discord or MFA tokens via regex. All found tokens are collected into a list. The code then constructs a JSON payload with the tokens and sends it to a predefined Discord webhook, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user tokens without user consent. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and lack of any obfuscation or user notification suggests malicious intent aimed at data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a token stealer, harvesting Discord and MFA tokens from various user application data locations and exfiltrating them to a remote server via a webhook. It exhibits malicious behavior with no legitimate user-oriented purpose, indicating high malicious intent.",
