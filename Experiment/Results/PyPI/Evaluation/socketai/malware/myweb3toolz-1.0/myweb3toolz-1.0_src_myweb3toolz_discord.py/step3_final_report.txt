{
  "purpose": "The code searches various user directories for Discord and other tokens, extracts them using regex, and exfiltrates the tokens via a hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (localAPPDATA, APPDATA), files in local storage directories, log/ldb/sqlite files, lines read from these files.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL with token data embedded in JSON payload.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> constructs paths -> scans files for regex matches -> collects tokens -> sends tokens via HTTP POST to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or encryption of tokens, no user notification, straightforward token exfiltration, use of hardcoded webhook URL, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs credential harvesting by scanning user data directories for Discord and MFA tokens using regex patterns. It reads multiple file types (.log, .ldb, .sqlite) from specific paths derived from environment variables. Extracted tokens are stored uniquely and then sent via a POST request to a fixed webhook URL. The process is silent, with no user notification or encryption, indicating malicious intent. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or anti-analysis measures. Its behavior aligns with credential-stealing malware designed to exfiltrate sensitive tokens without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, actively harvesting Discord and MFA tokens from user directories and exfiltrating them via a hardcoded webhook. It exhibits clear credential theft behavior with no obfuscation. The behavior warrants a maximum malware score and high security risk score, with a low obfuscation score.",
