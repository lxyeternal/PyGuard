  "purpose": "Capture a single image frame from the default webcam and save it as 'image.png'.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0) to open webcam, cap.read() to read frame.",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite() to save the captured frame locally.",
  "flows": "Webcam input (source) -> frame read -> saved to file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward webcam capture and save operation; no obfuscation, network activity, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the webcam, captures one frame, saves it as 'image.png', and releases resources. All reports confirm this benign functionality. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. No evidence suggests any security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign webcam image capture script with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
