  "purpose": "Capture an image from the default camera and save it as 'image.png'.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0), cap.read()",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite('image.png', frame)",
  "flows": "Video capture input -> frame data -> saved as image.png",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes the webcam, captures a single frame, saves it as an image file, and then releases the webcam resources. It uses standard OpenCV functions without any obfuscated or suspicious logic. No data leakage, no network activity, no environment variable misuse, and no malicious code is present. The code performs a straightforward task of image capture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple implementation for capturing an image from the webcam. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended for legitimate purposes.",
