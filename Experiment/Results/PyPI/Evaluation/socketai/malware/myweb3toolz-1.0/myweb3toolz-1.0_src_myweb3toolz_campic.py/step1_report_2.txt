  "purpose": "Capture an image from the default webcam and save it as 'image.png'.",
  "sources": "cv2.VideoCapture(0) initiates webcam stream, cap.read() reads a frame from the webcam.",
  "sinks": "cv2.imwrite('image.png', frame) writes the captured frame to disk.",
  "flows": "Webcam stream (source) provides data to cap.read(), which outputs 'frame'; frame is then saved to disk via cv2.imwrite.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials; standard OpenCV usage for image capture.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes webcam capture, reads a single frame, saves it to a file, and releases resources. There are no external data transmissions, obfuscated code, or malicious actions. The use of OpenCV for capturing and saving images is straightforward and common in legitimate applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple webcam image capture script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
