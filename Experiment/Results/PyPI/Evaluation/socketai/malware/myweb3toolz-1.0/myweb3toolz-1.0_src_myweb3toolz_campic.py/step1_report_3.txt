  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; standard webcam capture process.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes webcam capture, reads a single frame, saves it as 'image.png', and releases resources. No data is transmitted over the network or used in malicious ways. The operations are typical for capturing and saving an image, with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
