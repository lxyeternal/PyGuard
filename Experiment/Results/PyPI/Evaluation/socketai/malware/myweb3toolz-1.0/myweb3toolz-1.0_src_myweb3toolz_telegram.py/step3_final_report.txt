  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate Telegram Desktop session data by copying the 'tdata' folder, archiving it, and sending it via a webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads the user's Telegram session data from the AppData directory; reads the 'tdata' folder; accesses the hardcoded webhook URL; reads the ZIP file for upload.",
  "sinks": "Requests.post to the webhook URL with the ZIP file; file operations like copying and archiving; potential for data leakage via network request.",
  "flows": "Checks for Telegram data -> copies data to temp directory -> archives data into ZIP -> opens ZIP file -> sends ZIP via HTTP POST to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Function 'telegram()' is defined but not invoked (commented out); broad exception handling with no logging; hardcoded webhook URL; silent failure handling; no user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly targets Telegram session data, copying and exfiltrating it via a webhook, which is malicious. Despite the function being commented out, the code's structure indicates malicious intent and capability. The use of broad exception handling and silent failures suggests an attempt to hide errors. The straightforward nature of the code and the hardcoded webhook URL are typical of malware designed for data theft. The absence of obfuscation and the commented-out function imply it is inactive unless invoked elsewhere, but the design intent remains malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, intended for data exfiltration of Telegram sessions. The function is not called in the provided snippet, so it is inactive as-is, but the code structure indicates it could be activated. The high malware and security risk scores are justified by its intent and potential harm.",
