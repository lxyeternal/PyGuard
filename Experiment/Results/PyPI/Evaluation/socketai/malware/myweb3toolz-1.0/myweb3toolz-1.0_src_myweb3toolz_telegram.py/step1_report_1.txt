{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect Telegram Desktop session data and send it to a specified Discord webhook, likely for malicious purposes such as stealing user data.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists(), shutil.copytree(), environment variables (user), open(), requests.post()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() (sending data over the network), file operations (reading Telegram data archive)",
  "flows": "checks if Telegram data exists -> copies Telegram data directory -> archives the data -> sends the archive via HTTP POST to webhook",
  "anomalies": "The code is designed to extract sensitive Telegram session data and upload it to an external server, which is suspicious behavior. The function 'telegram' is defined but not called, possibly indicating obfuscation or incomplete implementation. Use of try/except blocks without logging and silent failures is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and requests. It constructs a path to Telegram session data and, if present, attempts to copy it to a temporary directory, archive it as a zip file, and then send it to a remote webhook URL. The key malicious behavior is the extraction and exfiltration of Telegram session data. The function is not invoked, but that may be intentional or an omission. No other benign purpose is evident. The code's structure suggests an intent to exfiltrate user data without consent, which is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to steal Telegram session data and exfiltrate it to an external server via webhook, which constitutes malicious behavior. It exhibits typical data exfiltration techniques and suspicious handling of sensitive data.",
