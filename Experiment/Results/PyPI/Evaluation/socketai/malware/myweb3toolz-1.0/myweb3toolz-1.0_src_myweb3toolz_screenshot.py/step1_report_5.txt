  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and send it via a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser to get the user directory, ImageGrab.grab() to capture screen, open() to read the saved image file.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to send the image file to the webhook URL, os.remove() to delete the screenshot after sending.",
  "flows": "Screenshot is taken (source), saved to temp directory, then uploaded via HTTP POST (sink), and finally deleted.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Discord webhook URL, no validation or encryption of data, no user consent or notification, potential for misuse as a screenshot logger.",
  "analysis": "The code captures the user's screen and immediately uploads the image to a specified Discord webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which indicates potential malicious intent or misuse. The process involves no user interaction or permission checks, and the screenshot is deleted afterward. No obfuscation or suspicious language features are present; however, the behavior of silently capturing and transmitting user screenshots without consent is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a screenshot logger that transmits user screen captures to a specified external endpoint without user consent. It has a high malicious behavior score due to its stealthy data exfiltration purpose, and it presents a security risk because of the lack of user awareness and control.",
