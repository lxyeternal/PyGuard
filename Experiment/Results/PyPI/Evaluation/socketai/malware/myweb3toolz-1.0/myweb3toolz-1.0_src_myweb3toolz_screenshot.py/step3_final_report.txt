{
  "purpose": "The code captures a screenshot of the user's desktop and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent.",
  "sources": "os.path.expanduser, ImageGrab.grab(), open(), requests.post()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() (network transmission), open() (file access), os.remove() (file deletion)",
  "flows": "Capture screenshot -> save to temp file -> open file -> send via POST request -> delete file",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, no user notification or consent, no error handling for network or file operations",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly captures a desktop screenshot, saves it locally, and uploads it to a remote server using a hardcoded URL, then deletes the local file. The absence of user consent, combined with the exfiltration behavior, indicates malicious intent. The code is not obfuscated, and all operations are direct. The webhook URL is publicly visible, increasing security concerns. Error handling is minimal, but this does not mitigate the malicious activity. The behavior aligns with privacy-invasive malware, such as spyware or remote surveillance tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert screenshot exfiltration to a remote server without user consent, indicating malicious behavior. The activity justifies a high malware score (~0.8) and security risk (~0.8), with no obfuscation present.",
