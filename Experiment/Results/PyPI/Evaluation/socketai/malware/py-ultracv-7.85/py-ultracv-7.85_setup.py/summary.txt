  "conclusion": "The code contains active malicious behavior through obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with a suspicious URL and covert execution tactics. The high scores assigned are appropriate, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. The package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious until further payload analysis confirms benignity."
