  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and safe; any malicious activity depends on the implementation of 'init_helper', which is outside this scope. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. No obfuscation is present. The overall assessment indicates minimal risk based solely on this code."
