  "flows": "No data flows; only an import statement establishing a namespace or dependency",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import statement with no embedded code, secrets, or dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package init file that imports a single function or object from a sibling module. It does not contain executable code beyond the import statement. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity are evident. The minimal content reduces risk of hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an import point for package initialization. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security concerns in this snippet.",
