  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a simple import statement in a __init__.py file.\n- The code is straightforward: `from .helper import init_helper`.\n- No dynamic code, no data handling, no user input, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- The code's purpose is standard package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard import statement.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Scores assigned to issues?**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk scores are very low or zero. These are reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. There's no malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Most reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, these are reasonable.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  Mostly 1, with one report at 0.9, which is acceptable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all conclusions are based on the code's simplicity.  \n- The import statement itself is standard; unless the `helper.py` module contains malicious code (which cannot be determined from this snippet), there's no cause for concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate given the code's benign nature)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nIf I were to assign an overall estimate considering the entire context, I would concur with the current scores. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and standard for Python package initialization.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and conclusions. The code poses no security threat based on the provided snippet.",
