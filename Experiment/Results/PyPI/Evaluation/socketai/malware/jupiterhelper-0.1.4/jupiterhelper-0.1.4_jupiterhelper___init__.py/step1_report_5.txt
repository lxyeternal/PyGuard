  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing the 'init_helper' function or object from the helper module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'init_helper' from the local 'helper' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the import is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement intended to set up the package namespace. It imports 'init_helper' from a local module, which is a common pattern for package initialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code does not interact with external data, environment variables, or perform any actions beyond a straightforward import.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard for Python package initialization, and poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
