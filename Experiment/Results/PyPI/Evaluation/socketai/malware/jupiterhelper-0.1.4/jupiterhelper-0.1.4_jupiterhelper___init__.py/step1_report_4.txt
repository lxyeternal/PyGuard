  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or potential data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple import statement with no additional logic",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement, which is standard for module initialization. It does not read any input or handle data, nor does it execute any dynamic code or contain suspicious behavior. There is no evidence of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
