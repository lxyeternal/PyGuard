  "purpose": "A simple import statement in a Python package's __init__.py file, used for package initialization.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the import could execute code in helper.py, but this is standard behavior.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads helper module; no data flow from untrusted sources is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static import in a package's __init__.py, which is typical for Python packages. No dynamic execution, data handling, or suspicious activity is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The potential concern that importing a module can execute code is standard and not malicious unless helper.py contains malicious code, which cannot be determined from this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization with no malicious or security issues. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
