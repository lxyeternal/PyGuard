{
  "purpose": "This module appears to initialize or import a helper component for the Jupiter project, likely to be used as part of the package's setup or import process.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .helper module",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import from .helper module, which may execute or load code during import",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets detected; very simple import statement",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a function or object named init_helper from a local helper module. There are no inputs, data processing, or potentially dangerous code. The import itself could execute code in helper.py, but based on this snippet alone, there's no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement initializing helper functions or classes, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
