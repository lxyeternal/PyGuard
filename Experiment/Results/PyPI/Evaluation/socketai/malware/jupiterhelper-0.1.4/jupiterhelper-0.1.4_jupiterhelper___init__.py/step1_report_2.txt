  "purpose": "To initialize the package by importing the 'init_helper' function from the 'helper' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.helper' module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports a function",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input handling observed",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, straightforward import; no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module, which is typical for package initialization. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns. The simplicity suggests this is a standard package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an initializer for the package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
