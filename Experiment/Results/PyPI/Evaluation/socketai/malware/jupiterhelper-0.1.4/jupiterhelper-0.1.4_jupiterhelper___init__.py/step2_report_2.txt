  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a simple import statement in a __init__.py file.\n- The code is standard for Python package initialization.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity is present.\n- The import is static and straightforward, with no data flows or untrusted input handling.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms benign nature with high confidence (1).\n- No anomalies or malware.\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Score appropriateness:** The risk score of 0 is justified; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar assessment; confirms benign with confidence 1.\n- No anomalies or malware.\n- **Score appropriateness:** Risk score 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still indicates benign.\n- Notes that the import could execute code in helper.py but sees no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk is 0.1, which seems conservative given the simplicity.\n- **Challenge:** Since the code is just an import statement, unless helper.py contains malicious code, the risk remains minimal.\n- **Score adjustment:** The securityRisk of 0.1 is perhaps slightly high; given the minimal code, a 0 or 0.1 is acceptable, but more justified as 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Fully consistent with others.\n- Confident score 1.\n- No issues detected.\n- **Score appropriateness:** Zero risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion; confident 1.\n- No anomalies or malware.\n- **Score appropriateness:** Zero risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only minor point is the securityRisk of 0.1 in report 3, which might be slightly overcautious for such a simple import statement.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified by the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the import is from a local module, unless helper.py contains malicious code, this is safe.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code snippet is clearly benign. No further action needed.",
