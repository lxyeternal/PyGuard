  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Reports 1, 2, 4, 5**:\n   - All describe the code as a straightforward import statement (`from .helper import init_helper`) in a `__init__.py` file.\n   - They correctly identify that this is standard package initialization code with no embedded logic, no data flow, no suspicious patterns.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n   - Malware scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n2. **Report 3**:\n   - Slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to the note that the import could execute code in `helper.py`. While importing a module can execute code, this is standard behavior in Python and not inherently malicious.\n   - The report assigns a small security risk score of 0.1, which seems reasonable given the minimal potential for issues, but no actual malicious activity is indicated.\n   - Malware score remains at 0, which is correct since there's no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code snippets are all simple import statements in a package's `__init__.py`.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since the code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No changes needed; the scoring and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard package initialization.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns detected.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
