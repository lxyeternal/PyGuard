      "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and safe; any malicious activity depends on the implementation of 'init_helper', which is outside this scope. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. No obfuscation is present. The overall assessment indicates minimal risk based solely on this code."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior characteristic of malware: remote payload download, execution without validation, and suspicious recursive calls. The logical flaw in recursion suggests obfuscation or poor coding practices, but the malicious intent remains clear. The assigned scores of 0.95 for malware and risk are justified, with an obfuscation score of 0.6 reflecting some complexity or obfuscation tactics. Overall, this code should be considered highly malicious and dangerous."
