  "purpose": "Utility functions and helpers for a Flask web application, including response handling, URL generation, flashing messages, and request context management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'FLASK_ENV', 'FLASK_DEBUG', 'FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV'), request context, session data, request environment, function parameters (paths, URLs, response configs).",
  "sinks": "Response objects (via make_response, send_file, redirect), environment variables (read for config), session data (flash messages), request environment (in send_file and send_from_directory).",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Configuration functions; Request environment/session data -> Response functions (send_file, make_response, redirect); Input parameters -> URL and file serving functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of warnings for deprecated env vars, but no malicious logic. Functions are standard Flask helpers with no suspicious code flow or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises typical Flask utility functions for response management, URL building, flashing messages, and file handling. It uses environment variables to determine configuration, with warnings about deprecated usage, which is standard practice. The functions for sending files and directory serving use Werkzeug's safe methods, and the request context management functions are standard. No external or untrusted data is directly used in a way that introduces security risks. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The code does not include malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Overall, it appears to be standard, safe Flask helper code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of Flask utility functions intended for web response handling, URL generation, message flashing, and safe file serving. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks beyond typical deprecated environment variable warnings. It is safe and aligned with common Flask practices.",
