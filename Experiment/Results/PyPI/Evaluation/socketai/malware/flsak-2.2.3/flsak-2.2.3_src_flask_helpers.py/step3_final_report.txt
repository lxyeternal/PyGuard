{
  "purpose": "Provides Flask utility functions for environment configuration, response handling, URL generation, request context management, file serving, and session flashing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, request globals, session data, Flask and Werkzeug APIs",
  "sinks": "Response objects, environment variables, session modifications, warnings, errors",
  "flows": "Environment variables and request/session data are read; responses are generated; session is modified during flashing; environment variables are accessed before response creation",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated environment variables with warnings; appending to session list for flashing messages",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Flask helper functions, employing safe APIs and practices. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Use of warnings for deprecated environment variables is typical, and session handling aligns with Flask conventions. No external network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and follow best practices, with no suspicious patterns or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured Flask utility functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate, primarily reflecting minor deprecation warnings that do not pose security concerns.",
