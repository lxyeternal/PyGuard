{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions and classes for Flask web applications, including response handling, URL generation, request context management, flashing messages, file sending, and environment variable access.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (os.environ), request context (_cv_request), session data (session), and request environment (request.environ).",
  "sinks": "Uses Flask's response system (current_app.response_class), werkzeug.utils functions (send_file, send_from_directory, redirect, abort), and external modules. Writes to session (_flashes).",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or session data flows into response creation or flash message storage. Request context (_cv_request) is used to maintain state across streamed responses. Environment variables influence environment detection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of deprecated warnings is benign. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Flask utility functions for handling responses, URL building, environment detection, session flashing, file sending, and request context management. All input sources are either environment variables or session/request data, with no untrusted or malicious data flows. Sinks involve standard Flask and Werkzeug response handling without malicious actions. The code employs proper abstractions and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility module for Flask applications without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical Flask utility module implementing response and request handling, with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs common, safe functions consistent with Flask best practices.",
