  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask CLI utility with controlled dynamic features. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The potential risks are minimal and typical for such tools, primarily related to misuse if inputs are malicious, but no active malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context."
