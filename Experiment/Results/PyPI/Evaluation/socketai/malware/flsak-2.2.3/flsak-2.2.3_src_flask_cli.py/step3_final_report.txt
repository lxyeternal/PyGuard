{
  "purpose": "The code provides CLI utilities for Flask application management, including dynamic app discovery, environment variable loading, SSL configuration, and shell execution, primarily for development purposes.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variables, module attributes, and function calls for app loading and configuration.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic module imports, function invocations, execution of code in the shell, environment file loading, and SSL context setup.",
  "flows": "Sources such as command-line options and environment variables lead to dynamic imports and function calls, which may execute arbitrary code or load configurations; environment files influence environment variables; SSL setup involves file paths or import strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ast.literal_eval' for parsing arguments and dynamic import mechanisms are standard but could be misused if inputs are malicious; execution of arbitrary code in the shell is typical for CLI tools but warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code employs controlled dynamic imports, safe literal evaluation, and standard Flask CLI patterns. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'ast.literal_eval' and explicit validation reduces risk. The dynamic features are typical for development tools and are well-encapsulated. The environment loading functions check for proper files and handle missing dependencies gracefully. SSL configuration includes validation for input types, and the overall structure is transparent and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask CLI utility with controlled dynamic features. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The potential risks are minimal and typical for such tools, primarily related to misuse if inputs are malicious, but no active malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context.",
