  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for the Python package 'flsak' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data in the form of dependency requirements and package metadata from the setup() function and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are hardcoded and static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated patterns; dependency specifications include version constraints, but nothing suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, specifying dependencies and extras. It contains no dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling. The dependency list includes common packages with version constraints. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a safe and standard use of setuptools for package distribution.",
