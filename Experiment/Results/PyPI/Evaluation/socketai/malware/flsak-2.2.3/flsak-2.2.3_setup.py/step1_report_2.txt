  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'flsak', including dependencies and optional extras.",
  "sources": "The code reads static dependency specifications and metadata within the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data; only static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependency requirements are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to specify package metadata and dependencies. Dependencies are statically listed with version constraints. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts. No code execution, input handling, or network operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only declares dependencies and optional extras for a Python package.",
