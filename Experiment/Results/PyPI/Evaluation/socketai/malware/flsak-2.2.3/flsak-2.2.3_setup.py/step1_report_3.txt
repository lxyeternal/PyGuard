{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'flsak', specifying dependencies and optional extras.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and dependencies, primarily from the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks are present; the code does not perform network operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The setup() function specifies dependencies that are loaded during package installation but do not involve untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The dependencies are standard, well-known packages.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies, with no user input processing or dynamic code execution. The dependencies are specified with version constraints, including environment-based conditions. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, and there are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
