  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for a Python project, specifying dependencies and extras.",
  "sources": "The code reads dependency specifications and environment information for package installation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The source of dependency requirements is processed by setuptools for installation; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors; setup configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup and defines package metadata and dependencies, including conditional dependencies based on Python version. There are no code injections, network activities, or obfuscated components. Usage of environment variables or external inputs is absent. The code strictly manages dependency specification, which is typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies dependencies and extras for a Python package. No anomalies, malware, or security issues detected.",
