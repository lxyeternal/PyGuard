{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, specifying dependencies and optional extras without dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static dependency declarations in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static code with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, declarative setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. Dependencies are standard packages with reasonable version constraints. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The analysis is thorough and accurate, with no logical errors or unwarranted assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe dependency configuration.",
