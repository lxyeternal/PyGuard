  "purpose": "This code provides error handling, request patching, and template loading explanations for a Flask web application.",
  "sources": "Request data (request.files, request.form), loader objects, app configuration, request URL and blueprint info.",
  "sinks": "Error messages (DebugFilesKeyError, FormDataRoutingRedirect), logger info output, patched request.files.__getitem__.",
  "flows": "Request data (input) to error handling and info logs; loader info to logs; request URL and blueprint data to error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code only enhances error reporting and debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes, a patch function for request.files to improve error messages, functions to dump loader info, and a debugging helper for template loading attempts. It does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The error handling and patching mechanisms are standard for web development and debugging. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to improve developer visibility into request and template loading issues without performing any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Flask debugging and error handling module with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. It enhances error messages and request inspection, but does not include any malicious or harmful behaviors.",
