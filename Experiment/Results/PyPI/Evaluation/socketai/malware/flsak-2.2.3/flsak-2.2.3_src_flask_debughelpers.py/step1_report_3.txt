  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and custom exception classes for handling request errors, debugging, and template loading in a Flask web application.",
  "sources": "Request input data via request.form and request.files, and request context via request_ctx.",
  "sinks": "Raising custom exceptions and modifying request.files.__class__ to provide enhanced error messages.",
  "flows": "Input data from request.form and request.files can trigger exceptions like DebugFilesKeyError, which then get raised; request_ctx provides request data used in debugging functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically patches request.files.__class__ to enhance error reporting; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activities are present; code appears to be standard Flask debugging and error handling routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom error classes for handling specific request errors and enhances Flask's request handling for debugging purposes. It patches request.files.__getitem__ to provide detailed error messages when files are missing, which is a standard debugging feature. The functions for dumping loader info and explaining template loading attempts are used for debugging template loading issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. All data handling appears to be for error reporting and debugging within a Flask web app environment. No external network activity, cryptographic operations, or credential harvesting code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of debugging and error handling utilities for a Flask app, with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply enhances error messages and logging for development purposes.",
