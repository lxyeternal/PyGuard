The URL generation relies solely on internal, trusted data, and the structure is straightforward. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, primarily theoretical if release data were compromised, which is unlikely. Overall, the reports are accurate, and the code is safe."

The potential risks are minimal and typical for such tools, primarily related to misuse if inputs are malicious, but no active malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context."

The only security consideration is ensuring filename validation in resource-serving functions if filenames are derived from untrusted sources. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
