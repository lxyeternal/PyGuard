  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Flask Blueprint implementation, managing registration of routes, handlers, and templates. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is typical Flask code, with no signs of malicious intent. The low risk score (0.2) aligns with this. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role in managing Flask blueprints with standard patterns. No malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk score is 0.2.\n- **Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning is consistent. The code is standard, with no suspicious behavior. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. No changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's management of Flask blueprints, with detailed attention to registration and internal state handling. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's purpose. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the standard nature of the code, registration mechanisms, and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The code is a typical Flask blueprint management class, with no signs of malicious intent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical Flask blueprint class, managing registration of routes, error handlers, and template functions. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The slightly lower risk score (0.1) is justified given the standard nature of the code. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is correct. The code is clear, standard Python/Flask code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low (0.1-0.2). Given the code's purpose and behavior, these are appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of Flask's blueprint system.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n- The use of warnings for deprecated features is standard practice, not malicious.\n- No external network activity or data leakage detected.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard Flask blueprint code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured Flask blueprint implementation with no malicious or security concerns.",
