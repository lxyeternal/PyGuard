  "purpose": "The code provides custom testing utilities for Flask applications, including environment builders, test clients, and CLI runners, primarily used for testing and development purposes.",
  "sources": "Configuration data, environment variables, request data, session data, and CLI input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Request handling, session management, JSON serialization, and CLI command execution within testing contexts.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables, request parameters, and session data flow through request construction, session handling, and CLI invocation, without external network or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard Flask testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines testing utilities that manage request environments, sessions, and CLI commands for Flask applications. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The environment setup, request simulation, and session handling are implemented securely and transparently. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected. The code's purpose is solely for testing, which inherently carries low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of testing utilities for Flask applications. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
