  "purpose": "Type annotations and type alias definitions for a web framework, primarily related to request and response handling in Flask/werkzeug.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, imports, and type alias declarations, especially from typing module and werkzeug types.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified as sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are present; the code solely defines types and type variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and conditionally imports types for type checking, then defines various type aliases and type variables for HTTP response, headers, route functions, and Flask-like callbacks. The code is purely declarative, serving as type hints for static analysis and IDE support. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime operations that could be malicious. All definitions are standard and expected for a web framework's typing layer. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of type annotations for a web framework and contains no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely declarative and used for static type checking purposes. No malware, security threats, or anomalies are identified.",
