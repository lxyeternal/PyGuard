  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely for static type annotations related to Flask/Werkzeug.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is standard for type hinting support, with conditional imports for type checking.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code defines type aliases, union types, and type variables to facilitate static analysis.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or I/O operations are involved.\n- The purpose is purely for development-time type safety and clarity.\n\n**Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the absence of runtime or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious code constructs are identified.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation module for Flask/Werkzeug.\n- It poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, purely declarative nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard static type annotation module with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. The reported scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
