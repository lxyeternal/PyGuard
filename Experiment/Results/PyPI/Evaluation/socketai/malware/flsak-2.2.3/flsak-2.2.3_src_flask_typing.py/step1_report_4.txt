{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and type aliases for Flask/werkzeug web application components to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, imports modules, and defines type aliases and variables related to web request/response handling.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only defines types and imports, which do not process untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow occurs; the code is purely type definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features; the code is standard for type hinting and type safety in a web framework context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'typing' and conditionally imports type hints for type checking only, defining various type aliases for response values, headers, and callback functions related to web request handling in Flask or Werkzeug. There are no runtime data reads, external calls, or data processing that could pose security risks. The code appears to be purely for type safety and code clarity, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard type annotation definitions for Flask/Werkzeug and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and solely aimed at improving code correctness through type hints.",
