  "purpose": "Type annotations and aliases for Flask/Werkzeug components to facilitate static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports for type checking, type alias definitions, and type variables for Flask/Werkzeug classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process data at runtime or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "None; all definitions are static type hints with no data flow at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, purely declarative, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases, union types, and conditional imports for static type checking in Flask/Werkzeug projects. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign utility for type hints, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of type annotations for Flask/Werkzeug, posing no security threat or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
