  "purpose": "Define type annotations and type aliases for Flask/Werkzeug HTTP request and response handling.",
  "sources": "Type annotations are used throughout the code to specify expected input and output types, especially for functions related to HTTP responses, headers, and application callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Type annotations themselves are not sinks; however, if the code is used to type-check untrusted user input or dynamically generated data, it could influence security. No explicit data sinks like network connections or file operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code specifies type flows for HTTP response objects, headers, and callback functions but does not implement any actual data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code constructs. The code is purely for static type annotations and contains no executable or runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "This module consists solely of type alias definitions, type variables, and union types for Flask or Werkzeug HTTP request/response components. It imports standard typing modules and conditionally imports some types for type-checking purposes. No input reading, data processing, or output generation occurs. The code appears to serve as a type hinting utility for other Flask/Werkzeug-based modules or applications. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. It does not interact with external systems, handle data, or perform any actions beyond defining types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable type annotation module designed to aid static type checking in Flask/Werkzeug projects. It shows no malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is purely for type hinting and does not process or handle untrusted data at runtime.",
