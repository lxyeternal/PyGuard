{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and type aliases for a web framework, defining expected input and output types for request handlers and middleware.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and variable declarations; no runtime data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially unsafe actions; purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is only defining types and aliases without executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; standard type hinting patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for web request handling, middleware, and callback functions. It uses type variables, unions, and optional types to specify various possible data formats. The code includes conditional imports for type checking only, and the rest are type alias definitions. There is no data input, network communication, file manipulation, or other runtime logic that could be exploited or malicious. The code appears to be a standard static type declaration for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static type annotation definitions intended for type checking and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It follows common patterns for type hinting in Python web frameworks and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
