  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The URL generation relies solely on internal, trusted data, and the structure is straightforward. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, primarily theoretical if release data were compromised, which is unlikely. Overall, the reports are accurate, and the code is safe."
