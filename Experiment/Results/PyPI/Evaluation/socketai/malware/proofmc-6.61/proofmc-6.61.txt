      "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during package setup, strongly indicating malicious activity. The behavior suggests potential remote code execution, payload delivery, or backdoor installation. The scores assigned in the reports are justified; the malware likelihood is high, obfuscation is significant, and security risk is elevated. This package should be flagged for further review and not trusted for distribution."
