{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive user data related to Exodus wallet files and configurations, compresses them into a zip archive, and exfiltrates the data via Telegram messaging service.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, file existence checks, and HTTP requests to fetch IP address and country code.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the HTTP POST request to Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and files, which transmits potentially sensitive user data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local file paths and environment variables into a zip archive; then, the archive and messages containing user data are sent over the network to Telegram, including IP address and geolocation info.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID are present; the code captures and compresses sensitive wallet data and configuration files, then exfiltrates them without user consent. Use of requests to external IP geolocation service and IP address retrieval indicate data harvesting activities. The code contains no user interaction or indication of user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current user's username and environment variables to construct file paths to potentially sensitive Exodus wallet files and configuration data. If such files exist, it compresses them into a zip archive. It then gathers the external IP address and country code via HTTP requests, constructs a message with geolocation and a flag emoji, and sends this data along with the zip archive to a Telegram bot using a hardcoded token. The use of hardcoded credentials, the collection of sensitive wallet files, and exfiltration over Telegram strongly suggest malicious intent consistent with data theft or espionage activities. The code exhibits no obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. It operates silently without user notification or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive user wallet files and configuration data to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot, indicating malicious intent. The presence of hardcoded credentials, collection of sensitive files, and network exfiltration all confirm a high security risk. It should be considered malicious malware for data theft and should be blocked and investigated further.",
