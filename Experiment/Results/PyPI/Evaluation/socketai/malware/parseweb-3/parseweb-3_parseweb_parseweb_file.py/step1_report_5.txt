  "purpose": "The code collects sensitive user data related to Exodus wallet files and configuration, compresses them, and then transmits this data via a Telegram bot, effectively acting as a data exfiltration tool.",
  "sources": [
    "getpass.getuser() - retrieves the current username",
    "os.getenv() - retrieves environment variables for directories",
    "requests.get() - retrieves external IP address and country code",
    "file existence checks and file path constructions"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "requests.post() - sends a message and a document (zip file) via Telegram API"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Collects user and environment data → zips sensitive files if present → sends a message with IP and country info + flag → uploads zip file to Telegram"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID",
    "Collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive wallet files and configuration files",
    "Use of requests to external IP and geolocation services for IP info",
    "No validation or sanitization of data before sending",
    "Exfiltration occurs unconditionally if files exist"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code begins by retrieving the current username and environment paths. It defines several file paths related to Exodus wallet data. If certain files or directories exist, it creates a ZIP archive and attempts to include various sensitive wallet files and config files, handling exceptions silently. It then constructs a message containing user info, including external IP address and country code, and embeds a country flag. The code finally posts this message and the ZIP file to a Telegram bot using a hardcoded token and chat ID, and cleans up by deleting the ZIP archive. The hardcoded token and the collection/exfiltration of sensitive wallet data suggest malicious intent, primarily aimed at unauthorized data theft. The code does not perform any validation or checks to ensure legitimate functionality, indicating it is likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This script acts as a malware component designed to covertly collect Exodus wallet files and user info, then exfiltrate the data via a Telegram bot. The use of hardcoded credentials, silent exception handling, and direct exfiltration strongly indicate malicious behavior with high security risk.",
