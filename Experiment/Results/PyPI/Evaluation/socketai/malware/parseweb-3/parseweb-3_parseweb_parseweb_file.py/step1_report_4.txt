{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect and archive specific user data related to the Exodus wallet application and transmit it via Telegram.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser() for username, environment variables (LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), file existence checks, requests to external IP API, reading local files (exodus.conf.json, wallet files, passphrase, seed, storage, twofactor), and reading files for archiving.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages and documents via Telegram API, reading user-specific files, and making network requests to IP and country code APIs.",
  "flows": "Collects user data and wallet files, zips relevant files if they exist, constructs a message including IP and country info, and sends this data as a document and message to a Telegram chat.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of potentially sensitive files (wallet data, passphrases, seeds), concatenation of user data into messages, and transmission of this data over the internet without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive wallet and configuration files related to Exodus, a cryptocurrency wallet, and zips these files if they exist. It constructs a message containing the user's IP address, country code, and a customized message with a flag emoji. The script then uploads the zip archive and message to a specified Telegram bot, effectively exfiltrating user data. The presence of hardcoded tokens and the collection of wallet files indicate malicious intent. The code also makes network requests to IP geolocation services, further supporting its data exfiltration purpose. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present, and the flow is straightforward but malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as data exfiltration malware targeting Exodus wallet users, collecting sensitive files, and transmitting them via Telegram. The hardcoded credentials and collection of wallet data without user consent confirm malicious behavior with high confidence.",
