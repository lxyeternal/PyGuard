{
  "purpose": "The code collects Exodus wallet files and configuration data, compresses them into a zip archive, and exfiltrates the data via Telegram, including IP and geolocation info, without user consent.",
  "sources": "Wallet files, configuration files, environment variables, external IP and geolocation services.",
  "sinks": "Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents.",
  "flows": "Data from local files and environment variables → zipped archive → IP/geolocation info → Telegram message and document upload.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID; collection of sensitive files without user notification; silent operation; exception handling suppressing errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs malicious data theft by collecting sensitive wallet and configuration files, compressing them, and exfiltrating via Telegram with hardcoded credentials. It also retrieves IP and geolocation info to embed in the message. The code operates silently, with no user consent, and deletes the zip after sending to cover tracks. The presence of hardcoded credentials and targeted wallet files strongly indicates malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and uses standard libraries. The exfiltration process is consistent with malware behavior, and the network requests to external IP services are typical for malicious actors gathering contextual info. Exception handling is silent, preventing crashes but also hiding errors. Overall, the activity is clearly malicious, designed for stealthy exfiltration of sensitive data, with high potential for harm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a data-stealing malware targeting Exodus wallet files. It exfiltrates sensitive data via Telegram using hardcoded credentials, retrieves IP/geolocation info, and operates silently without user consent. The scores should reflect high maliciousness and security risk.",
