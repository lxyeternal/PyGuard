{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect sensitive information related to Exodus cryptocurrency wallet files and transmit them via a Telegram bot, potentially for malicious exfiltration of user data.",
  "sources": "Gets username via getpass.getuser(); reads environment variables for paths; checks for existence of specific wallet and configuration files; reads local network IP address via HTTP request; opens zip file for writing; reads files from disk (info, passphrase, seed, storage, 2FA data, config, wallet info, wallet files); fetches external IP address and country code via requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends a message and a file (zip containing sensitive data) to a Telegram bot using requests.post; deletes zip file afterward.",
  "flows": "Collects user data and sensitive wallet files -> Compresses them into a zip archive -> Retrieves external IP and country info -> Sends message and files via Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which can be used maliciously; collection and exfiltration of sensitive wallet files and secrets; the code constructs a zip archive with potentially sensitive files without user consent; potential use of environment variables for paths; obfuscated emoji replacement for country flag; no user prompts or permissions check; unprotected exfiltration process.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers user-specific data, including wallet and configuration files from specific directories, and creates a zip archive. It retrieves external IP and country code information, then compiles a message with this data and sends both the message and the zip file to a hardcoded Telegram bot. The use of hardcoded credentials and the collection of sensitive wallet files indicate malicious intent, aimed at data exfiltration without user consent. The code operates silently in the background, with no evident user notification or permission handling. Overall, it exhibits classic characteristics of a data theft malware targeting cryptocurrency wallet information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive Exodus wallet files and related data, then exfiltrate them via a Telegram bot, indicating malicious behavior. The hardcoded credentials and lack of user consent strongly suggest malicious intent, and the script's overall purpose appears to be stealing user data. This constitutes a security risk and should be flagged for removal and further review.",
