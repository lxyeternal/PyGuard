  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Collects Exodus wallet data, compresses, exfiltrates via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, file checks, HTTP requests for IP/geolocation.\n- **Sinks:** Sends message and document via Telegram API.\n- **Flow:** Data from local files → zip archive → IP/geolocation info → send to Telegram.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded Telegram token and chat ID; collection of sensitive files without user consent; network exfiltration.\n- **Analysis:** Clear data theft behavior, exfiltration of sensitive wallet data, high confidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 1, Security Risk 1, Obfuscated 0 (no obfuscation).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar collection and exfiltration of Exodus wallet data via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** Wallet files, environment variables, IP info.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram message and file upload.\n- **Flow:** Collect → zip → IP info → send via Telegram.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials, collection of sensitive data without consent, automatic deletion.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern of data exfiltration, high malicious likelihood.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.9, Security Risk 0.9, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Collects and transmits Exodus wallet data via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** User environment, wallet files, IP info.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram message and document.\n- **Flow:** Gather data → zip → IP info → send.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials, no user notification, collection of sensitive files.\n- **Analysis:** Clearly malicious, designed for data theft.\n- **Scores:** Malware 1, Security Risk 1, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar data exfiltration of Exodus wallet info via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** User environment, wallet files, IP info.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram API.\n- **Flow:** Collect → zip → IP info → send.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials, no user consent, silent operation.\n- **Analysis:** Malicious exfiltration, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware 1, Security Risk 1, Obfuscated 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Collects and exfiltrates Exodus wallet data via Telegram.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, wallet files, IP info.\n- **Sinks:** Telegram message and file upload.\n- **Flow:** Collect → zip → IP info → send.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials, no validation, silent exfiltration.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with malware behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 1, Security Risk 1, Obfuscated 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports describe code that **collects sensitive wallet files and configuration data**, **gathers IP/geolocation info**, and **exfiltrates this data via Telegram**.\n- **Hardcoded Telegram credentials** are present in all reports.\n- **No user consent or notification** is observed.\n- The code operates silently, with exception handling that suppresses errors.\n- The purpose is clearly malicious: **unauthorized data theft** of cryptocurrency wallet data.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should be **1** for all reports, as they all describe malicious exfiltration.\n- The **security risk** should also be **1**, given the high potential for data theft.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0**, as no obfuscation techniques are evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the consistency and the clear malicious intent, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 1\n\nThe code is unequivocally malicious, designed for stealthy exfiltration of sensitive wallet data, and should be flagged accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The original reports' scores are mostly aligned with this assessment, but some slightly undervalue the malware score (e.g., 0.9). I recommend setting the malware score to **1** for clarity and to reflect the high confidence in malicious intent.",
