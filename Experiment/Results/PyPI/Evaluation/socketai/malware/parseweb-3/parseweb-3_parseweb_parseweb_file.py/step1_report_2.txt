{
  "purpose": "The script appears to collect sensitive user data related to Exodus wallet files and send this data via a Telegram bot, possibly for malicious intent such as theft or unauthorized access.",
  "sources": "Get user environment variables, read various wallet-related files (exodus.conf.json, seed, passphrase, wallet info, etc.), access IP address via external request, check for file existence, and read wallet files for packaging.",
  "sinks": "Sending a message and document through Telegram API, uploading wallet files, and potentially removing zip archive afterward.",
  "flows": "Reads user data and wallet files → packages data into zip → constructs message with IP and country info → sends message and files to Telegram → deletes zip archive.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, collection of wallet and sensitive files without user consent, exfiltration of data over the internet, and automatic deletion of zip archive after exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive wallet data from specific directories, packaging multiple wallet-related files into a zip archive. It retrieves the user's IP address and country code, then constructs a message including this information along with a wallet notification. The script then exfiltrates this data by sending a message and the zip file via Telegram API, using hardcoded credentials. The deletion of the archive afterward suggests an intent to cover tracks. The presence of hardcoded tokens, the exfiltration of sensitive wallet data, and the lack of user consent or notification are indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates sensitive wallet data and user IP information to an external Telegram account without user consent, which strongly suggests malicious intent. It acts as a potential wallet stealer or info stealer script with high malicious behavior likelihood.",
