  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'parseweb' that defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, reading 'README.md' file for long description, importing 'setuptools' modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Imports from 'setuptools', reads 'README.md' content, passes data to 'setup()' function, installs dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script structure, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup configuration using setuptools. It reads package info and dependencies, including the README file for description. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution. All operations are static and related to package metadata. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
