  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'parseweb', defining metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no network or data leaks initiated by the script.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file during setup, then passing data to setup() without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without validation or sanitization; however, this is typical for setup scripts and not malicious. No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It loads package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. The only notable operation is reading 'README.md' for the long description, which is common practice. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No obfuscated code, malware patterns, or security concerns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup configuration with no malicious intent. It follows standard conventions and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
