  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'parseweb' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md', and gathers packages via find_packages()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processed at runtime beyond package metadata and dependencies",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; setup configuration is static",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; uses standard setup practices",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads 'README.md' for long description and uses find_packages() to discover packages. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution present. The dependencies are standard ('requests', 'colorama') with no signs of malicious code. The URL points to a GitHub repository, but no code execution or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks detected.",
