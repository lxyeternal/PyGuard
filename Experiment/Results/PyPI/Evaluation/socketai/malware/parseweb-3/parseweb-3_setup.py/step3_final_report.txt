  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file, imports 'setuptools' for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.md' during setup; no external data flows or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; URL points to unrelated repository but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static configuration, no dynamic or malicious behavior. The URL discrepancy is likely a misconfiguration, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data processing are present. The minimal risk arises from reading a file without validation, which is standard in setup scripts and not exploitable in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard package configuration. The minor URL mismatch does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score can be set at 0, reflecting no significant threat.",
