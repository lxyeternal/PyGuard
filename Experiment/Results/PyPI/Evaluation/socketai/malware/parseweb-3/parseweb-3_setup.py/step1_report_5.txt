  "purpose": "Defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'parseweb' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input from the 'README.md' file via open('README.md').read()",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' file during long_description assignment; no other data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling, but this is typical for setup scripts and not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to configure the package. It reads the long description from a markdown file. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling is present. The code is standard for Python package setup and does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
