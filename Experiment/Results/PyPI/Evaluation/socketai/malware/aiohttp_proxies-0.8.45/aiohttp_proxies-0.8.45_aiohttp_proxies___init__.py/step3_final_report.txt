  "purpose": "Module initialization for the aiohttp-socks package, defining metadata and exposing public API symbols.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from python_socks and local modules, package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable definitions without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for a Python package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py file that sets package metadata and imports symbols for public API exposure. It contains only static import statements and variable definitions, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is purely organizational, serving as an API interface. All signals indicate benign, standard code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
