{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata and imports various classes and functions related to proxy handling and SOCKS proxy support for the 'aiohttp-socks' package.",
  "sources": "No input sources; imports are static and predefined within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; code mainly establishes imports and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code only contains standard import statements and module attribute definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata (__title__, __version__) and imports various classes and functions from the 'python_socks' package, local modules, and deprecated utilities. All imports are static and explicitly defined. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or data processing that could introduce security risks or malicious behavior. The code structure is typical for a Python module's __init__.py file, used to define the public API and organize imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module initialization file with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security issues. It primarily manages imports and package metadata, with no untrusted data sources or sinks.",
