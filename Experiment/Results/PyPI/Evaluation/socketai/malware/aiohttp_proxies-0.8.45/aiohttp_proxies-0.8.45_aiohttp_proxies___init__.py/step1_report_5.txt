{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API and imports for the 'aiohttp-socks' library, which provides SOCKS proxy support for aiohttp.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'python_socks', local modules (.connector, .utils, ._deprecated). No user input or external data sources are read directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing or handling of external input shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is a straightforward module import/export setup.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines module-level variables (__title__, __version__) and imports symbols from external modules. It specifies the public API via __all__ without executing any logic, data processing, or network operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file, focusing on setup and exports.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module initialization file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It primarily manages imports and public API exposure for the 'aiohttp-socks' package.",
