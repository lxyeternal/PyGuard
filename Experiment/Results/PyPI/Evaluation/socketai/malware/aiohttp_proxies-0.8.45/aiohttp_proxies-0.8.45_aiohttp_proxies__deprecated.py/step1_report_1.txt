{
  "purpose": "Define a SOCKS proxy connector class that manages proxy settings, warnings about deprecation, and error handling for proxy operations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the constructor arguments, particularly 'socks_ver' and '**kwargs', as well as the 'from_url' class method.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the superclass 'ProxyConnector' methods 'super().__init__' and 'super().from_url', which may process or establish proxy connections based on input data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters or 'from_url' input through class methods into superclass methods which handle connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior; the code primarily issues a deprecation warning and initializes proxy configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines proxy version constants, a warning function for deprecated usage, and a class 'SocksConnector' that extends 'ProxyConnector'. The class issues a deprecation warning whenever instantiated or called via 'from_url', guiding users towards the new 'ProxyConnector'. The class constructor handles optional 'proxy_type' arguments or defaults to a SOCKS version. The code imports specific proxy-related exceptions but does not utilize them directly; instead, it relies on the superclass for core functionality. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The overall structure suggests standard deprecation handling and proxy setup logic without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward deprecation wrapper around an existing proxy connector class, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It primarily issues warnings and forwards parameters to the superclass. The code appears safe and purposeful, with no indication of malware or malicious behavior.",
