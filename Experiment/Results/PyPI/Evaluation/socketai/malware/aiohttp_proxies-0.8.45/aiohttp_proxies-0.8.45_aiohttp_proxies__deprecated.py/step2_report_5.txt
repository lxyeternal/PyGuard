  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines SOCKS version constants.\n- Implements a deprecated `SocksConnector` class that wraps `ProxyConnector`.\n- Issues deprecation warnings upon instantiation and `from_url` calls.\n- Passes parameters to the superclass for actual proxy handling.\n- Imports relevant exceptions but does not directly use them.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper with deprecation notices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a deprecation wrapper; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The use of warnings is standard for deprecation notices.\n- The actual proxy logic is delegated to the superclass, which is not part of this code snippet.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code's design is typical for deprecation handling.\n- The only minor point is that imported exceptions are not used directly, but this is not a security concern.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the analysis. No malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal security risk. Since the code is a wrapper issuing warnings, this seems appropriate.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No evidence suggests any risk higher than 0.2.\n- The deprecation warnings do not introduce security issues; they are standard practice.\n- The delegation to the superclass means any actual security concerns depend on the superclass implementation, which is outside this code snippet.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is safe, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports, perhaps slightly conservative)\n\nThe code is a benign, standard deprecation wrapper for a proxy connector class, with no signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware.\n- The deprecation warnings are appropriate and standard.\n- The overall security risk is minimal.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
