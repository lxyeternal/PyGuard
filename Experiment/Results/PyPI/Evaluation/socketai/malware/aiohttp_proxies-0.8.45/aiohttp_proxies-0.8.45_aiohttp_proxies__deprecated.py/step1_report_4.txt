{
  "purpose": "Defines a SocksConnector class for handling SOCKS proxy connections, including deprecation warning and initialization logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, python_socks, and local connector module; class and function definitions; usage of class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "Superclass constructor calls and method calls that initialize network proxy connections.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation calls the constructor, which calls the superclass constructor, and method calls that create proxy connection objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code includes a deprecation warning for an outdated class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for SOCKS proxy handling, including a deprecated warning. It properly uses class inheritance and conditional logic to set proxy types. No data is read from or written to untrusted sources; no network or system calls are made directly here. The only external action is issuing a deprecation warning, which is benign. The code appears to be a straightforward proxy connector utility without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a proxy connector with deprecation warnings. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or malicious code. It functions as part of a proxy management library and does not perform any harmful actions.",
