  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward deprecation wrapper around a proxy connector class.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code issues deprecation warnings, forwards parameters, and relies on external libraries for core functionality.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code's purpose is to guide users from an old class to a new one, which is a common and benign practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code matches the description: it defines constants, issues warnings, and delegates core functionality to the superclass.\n- No anomalies or security risks are evident.\n- The use of warnings.warn for deprecation is standard.\n- No evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No technical errors or flaws are apparent.\n- The logic appears correct, and the code's behavior aligns with its purpose.\n- The only minor note is that the imported exceptions (`ProxyError`, `ProxyConnectionError`) are not used directly within this snippet, but this is not an error—perhaps they are intended for external handling or future use.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's benign nature, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The low security risk scores are justified because the code only issues warnings and delegates to external libraries.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is justified; no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, mostly due to deprecation warnings and delegation, which are standard practices.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of a deprecated proxy connector wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues present in the code.  \n- The reasoning and scores are reasonable.  \n- The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
