  "purpose": "Define a deprecated SocksConnector class for proxy connection handling, including warnings for deprecated usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements, warnings.warn calls, class initialization, and class method from_url.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn (potential information disclosure if misused), super().__init__, super().from_url.",
  "flows": "Initialization of SocksConnector may trigger warnings; usage of from_url method triggers warnings and delegates to superclass.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warnings indicating outdated code, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a SocksVer class for SOCKS version constants. It includes a function to warn users about deprecated classes. The SocksConnector class inherits from ProxyConnector, issues deprecation warnings on instantiation and method calls, and conditionally passes parameters to the superclass constructor. The code maps proxy error classes to local names. No input reading, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The code relies on external libraries for core functionality and only manages warnings about deprecation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for proxy configuration management with deprecation warnings; no malicious or suspicious activity identified. It appears standard and non-malicious.",
