{
  "purpose": "Provides a deprecated SOCKS proxy connector class that wraps around a general ProxyConnector, issuing warnings to guide users towards the newer ProxyConnector class.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) and the from_url class method, which receive parameters such as proxy type and URL; import statements for external libraries and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "super().__init__() and super().from_url() calls, which delegate to external code that may process untrusted data or URLs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (proxy type, URL) flow into the constructor and from_url method, then delegate to superclass methods that handle actual connection setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; deprecation warnings are standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for SOCKS versions and a class SocksConnector that inherits from ProxyConnector. It issues deprecation warnings when instantiated or used via from_url, then delegates core functionality to the superclass. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The imported exceptions are unused within this snippet but are standard for handling proxy errors. The delegation to external code is typical for such wrappers, and the warnings serve as routine deprecation notices. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign deprecation wrapper around a proxy connector class, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
