{
  "purpose": "This code defines a SocksConnector class for handling SOCKS proxy connections, including deprecated warnings and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from warnings, python_socks, and local connector module; class and function definitions; usage of class attributes and warnings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the use of super().from_url(), which could process untrusted URLs if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input URL passed to from_url method flows into super().from_url(), which processes the data. Warnings are issued during class initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. Use of warnings for deprecation is standard. No obfuscation or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines SOCKS version constants, issues deprecation warnings for SocksConnector, and properly initializes parent class with proxy type. It handles URL-based instantiation through from_url method. No suspicious or malicious activity detected; the code appears to be a straightforward proxy connector wrapper with deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a proxy connector with deprecation warnings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
