  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper around an existing proxy connector class (`ProxyConnector`), primarily issuing deprecation warnings for `SocksConnector`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`python_socks`, `warnings`) and delegates core functionality to the superclass.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The warnings are standard practice for deprecating old classes, not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured utility for managing SOCKS proxy configurations.\n\n**Scores in the Reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** consistently 0.\n- **Risk:** mostly around 0.1–0.2, indicating minimal security concern.\n- **Confidence:** high (0.9–1), indicating the reviewers are confident in their assessments.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n\n- The only potential \"sink\" is the `super().from_url()` method, which could process untrusted URLs. However, this is standard behavior for proxy configuration code and does not inherently imply malicious activity.\n- The deprecation warnings are benign and part of routine code maintenance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- No evidence of malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The code is a standard, deprecated wrapper with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The risk scores assigned (mostly 0.1–0.2) are appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n*Justification:* No malicious activity or payloads are detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n*Justification:* Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1**  \n*Justification:* Minimal security risk, mainly related to the handling of URLs in `from_url`, which is standard and controlled.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero. The deprecation warnings and the delegation to superclass methods are standard practices and do not pose security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Keep the risk score at approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal security concern.",
