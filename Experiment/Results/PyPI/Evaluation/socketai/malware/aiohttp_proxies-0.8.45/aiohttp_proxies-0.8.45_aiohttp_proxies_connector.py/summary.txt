  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of proxy connectors with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The potential security risk stems from external, untrusted proxy URLs, but this is standard and not an inherent flaw. The scores assigned are accurate and justified."
