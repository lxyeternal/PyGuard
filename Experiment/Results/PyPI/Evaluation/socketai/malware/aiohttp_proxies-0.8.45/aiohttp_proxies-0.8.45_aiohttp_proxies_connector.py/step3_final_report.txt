  "purpose": "Provides custom aiohttp connectors supporting single and chained SOCKS proxies, parsing proxy URLs, and establishing network connections via proxies.",
  "sources": "Proxy URL parsing functions, user-supplied proxy parameters, and network connection setup points.",
  "sinks": "Network connection establishment through proxies; no data leaks or malicious data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Proxy URL parsing -> Proxy object creation -> Connection via proxy -> Data transmission over network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; reliance on external proxy URLs without validation could be exploited but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of proxy connectors for aiohttp, supporting SOCKS proxies and chaining. It uses 'python_socks' for proxy management, parses proxy URLs, and establishes connections. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the use of untrusted proxy URLs, which could be exploited if malicious URLs are supplied, but this is typical for proxy configuration tools. The code's logic is correct, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of proxy connectors with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The potential security risk stems from external, untrusted proxy URLs, but this is standard and not an inherent flaw. The scores assigned are accurate and justified.",
