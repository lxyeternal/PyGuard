  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, standard, and free of malicious behavior, with a malware score of 0.0 and a security risk of 0.1.\n- **Validation:** The code matches the description—async functions for proxy connection setup, using 'python_socks' and asyncio, with proper parameter validation.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected; the reasoning is sound, and the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is deemed legitimate with no signs of malicious activity, malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Validation:** The description aligns with the code's purpose—proxy connection setup with validation and standard library use.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is characterized as a standard proxy connection utility, with no malicious behavior, malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Validation:** Consistent with the code's logic and structure.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here; the reasoning and scoring are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is considered legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity, malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Validation:** The analysis matches the code's straightforward proxy connection functions.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment and scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is again deemed a benign utility for proxy connections, with malware score 0, security risk 0.1.\n- **Validation:** The description aligns with the code's purpose and implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected; the scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** No, all reports agree the code is standard, legitimate, and free of malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports rate obfuscated as 0.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent given the code's nature.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern due to the code's functionality—proxy connection setup—which inherently involves network operations but no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher risk (0.2) in some reports is acceptable given the network context but should not be elevated further without evidence.\n- **Overall:** The code is a standard implementation of proxy connection functions with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (consistent with all reports and code analysis)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (reasonable, given the network operations involved)  \n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
