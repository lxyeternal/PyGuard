  "purpose": "Provides asynchronous functions to establish network connections via proxies, parsing proxy URLs and creating socket connections.",
  "sources": "parse_proxy_url function, user-provided proxy_url, host and port parameters",
  "sinks": "asyncio.open_connection and loop.create_connection with socket object, potential data flow through proxy",
  "flows": "proxy_url parsing -> proxy object creation -> socket connection -> data transmission via asyncio connection functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward use of external libraries",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for establishing proxy-based network connections asynchronously. It validates input parameters, parses proxy URLs, creates proxy objects, and connects sockets through the proxy, then opens asyncio connections. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The code relies on reputable libraries and performs typical network setup tasks. The provided reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, with low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2), high confidence levels, and consistent reasoning. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. The potential for misuse exists in proxy configurations but is inherent to proxy tools, not this implementation. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for establishing proxy connections asynchronously. All reports correctly identify it as non-malicious, with appropriate scoring. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
