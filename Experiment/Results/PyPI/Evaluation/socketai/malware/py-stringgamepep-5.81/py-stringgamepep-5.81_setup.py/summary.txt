  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious PowerShell commands executed silently during setup, triggered by a filesystem check. The embedded URL and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent. The high scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and reflect the significant threat posed by this code."
