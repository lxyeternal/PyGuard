{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a setup script for a Python package named 'py-hackednvidialib', including some malicious behavior intended to run hidden PowerShell commands during installation.",
  "sources": "The source of data includes the import statements, the existence check for 'tahg', and the encoded PowerShell command string within subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call executes a PowerShell command with hidden window style and encoded commands, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code checks for 'tahg' directory, then executes a hidden PowerShell command if absent, which may be used for malicious activities. The setup function defines package metadata but is overshadowed by the preceding malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of base64-encoded PowerShell command executed in a hidden window, with no apparent legitimate reason. The encoded command suggests obfuscation to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules but then executes a suspicious PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with encoded content, likely to perform malicious actions. The setup function appears typical but is overshadowed by the malicious subprocess execution. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present. The code's primary malicious activity is the silent execution of the encoded PowerShell script, which could perform harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing an obfuscated PowerShell command during package installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as data theft, system compromise, or other unauthorized actions. The rest of the setup code appears standard but is overshadowed by this malicious activity.",
