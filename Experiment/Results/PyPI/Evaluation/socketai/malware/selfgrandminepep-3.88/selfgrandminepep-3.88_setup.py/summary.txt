  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to the execution of an obfuscated, hidden PowerShell command, which could be used for remote code execution or payload delivery. The package setup appears legitimate but is likely a cover for malicious activity. The overall security risk is high, and the malware suspicion is justified."
