  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-probability malicious payload involving obfuscated PowerShell execution triggered during package setup. The embedded URL and silent, hidden execution are classic indicators of malicious activity, warranting classification as malicious with high severity. The scores (malware 0.9, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.9) are justified by the evidence."
