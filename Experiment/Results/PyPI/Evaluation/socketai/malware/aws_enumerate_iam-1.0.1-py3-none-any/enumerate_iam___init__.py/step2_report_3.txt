  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the variable `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, sinks, or external interactions.\n   - The code is standard practice in Python packaging for version declaration.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports unanimously state there are no anomalies, suspicious activities, or malicious behaviors.\n   - No obfuscation, code execution, network calls, or credential handling are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows; the analysis is sound.\n\n5. **Score Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - Obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; code is clear.\n   - Overall security risk is zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless version declaration.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores; they reflect the actual risk.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is safe, with no security concerns.",
