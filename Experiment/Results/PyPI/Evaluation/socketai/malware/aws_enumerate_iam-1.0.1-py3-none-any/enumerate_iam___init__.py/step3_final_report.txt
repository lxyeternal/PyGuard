  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output involved.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward assignment with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, a common practice in Python packaging. It contains no input/output, data flows, or external interactions. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and full confidence in this assessment. The code is minimal, clear, and standard, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
