  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code snippet with the claims made.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\n__version__ = '1.0.1'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code only assigns a string `'1.0.1'` to the variable `__version__`.\n- There are no input sources, data flows, sinks, or external calls.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity is present.\n- This is a standard practice for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n**All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.**\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5**:\n- **Purpose:** Accurately states that the code defines the version.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly notes absence of data input/output or flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All agree the code is a simple version assignment, benign, with no security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence), which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Malware:** 0, no malicious activity.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0, no security concern.\n\n**Scores:** All consistent and reasonable given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code snippet.**\n- **The reports are thorough and accurate.**\n- **No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security implications. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for more complex snippets, but in this case, the evidence is clear and confirms benign behavior.",
