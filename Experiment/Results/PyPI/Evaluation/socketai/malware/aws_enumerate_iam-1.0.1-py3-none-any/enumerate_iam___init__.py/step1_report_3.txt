  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module as '1.0.1'.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string assignment for __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual behavior; straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single variable assignment setting the __version__ attribute to '1.0.1'. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external calls. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It is a standard practice in Python packages to specify version info this way.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as a version identifier. No malicious intent, no security concerns detected.",
