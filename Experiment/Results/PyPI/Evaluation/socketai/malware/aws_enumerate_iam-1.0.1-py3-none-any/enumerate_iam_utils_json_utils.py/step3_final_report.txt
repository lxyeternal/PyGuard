  "purpose": "Utility functions for nested dictionary mapping, JSON serialization, encoding, and writing JSON data to files.",
  "sources": "Data passed into functions such as 'data' parameter in 'json_write'; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON string to file via 'file()' function; no untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data -> map_nested_dicts with smart_str -> json.dumps with json_encoder -> write to file",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'file()' function instead of 'open()'; reliance on Python 2 constructs like 'collections.Mapping' and 'iteritems()'. No exception handling around file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for JSON serialization and nested dict processing. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of deprecated functions indicates outdated Python 2 code but does not imply malicious intent. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with minor concerns about outdated syntax. No evidence of malicious activity or sabotage is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or malware. The low security risk scores are justified, primarily due to outdated syntax practices. Updating to modern Python standards is recommended but not critical for security.",
