{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for mapping nested dictionaries, encoding data into JSON format, and writing JSON data to a file.",
  "sources": "The data parameter in json_write(), data processed through map_nested_dicts() and smart_str().",
  "sinks": "The file() function writing JSON string to a file; json.dumps() for serialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'data' through map_nested_dicts() and smart_str(), then into json.dumps(), and finally written to disk via file().",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'file()' instead of 'open()' function (deprecated in Python 2), which could be intentional or outdated but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard data serialization and file writing operations. Functions handle nested dictionary processing and JSON serialization, including datetime and unicode handling. The use of 'file()' suggests the code is written for Python 2, but there are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious network activity. No external input sources are directly used within the code, only data passed into functions. The functions seem intended for data processing, not for malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical utility module for JSON serialization and file writing, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not perform any suspicious actions or contain malicious payloads.",
