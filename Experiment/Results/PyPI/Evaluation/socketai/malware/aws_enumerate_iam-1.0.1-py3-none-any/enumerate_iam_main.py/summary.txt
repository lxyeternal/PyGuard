  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an AWS IAM enumeration tool but contains embedded malicious activity—sending AWS credentials and permission details to an external server—justifying high malware and security risk scores. The external URL is obfuscated via base64, and the behavior suggests potential exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The scores across reports are consistent with these findings."
