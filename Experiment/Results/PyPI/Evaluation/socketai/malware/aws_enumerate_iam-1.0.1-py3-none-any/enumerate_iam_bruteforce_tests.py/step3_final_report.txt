{
  "purpose": "A static dictionary listing AWS service API actions, likely used for permission enumeration, testing, or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code is a static Python dictionary with keys representing AWS services and values as lists of API action names.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows or runtime operations; the data is static and used as reference.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'BRUTEFORCE_TESTS' may imply testing, but the code itself contains only static data without executable logic or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large static dictionary of AWS API actions, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets. It appears to serve as a reference or enumeration list. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The extensive list could be used for reconnaissance or permission auditing but is benign in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data structure intended for permissions enumeration or testing purposes. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
