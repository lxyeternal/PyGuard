{
  "purpose": "The code defines a dictionary of AWS service names mapped to lists of method names, likely used for enumerating resources or configurations within those services.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a static dictionary data structure, with no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications; the code is purely data definition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code only initializes a data structure without runtime execution flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a large, static dictionary with method names associated with various AWS services. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive dictionary mapping AWS service identifiers to their respective method names, likely used for permission checks, API enumeration, or documentation purposes. It contains no logic, no input handling, no network or file operations. Its structure is straightforward, serving as a reference list. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or exploit vectors. The absence of dynamic code execution, no embedded scripts, and no network interactions suggest a benign utility data structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static dictionary mapping AWS service method names. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a resource enumeration or reference data, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
