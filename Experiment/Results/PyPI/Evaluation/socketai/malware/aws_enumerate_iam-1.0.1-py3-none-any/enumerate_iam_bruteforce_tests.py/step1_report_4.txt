{
  "purpose": "The code defines a dictionary of various AWS service prefixes mapped to lists of their respective API actions, likely for use in a security or access control context.",
  "sources": "The code reads or defines static data structures, specifically the dictionary 'BRUTEFORCE_TESTS'. There are no external input sources or dynamic data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; the code does not perform data output, network operations, or invoke external commands. It solely initializes a data structure.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the dictionary is static and used internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a large static dictionary mapping service prefixes to action lists. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The variable name 'BRUTEFORCE_TESTS' could imply it is used to test brute-force scenarios, but the code itself does not perform such actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary mapping AWS service prefixes to their associated API actions. No external inputs, outputs, or executable code are included. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic. The variable name may suggest intended testing, but without operational code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms are present. The structure appears to be a reference or configuration data for testing or access mapping purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data structure without any malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose appears to be related to defining API actions per AWS service, possibly for testing or access control purposes. No suspicious activities or malware are evident.",
