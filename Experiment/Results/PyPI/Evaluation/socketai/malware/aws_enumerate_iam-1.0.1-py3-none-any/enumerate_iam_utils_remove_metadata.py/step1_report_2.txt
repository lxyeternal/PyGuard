  "purpose": "Function to remove 'ResponseMetadata' key from a boto3 response dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'boto_response', which is expected to be a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None; the function only modifies and returns the input dictionary.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' flows through the function; if it is a dict, 'ResponseMetadata' is removed, then the dict is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; the code performs a simple, safe data modification.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the input is a dictionary, then removes the 'ResponseMetadata' key if it exists. This is a typical pattern for cleaning up AWS SDK responses to exclude metadata. No external data is fetched or sent, no code injection or malicious activity detected. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It operates solely on a dictionary input and performs a benign modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and performs a harmless cleanup operation on AWS SDK responses. There is no indication of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues.",
