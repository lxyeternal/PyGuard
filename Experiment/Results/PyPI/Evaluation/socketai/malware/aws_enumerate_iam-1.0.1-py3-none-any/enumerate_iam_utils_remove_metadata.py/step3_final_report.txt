  "purpose": "Remove 'ResponseMetadata' key from boto3 AWS SDK response dictionaries to sanitize responses.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'boto_response' which is expected to be a dictionary, potentially containing 'ResponseMetadata'.",
  "sinks": "The function modifies the input dictionary in place; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' is checked for type, then 'ResponseMetadata' key is removed if present, and the same object is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a simple type check and dictionary key removal, a common AWS SDK response handling pattern. No obfuscation, no external data flows, and no malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight securityRisk score of 0.1 could be lowered to 0, as the operation is benign and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for cleaning AWS responses, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its safety. The current scores are reasonable; I recommend setting the securityRisk score to 0 for maximum accuracy.",
