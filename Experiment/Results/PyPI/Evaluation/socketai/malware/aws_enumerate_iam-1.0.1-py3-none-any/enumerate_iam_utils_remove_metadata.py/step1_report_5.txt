{
  "purpose": "The function aims to remove the 'ResponseMetadata' key from a dictionary representing a response, likely from a Boto3 AWS SDK call.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'boto_response', which is expected to be a dictionary containing response data from AWS SDK.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects are present; the function only modifies the input object in-place.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through a type check, then potential removal of a specific key, with no further processing or output that could introduce security issues.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and performs a common data sanitization task.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the input 'boto_response' is a dictionary and, if so, removes the 'ResponseMetadata' key. This operation is safe and does not involve untrusted data processing, external communication, or code execution. It appears to be a utility function for cleaning AWS response objects, with no malicious intent or security risks. The code structure is simple, with minimal risk of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for cleaning AWS SDK responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply removes metadata from AWS responses, which is common in AWS SDK integrations.",
