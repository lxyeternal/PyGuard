  "purpose": "Remove 'ResponseMetadata' key from a boto3 response dictionary to clean up or reduce response size.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'boto_response', which is expected to be a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The pop method modifies the input dictionary directly; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' is checked for type, then modified by removing a specific key if present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs a straightforward dictionary key removal with proper type check.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if 'boto_response' is a dictionary, then removes the 'ResponseMetadata' key if it exists. This is a common practice when handling AWS SDK responses to strip metadata. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscated code. The function is simple and direct, with no external data flows or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign operation related to AWS SDK response processing. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
