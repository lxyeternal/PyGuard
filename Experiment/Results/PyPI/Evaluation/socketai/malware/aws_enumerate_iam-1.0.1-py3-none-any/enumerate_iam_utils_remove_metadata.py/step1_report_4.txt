  "purpose": "Function to remove 'ResponseMetadata' key from a boto3 response dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'boto_response', which is expected to be a dictionary (likely an AWS SDK response).",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leak or untrusted data handling; no output leaks or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' is checked and modified in-place by removing 'ResponseMetadata' key, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward removal of a specific dictionary key without additional complex or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the input is a dictionary and removes the 'ResponseMetadata' key if present, then returns the modified dictionary. The operation is a simple data sanitization step, likely used to clean response data from AWS SDK calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The code does not handle or process any untrusted input in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The code is minimal and appears to serve a utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for cleaning AWS SDK responses. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The function's purpose is to remove metadata from a response object, with no evident malicious intent.",
