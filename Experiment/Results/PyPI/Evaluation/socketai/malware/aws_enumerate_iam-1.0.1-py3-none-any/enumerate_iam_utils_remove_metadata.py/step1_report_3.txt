{
  "purpose": "Function to remove 'ResponseMetadata' key from a boto3 response dictionary",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'boto_response' which is expected to be a dictionary",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the input dictionary by removing a specific key, which could impact data handling but is not inherently dangerous",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' is checked for type, then the 'ResponseMetadata' key is removed if present, returning the modified object",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; the operation is straightforward and standard for AWS responses",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the input is a dictionary, then removes the 'ResponseMetadata' key if it exists, likely to clean AWS response objects for further processing. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, as this is a common pattern for sanitizing AWS SDK responses. There are no obfuscation techniques or malicious code snippets present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function to remove metadata from AWS responses; it poses no security risk or malicious intent. The code is standard and safe.",
