  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, anomalies, and potential malicious actions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data inputs, dynamic code execution points (e.g., eval/exec), configuration files, network or file I/O (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, system commands execution.",
  "flows": "From data input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file system, especially where untrusted data could influence behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, unusual control flow, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no suspicious patterns in most reports, with minimal or no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and benign data flows. Report 5 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but lacks concrete malicious actions. Scores are generally consistent with the descriptions, with malware scores of 0 or low, obfuscation scores reflecting actual obfuscation presence, and low security risks. Slight adjustments could be made to risk scores in obfuscated cases, but overall, the assessments are justified.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with appropriate scoring. Obfuscation in Report 5 warrants cautious scoring but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears low risk, with scores aligned to observed behaviors.",
