  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs are evident without code content. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are apparent.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code details provided for a step-by-step analysis. No indicators of malicious behavior, unusual patterns, or security risks are observable from the empty input. Cannot identify sources, sinks, or flows without code.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review. Based on the absence of code, there are no detectable malicious behaviors or security risks. Confidence is low due to lack of data.",
