{
  "purpose": "Define generic classes for testing behavior of generics across modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, class definitions for A and B, including nested class A within B",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is solely class definitions and type variables",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports TypeVar and Generic from typing to define generic classes. Class A is a straightforward generic class. Class B contains a nested class A that is also generic. There are no functions, data input, or operations that could be exploited. The structure appears to serve as a test or demonstration of generic behaviors. No malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code does not perform any runtime actions or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup for testing generics in Python, with no malicious or security concerns detected. It appears benign and intended for type-related testing or demonstration purposes.",
