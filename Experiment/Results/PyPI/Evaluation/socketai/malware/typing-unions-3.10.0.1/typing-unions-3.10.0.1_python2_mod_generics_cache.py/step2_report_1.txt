  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the original code.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- Defines a type variable `T`.\n- Declares class `A` as a generic class.\n- Declares class `B`, which contains a nested class `A`, also generic.\n- The code is static, purely for testing or demonstration of generics.\n- No runtime data processing, external input, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Testing generics across modules.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the code is static, for type testing, with no malicious intent.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, testing generics.\n- **Analysis:** Same as Report 1, emphasizes the structure is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Testing behavior of generics.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Testing generics.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code is benign, no external input or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Testing generics, nested classes.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, for testing purposes.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The nested class `A` inside `B` is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No external data sources, no runtime actions, no network or I/O.\n\n### Final Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** Given the static, benign nature, **0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is straightforward, so **0**.\n- **Risk:** Since there's no malicious activity or security concern, **0**.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.\n- No need to increase scores; the code is clearly safe.\n- The high confidence levels are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**            | **0**     |\n\nThe code is purely for testing generics, with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
