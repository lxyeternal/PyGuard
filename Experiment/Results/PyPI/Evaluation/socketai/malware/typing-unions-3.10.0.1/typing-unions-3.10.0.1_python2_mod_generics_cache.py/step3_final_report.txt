  "purpose": "Testing the behavior of generics across different modules.",
  "sources": "No external input; static class definitions and type variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static type declarations without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual nested class 'A' inside class 'B', but syntactically valid and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type variable 'T' and two classes 'A' and 'B', with 'B' containing a nested class 'A'. It is purely static, intended for testing or demonstration of Python generics, with no runtime data handling, external inputs, or malicious behavior. The nested class 'A' within 'B' is unconventional but not suspicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is minimal (0 or 0.1), reflecting the static and safe nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a simple test of Python generics. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
