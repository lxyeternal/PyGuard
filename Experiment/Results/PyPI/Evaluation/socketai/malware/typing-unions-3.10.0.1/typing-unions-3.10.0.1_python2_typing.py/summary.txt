  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex type hinting library with no malicious intent. The eval() usage in '_ForwardRef' is a known pattern necessary for forward reference resolution but poses a security consideration if inputs are untrusted. No signs of malware, backdoors, or external data exfiltration are detected. The namespace manipulations are standard. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) due to eval() usage, which is typical in such implementations. Overall, the code is safe in context, with minor caution advised regarding eval() if inputs are externally influenced."
