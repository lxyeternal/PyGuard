  "purpose": "Define generic classes with type annotations for testing generic behavior across modules, including conditional code for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, exec(dedent(...)), __annotations__, class definitions, type hints, and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential vulnerabilities. The code mainly defines classes and variables.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version-dependent code, setting of optional variables, class attribute definitions with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with dedented code for Python >= 3.6; no external input or untrusted data sources; no apparent malicious code or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The script defines generic classes with annotations, including conditional execution depending on Python version. The use of exec to define variables and classes dynamically is unusual but not inherently malicious; it appears to be for compatibility. No external input, no network calls, or system modifications are present. The code does not perform any dangerous operations or data leakage. It seems to serve as a test module for generic behaviors. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, mainly defining generic class structures with conditional compatibility handling. No malicious intent, no suspicious network or system activities are evident. The use of exec for dynamic code execution is for compatibility, not malicious.",
