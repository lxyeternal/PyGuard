{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be for testing the behavior of Python generics and type annotations across different modules and Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, exec(dedent(...)), get_type_hints (mentioned in comments), and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. It primarily manipulates type annotations and class definitions.",
  "flows": "The code reads Python version info and executes conditional code, which sets type annotations and class structures, but does not process external untrusted data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec(dedent(...)) to dynamically execute code, which can be risky if the input is not controlled, but here it appears static. The code comments mention 'unless somebody calls get_type_hints with localns=B.__dict__', indicating awareness of dynamic typing behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically defines type annotations and class structures depending on the Python version. The use of exec with static code is unusual but not inherently malicious. No external inputs, network operations, file I/O, or sensitive data handling are present. The code appears to be for testing or illustrating Python generics behavior. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing generic behavior and type annotations in Python. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The use of exec is a potential concern but appears controlled in this context.",
