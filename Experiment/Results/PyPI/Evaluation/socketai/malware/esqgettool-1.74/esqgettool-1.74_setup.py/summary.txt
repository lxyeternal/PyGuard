  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high likelihood of malicious intent, primarily due to the execution of an obfuscated, stealthy PowerShell command triggered conditionally. The suspicious URL comment and silent execution reinforce malicious suspicion. The setup script itself appears benign but is exploited as a vector for malicious payload delivery. Scores reflect high security risk and malware potential."
