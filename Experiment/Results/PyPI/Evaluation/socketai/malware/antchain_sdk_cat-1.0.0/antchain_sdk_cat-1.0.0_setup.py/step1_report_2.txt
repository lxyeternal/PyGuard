{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that includes a custom installation command.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom run method executes, collecting system info (source) and transmitting it over the network (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information to an external server during package install, which is atypical for standard setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules and defines a CustomInstall class overriding the run method. In this method, it gathers system info: hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL, passing this data as parameters. The purpose appears to be data exfiltration during installation. This behavior resembles malicious activity, such as user tracking or reconnaissance, embedded within a package setup process. No other malicious code or obfuscated features are present. The external URL is suspicious and likely used for tracking or command-and-control activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, indicating likely malicious intent. It is a supply chain attack vector designed to gather user environment data surreptitiously.",
