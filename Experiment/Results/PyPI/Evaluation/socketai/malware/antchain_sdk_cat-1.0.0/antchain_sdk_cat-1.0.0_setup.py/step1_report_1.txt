  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests, socket, getpass, os; during install run method execution.",
  "sinks": "requests.get to an external server with system information.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects environment info and exfiltrates it to an external server without user consent; no visible user prompt or warning; use of hardcoded URL; custom install class executing network request post-install.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install class that overrides the run method. After executing the standard install, it gathers system info such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a specified external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration and could be malicious, as it gathers system information silently during installation without user awareness. The URL used is hardcoded and appears suspicious. No other malicious actions or obfuscation are present. The code’s purpose appears to be covert data collection during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, performing covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system info to an external server without user consent. This is a significant security concern and indicates malicious intent.",
