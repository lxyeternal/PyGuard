{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the run method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends the collected data to http://5r13v9.ceye.io, which acts as the sink for exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the source variables (hostname, cwd, username) directly into the requests.get() call, transmitting to the external URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing network requests during package setup without user consent, collecting system info covertly, and using a suspicious external URL.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, after executing the standard install process, gathers system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, which is indicative of data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and performs a covert operation during package installation. This behavior is malicious, as it invades user privacy and could be exploited for malicious reconnaissance or tracking. The external URL (ceye.io) is often used in security testing but in this context appears suspicious. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack patterns, and the malicious intent is clear. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are justified based on the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior involving covert data exfiltration during package installation. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate and justified. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, this package poses a significant security threat and should be flagged or removed from distribution channels.",
