  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script that includes a custom installation step to send system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "Code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "Requests module makes an HTTP GET request to an external server with collected data.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent to external server via requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during package installation, sending sensitive system info without user consent. No user prompt or control over this behavior. The URL appears suspicious and used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. Inside run, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external URL via HTTP GET request. The URL (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) is suspicious and indicates potential data exfiltration or tracking. This behavior is embedded in the package setup process, which is executed automatically during installation. No validation, user notification, or opt-out is provided, and the external request is hardcoded. The code could be malicious or at least privacy-invasive, intended to collect user system data without consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external server without user consent. This is highly suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent or privacy violation. The behavior is embedded in the setup script, making it a supply chain security risk.",
