{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation step for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io).",
  "flows": "During installation, system data (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source points to the requests.get call, which transmits data to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration by sending system info to an external domain without user consent, which is suspicious. Use of custom install class to include network activity in setup script is unusual and potentially malicious. The URL used for data collection appears to be a test or research server, but its purpose is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py script overrides the install command to execute code that gathers system information and transmits it remotely during package installation. This behavior is atypical for a standard package and indicates an attempt to exfiltrate data, potentially for malicious purposes. The code does not include any clear malicious payload such as damaging files or remote control; however, the exfiltration behavior itself is a significant security concern. The URL used suggests it may be used for tracking or data collection. There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious code, but the behavior is highly suspicious in the context of supply chain security.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system data during installation, which is a supply chain attack vector. It attempts to secretly send user information to an external server, posing a privacy risk. This code should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious for data exfiltration.",
