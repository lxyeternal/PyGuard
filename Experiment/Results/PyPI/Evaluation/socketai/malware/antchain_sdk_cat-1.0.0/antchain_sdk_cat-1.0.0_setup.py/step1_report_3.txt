{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step to send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the environment and system during installation.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) with system information as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "During installation, the script gathers hostname, cwd, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to the specified remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a custom install class to exfiltrate system data without user consent. No user input is involved, but data collection and transmission are hidden within the installation process. The URL appears suspicious, and the purpose is likely data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that extends setuptools' install class. During the run method, it collects system data: hostname, current directory, and username, then transmits this information to an external server via a GET request. The use of such a method during package installation without user knowledge is indicative of malicious or at least suspicious behavior, likely intended for system fingerprinting or data exfiltration. The request URL is hosted on a domain associated with Ceye.io, a known tool used for security testing and possibly malicious exfiltration in some contexts. Overall, the code demonstrates hidden data leakage via a seemingly benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior, specifically covert data exfiltration during package installation. The use of hidden system information collection and transmission to an external server indicates malicious intent, or at least malicious potential. This package should be considered dangerous for supply chain security.",
