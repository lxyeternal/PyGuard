{
  "purpose": "The code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, system info, and files. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads, decrypts stored credentials, searches user directories for sensitive files, terminates processes to access locked data, installs dependencies dynamically, and employs multithreading for stealth.",
  "sources": "Local browser databases (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, Yandex), Discord, Steam, Telegram directories, user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents), environment variables, network requests for geolocation, local files containing credentials and tokens.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks, file uploads to third-party services (gofile.io, anonfiles, transfer.sh), process termination commands (taskkill), writing to temporary files, and network transmissions of collected data.",
  "flows": "Reads and decrypts stored credentials, tokens, cookies, and files from local databases and directories, then transmits this data over network connections via webhooks or uploads, often after zipping or encoding. Uses threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, dynamic dependency installation via subprocess, process termination commands, threading for concurrent operations, decryption routines for stored credentials, and functions with names indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code actively searches for sensitive data across multiple browsers and applications, decrypts stored credentials, and exfiltrates this data through network requests. It terminates processes to access locked files, installs dependencies without user consent, and employs threading to evade detection. The presence of hardcoded webhooks and file uploads confirms malicious exfiltration. The code's structure and behavior align with known malware patterns, with functions explicitly designed for data theft and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info stealer that exfiltrates tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. It employs multiple techniques to evade detection and maximize data theft. The high malware and security risk scores are justified; obfuscation is minimal but present. Overall, the code poses a severe threat and should be flagged and removed immediately.",
