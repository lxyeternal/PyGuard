  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious, functioning as a comprehensive info stealer that exfiltrates tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. It employs multiple techniques to evade detection and maximize data theft. The high malware and security risk scores are justified; obfuscation is minimal but present. Overall, the code poses a severe threat and should be flagged and removed immediately."
