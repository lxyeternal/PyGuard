{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers and applications, and then exfiltrate this data via webhooks to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Sources include browser storage files (Login Data, Cookies, Local State), log files, and various application directories for wallets, gaming, and other data. Data is read from local files, database files, and in-memory variables.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to a Discord webhook URL through POST requests, potentially exposing sensitive user data. Files are also uploaded to third-party services via requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local storage (browser files, application directories) into in-memory variables (tokens, passwords, cookies), then is sent over network to remote webhook URLs or uploaded files, completing the exfiltration process.",
  "anomalies": "Includes hardcoded webhook URL, attempts to silently install dependencies, uses threading excessively for obfuscation, and executes system commands to kill processes, which are suspicious behaviors. Presence of code that decrypts stored data with master keys suggests malicious intent. The code gathers tokens, cookies, passwords, and files without user consent. The use of repeated subprocess calls to kill processes and aggressive threading indicates an attempt to avoid detection. Additionally, the code attempts to automatically install dependencies and disable processes, which is uncommon in legitimate software.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a stealer, collecting sensitive data such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and files from browsers and applications, then exfiltrates this data to a Discord webhook. It uses cryptographic functions to decrypt stored credentials, suggests malware behavior due to silent process termination and data exfiltration. Hardcoded webhook, dependency installation, and extensive system access are indicators of malicious activity. The code is structured to maximize data collection stealthily, with multiple threads and automated dependencies, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious. It functions as a credential and data stealer, collecting sensitive information from user browsers and applications, then exfiltrating it via a webhook. The presence of hardcoded URLs, decryption routines, silent process termination, and automatic dependency installation strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at unauthorized data theft.",
