{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and personal files from a user's system, then exfiltrating this data via webhook to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads input/data from log files, browser storage (Local Storage, LevelDB, SQLite databases), environment variables, and files in user directories like Desktop, Downloads, and Documents.",
  "sinks": "Sends data to external URLs via HTTP requests (webhooks, file uploads to third-party servers). Reads sensitive data from system files and browser storage, and executes commands to kill processes and compress files.",
  "flows": "Sources (local system files, browser databases, environment variables) are read and decrypted, then data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files are collected. These are then sent to external webhooks and file hosting services, or compressed for upload.",
  "anomalies": "Code installs libraries dynamically (requests, pycryptodome), employs obfuscated or indirect regex patterns for token extraction, uses threading excessively for concurrent operations, and includes functions for uploading files to third-party services. The code also kills processes like browsers and applications (e.g., Steam, Metamask) unexpectedly. Multiple hardcoded URLs and payloads indicate malicious intent. The code does not validate user consent and actively searches user directories for sensitive info.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system and user data, including IP address, browser data, Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, and personal files from common directories. It decrypts stored browser credentials using master keys, extracts Discord account info and badges, and retrieves billing info. It employs threading to perform multiple tasks concurrently, such as zipping files and collecting data. It then exfiltrates data via webhooks and uploads to third-party file hosts. The code kills process instances to prevent interference. Overall, it combines multiple data theft techniques with obfuscation strategies, designed for stealth and maximum data extraction. These behaviors align with typical credential-stealing malware, with no user consent or transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, aiming to harvest and exfiltrate user credentials, tokens, cookies, personal files, and system information without user consent. It uses various techniques to decrypt stored credentials, avoid detection, and transmit data stealthily, fulfilling criteria for malware with high malicious intent. Its multiple data exfiltration points and process-killing mechanisms confirm its harmful nature.",
