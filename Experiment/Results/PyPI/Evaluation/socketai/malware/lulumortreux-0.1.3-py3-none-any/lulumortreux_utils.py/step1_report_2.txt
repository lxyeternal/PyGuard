{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious credential and data stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, files, and other sensitive information from user systems, and exfiltrates data via Discord webhooks and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from log files, database files (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Discord, Steam, Telegram), environment variables, and local system files (Local State, Local Storage, Files in Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It also reads network data and decodes encrypted data like cookies and passwords.",
  "sinks": "Uploads collected data (tokens, cookies, passwords, files) to Discord webhooks and third-party file hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh, anonfiles). It executes shell commands to kill processes and install modules. It also writes data into local files for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources include reading log files, databases, environment variables, and system files. Data is decrypted, validated, and then transmitted via HTTP POST requests to external servers. The flow includes decoding encrypted tokens and cookies, then uploading tokens, cookies, passwords, and files to remote servers via HTTP requests, often after processing or zipping files.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded webhook URL, obfuscated or convoluted code structures, dynamic module installation via subprocess, extensive system file access, process termination commands (taskkill), and collection of various sensitive data across multiple browsers and applications. Use of threading for parallel data collection is also suspicious. The code also forcibly kills processes and attempts to hide its activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data including Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, files, and system info. It automates the collection from multiple browsers, Discord, Steam, and Telegram directories, decrypts stored data, and uploads this data to external servers. It employs multiple techniques to hide its activity, including process termination and dynamic module installation. The use of hardcoded webhooks and third-party upload services confirms malicious intent. The code structure and style suggest obfuscation or at least an attempt to hide the malicious functions. Overall, the script functions as a comprehensive info stealer targeting user credentials and files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, functioning as a credential and data stealer, exfiltrating sensitive user information and files to external servers via webhooks and file hosting services. It employs multiple methods to access, decrypt, and transmit data, and attempts to conceal its activity through process termination and obfuscated code segments. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be blocked and removed.",
