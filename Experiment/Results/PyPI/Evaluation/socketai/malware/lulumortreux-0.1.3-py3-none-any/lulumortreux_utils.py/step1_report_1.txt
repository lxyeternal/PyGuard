{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious payload designed for data theft, including stealing tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and system information from user devices, and exfiltrating this data via webhooks or file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input sources include local files (logs, browser databases, cookies, local state files), environment variables, and network requests to specific URLs for geolocation, token validation, and data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration occurs through HTTP POST requests to webhooks and file uploads to external servers, as well as writing to temporary files for collecting stolen data. It also terminates processes and manipulates files on the system.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading local files and system information, decrypting tokens/passwords, validating tokens, then sending sensitive data (tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, files) to external webhooks or upload links.",
  "anomalies": "Obvious malicious behavior includes token validation and exfiltration, password and cookie extraction from browsers, file collection based on suspicious keywords, process termination commands, and use of hardcoded webhook URLs. The code also dynamically installs dependencies without user consent and contains many sleep and thread joins to hide activity timing. The presence of functions explicitly named for stealing and uploading user data indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script actively searches for and decrypts stored browser credentials, cookies, and tokens from various browsers and applications. It also searches user directories for files matching keywords related to sensitive information and zips/ uploads them. The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: persistent network communication with external servers, process killing commands, decryption of sensitive data, and exfiltration via webhooks. The usage of hardcoded URLs, dynamic dependency installation, and process termination commands further support malicious intent. The code is structured to maximize stealth, including multithreading and sleep calls, but the overall purpose clearly indicates malicious data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a comprehensive stealer targeting tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and system info for exfiltration. It operates stealthily, interacts with external servers, and manipulates local files to gather and transmit sensitive user data without consent.",
