{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed to extract, steal, and exfiltrate sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various applications and browsers, then upload this data to external servers and notify via Discord webhooks. It functions as a credential and data stealer, likely for malicious use.",
  "sources": "Sources include local browser data directories, application data folders (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Discord, Steam, Riot, Exodus, Telegram), and log/ldb files within user directories. It also reads environment variables, files, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (Gofile, Discord webhooks, Anonfiles), and stored temporarily in local files. Sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and system info are exfiltrated to remote servers.",
  "flows": "Sources such as browser storage, log files, and app data are parsed to extract tokens, passwords, cookies, and files. Extracted tokens are validated and then used to gather additional user info. The data is compiled into structured messages or files and transmitted to remote servers via HTTP requests. The flow involves reading, decrypting, and uploading user credentials and files.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically installs dependencies, gathers tokens, cookies, passwords from multiple browsers, and exfiltrates sensitive data using multiple external endpoints. It includes attempts to kill processes, zip files, and upload to anonymized servers. There is usage of hardcoded webhook URLs, suspicious URL parsing, and indirect detection of tokens. The use of obfuscated regex patterns for token extraction, and the combination of multiple credential-stealing techniques is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code operates as a credential stealer by locating browser data directories, decrypting stored passwords and cookies, extracting tokens, and compiling this data for exfiltration. It installs required libraries automatically, which indicates an attempt to ensure dependencies are present. It utilizes threading for parallel data collection. Functions such as 'upload', 'ZipTelegram', and 'GatherZips' are used to package and send data to external servers, including Discord webhooks and file hosting services. The code also searches user directories for sensitive files matching certain keywords, and gathers system info like IP, username, and geolocation. Several functions manipulate system processes to terminate applications before copying data, which could indicate sabotage or data theft activities. Overall, the code is a comprehensive credential harvesting tool with obfuscated regex, hardcoded webhook, and multi-faceted data exfiltration, all characteristic of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This script is clearly malicious, functioning as a credential and data stealer. It targets browsers, applications, and user files to extract sensitive information, then exfiltrates the data via web requests to external servers. The use of process termination, automatic dependency installation, and obfuscated regex patterns further indicates intent to operate stealthily and comprehensively. It should be considered highly dangerous and should not be run or used in any environment.",
