  "purpose": "This code appears to be a malicious stealer designed to extract sensitive data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from user systems, then exfiltrate this information via Discord webhooks and file uploads.",

    "Input from log files, browser storage, and local system files",
    "Environment variables for user data and paths",

  "flows": [
    "Extracts tokens, passwords, cookies from browser and app data directories -> Encodes or decrypts sensitive data -> Sends data via HTTP POST to Discord webhook or gofile.io",
    "Reads system info (IP, username, geolocation) -> Combines with extracted credentials -> Sends to webhook",
    "Downloads or installs required Python modules if missing -> Executes system commands to kill processes, zip files, and upload data"

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration",
    "Persistent and extensive data collection from multiple browsers, apps, and files without user consent",
    "Installation of missing modules via subprocess and pip commands at runtime",
    "Attempting to decrypt stored credentials and tokens",
    "Killing system processes forcibly with 'taskkill' for specific applications",
    "Uploading files directly to third-party hosting services (gofile.io, transfer.sh) without user knowledge"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script is designed as a comprehensive info stealer, targeting browsers, Discord tokens, wallet data, and other sensitive files. It uses various techniques including decrypting stored credentials, extracting tokens via regex, collecting system and geolocation info, and exfiltrating data through webhooks and file upload APIs. The presence of hardcoded webhook, forced process termination, runtime module installation, and broad data collection strongly suggest malicious intent. No obfuscation is evident, but the code is complex and extensive, indicating intent to compromise user privacy and security systematically.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a malicious data stealer, gathering sensitive credentials, cookies, tokens, and files from the system, then exfiltrating this data stealthily via webhooks and uploads. It actively kills processes and installs modules at runtime to maximize data extraction. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and multiple exfiltration methods indicates high malicious intent and security risk.",
