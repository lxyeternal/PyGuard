{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive credential, token, and data stealer targeting browsers, Discord, Steam, Telegram, wallets, and other applications. It decrypts stored credentials, extracts tokens via regex, collects system info, and exfiltrates all gathered data through Discord webhooks and file hosting services, employing stealth techniques like process termination and silent dependency installation.",
  "sources": "Reads local files from browser profiles, application directories, logs, environment variables, and network responses; decrypts stored passwords and tokens; accesses user directories and system info.",
  "sinks": "Uploads sensitive data via Discord webhooks, gofile.io, anonfiles.com, transfer.sh; writes data to temporary files; sends network requests to exfiltrate tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and system info.",
  "flows": "Source data is collected from local storage, decrypted, and processed; then transmitted through network requests (webhooks, file uploads); process termination and dependency installation occur concurrently to evade detection; data flows from local files and environment variables to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded webhook URL; silently installs dependencies; terminates processes to access data files; employs regex patterns for token extraction; minimal obfuscation in variable names and regex; extensive threading for parallel data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware: decrypting stored credentials, extracting tokens via regex, collecting cookies and passwords, terminating processes to access in-use data, installing dependencies silently, and exfiltrating data via multiple channels. Regex patterns and variable names show some obfuscation, but not heavily encrypted or encrypted code. The presence of hardcoded webhooks and process termination commands confirms malicious intent. The code's structure supports stealth and comprehensive data theft, aligning with typical credential stealers and info-stealers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious malware designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and system compromise. It employs multiple stealth techniques, decrypts stored credentials, extracts tokens, and exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads. The overall threat level is maximum, with high confidence in its malicious nature.",
