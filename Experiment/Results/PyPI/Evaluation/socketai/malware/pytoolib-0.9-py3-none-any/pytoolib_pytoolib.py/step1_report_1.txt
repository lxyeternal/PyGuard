{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a malicious credential and data stealer targeting various applications including browsers, Discord, Steam, and other services. It extracts tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, then uploads the stolen data to external servers, primarily Discord webhooks and file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user environment variables, local files (browser databases, logs, config files), open network connections to APIs and webhooks, and user data stored within browser directories, Discord, Steam, and other applications.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks and file hosting services (e.g., gofile.io, anonfiles.com). Files are created locally (e.g., passwords, cookies, zip archives) and uploaded externally.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from reading local files, extracting tokens, passwords, and cookies, then assembling and sending this data through network requests to external servers. The code also downloads and executes external modules and may install packages silently.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious behaviors include: silent installation of dependencies, stealthy token extraction via regex from log files, token validation before exfiltration, comprehensive credential harvesting, background thread spawning for parallel data collection, and persistent collection from multiple application paths. The code also terminates processes associated with browsers or wallets to access data files, which is indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to clandestinely extract sensitive user data from multiple applications and browsers by reading stored credentials, cookies, and tokens. It decrypts stored data using Windows API functions and standard cryptography methods, then compiles this data into formatted messages or files. It uploads collected data to external servers, primarily Discord webhooks and file hosting sites, likely for malicious collection. The code also installs required dependencies silently and kills processes to access files in use. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, aiming to steal user credentials, tokens, and files without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, serving as a credential, token, and data stealer targeting various applications and browsers. It exfiltrates sensitive information to external servers, actively kills processes to access data, and employs stealthy techniques to remain covert. Its overall security risk is extremely high, and it should be regarded as dangerous malware.",
