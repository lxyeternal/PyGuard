{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific function 'type_check' from a local or third-party library 'pytoolib.pytoolib' and calls it with the argument 'boolean'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'pytoolib.pytoolib' module; the function call 'type_check('boolean')' uses a string literal as input.",
  "sinks": "The 'type_check' function is a potential sink if it processes untrusted data in an insecure manner; however, since the argument is a static string, it is not an immediate concern.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from the module; function 'type_check' processes the string 'boolean'. No data flows from external untrusted sources into the function call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a library and executes a type check with a hardcoded string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The use of a static string argument minimizes the risk. The overall code is simple and does not contain obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign; it simply performs a type check operation on a hardcoded string. No malicious activity or suspicious behavior is detected.",
