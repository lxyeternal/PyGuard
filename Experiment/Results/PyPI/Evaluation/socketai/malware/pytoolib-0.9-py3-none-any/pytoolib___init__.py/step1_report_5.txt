{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'type_check' from the 'pytoolib.pytoolib' module and calls it with the argument 'boolean'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the string 'boolean' as input to the 'type_check' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'type_check' function is called with the input, potential sink depends on its internal implementation, but based on this code, it could process or validate the input.",
  "flows": "Input 'boolean' flows into 'type_check' function; no further flows are visible as the function's internal behavior is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident; the code appears straightforward. The module name 'pytoolib.pytoolib' is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a third-party module and calls it with a string argument. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The module name might be a custom or less common library, but nothing indicates malicious intent. Without knowledge of 'type_check's internal implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import and function call with a string argument. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
