{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'type_check' from the 'pytoolib.pytoolib' module and calls it with a static string 'boolean'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pytoolib.pytoolib', calling 'type_check' with a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "The 'type_check' function, which could potentially process or validate the input, but no external untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'type_check' -> invocation with static argument 'boolean'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and function call with static data.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and performs a benign operation: importing a utility function and calling it with a fixed string. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior. The trustworthiness of 'pytoolib' is unknown, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe. The 'type_check' function's internal behavior is unknown, but no malicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import and function call with static data. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The risk and malware scores are appropriate, and the confidence level is high. Unless the external library 'pytoolib' is malicious, the code poses no security threat.",
