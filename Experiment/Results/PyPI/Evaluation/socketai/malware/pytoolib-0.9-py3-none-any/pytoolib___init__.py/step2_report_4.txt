  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the reported issues, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is straightforward: import a function from 'pytoolib.pytoolib' and call it with the string 'boolean'.\n- No evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, data exfiltration, or other malicious behaviors.\n- The 'pytoolib' library appears to be a utility or third-party library, but its trustworthiness cannot be confirmed solely from this code.\n- The 'type_check' function's internal implementation is unknown, which limits certainty about its behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**Presence of issues in code:**\n- The code itself is benign; no issues are present in the actual code snippet.\n- The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of the 'pytoolib' library and what 'type_check' does internally.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the simplicity of the code and the lack of suspicious patterns.\n- They mention that 'type_check' could be a sink depending on its implementation, but without internal details, this remains speculative.\n- No report claims actual malicious behavior, which aligns with the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.6-0.9), which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues with scores:**\n- Since the code is benign, no adjustments are necessary unless new information about 'pytoolib' emerges.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The main uncertainty revolves around the trustworthiness of the 'pytoolib' library and what 'type_check' does internally.\n- Without evidence of malicious behavior, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to external dependency trustworthiness)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, and the scores across all reports are reasonable and justified. No further action is necessary unless additional context about 'pytoolib' indicates malicious intent.",
