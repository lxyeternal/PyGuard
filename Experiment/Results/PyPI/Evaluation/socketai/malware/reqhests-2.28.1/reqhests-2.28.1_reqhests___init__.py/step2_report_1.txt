  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom frequest import get, post, put, patch, delete\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Import HTTP methods from 'frequest'  \n- No anomalies, no malicious activity, benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.  \n- confidence: 1\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThis is a straightforward import statement with no further context. The 'frequest' library appears to be a non-standard or custom module, but no malicious activity is evident from the import alone.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**  \n- Notes that 'frequest' is not a standard library; could be malicious or a typo of 'requests'.  \n- No code usage, just import.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2  \n- confidence: 0.4\n\n**Analysis:**  \nThe suspicion about the library name is valid. The import alone isn't malicious, but the unusual name warrants caution. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**  \n- Similar to above, with suspicion about the library name.  \n- No code usage, just import.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2  \n- confidence: 0.4\n\n**Analysis:**  \nAgain, the import alone isn't malicious, but the suspicious name is noted. The reasoning aligns with the scores.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nAppropriate. No changes.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**  \n- Similar to above, with focus on the suspicious library name.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2  \n- confidence: 0.4\n\n**Analysis:**  \nSame reasoning applies. The import alone is benign but warrants caution.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**  \n- Similar to previous, suspicious library name, no usage.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2  \n- confidence: 0.6\n\n**Analysis:**  \nSlightly higher confidence, but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is just an import statement with no direct malicious activity.\n- The main concern is the library name 'frequest', which is suspicious due to its similarity to 'requests' and the potential for obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the limited context.\n- The security risk scores are low but reflect caution due to the suspicious library name.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the evidence provided.\n- Since no further code is shown, the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero.\n- The security risk score could remain at 0.2, reflecting the suspicion about the library name.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate, considering the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Final judgment:\n**Based on the evidence, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Confidence |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2             | 0.4-0.6    |\n\n**Note:** If further code usage shows malicious behavior, these scores should be updated accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary based solely on the import statement. The main point of concern remains the suspicious library name, which warrants further review if additional code is provided.",
