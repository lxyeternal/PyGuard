  "purpose": "Import HTTP method functions from the 'frequest' module, likely for making HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are used in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; no data flows or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports functions without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'frequest' is non-standard and suspicious, resembling 'requests' but altered, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no execution or data handling. The primary concern is the module name 'frequest', which is not a recognized standard library and may be malicious or a typo. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious activity is demonstrated. The security risk score is set at 0.2, reflecting caution due to the suspicious module name. Confidence scores are appropriate, given the limited context. No obfuscation is evident, and the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation; however, the suspicious module name 'frequest' warrants further investigation if used in larger code. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no malicious activity is detected based solely on this snippet.",
