  "sinks": "No data processing or transmission occurs in this snippet; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; only a simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a library named 'frequest'. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The library appears to be used for making HTTP requests, which is a common operation. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. The import alone does not present any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, involving a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
