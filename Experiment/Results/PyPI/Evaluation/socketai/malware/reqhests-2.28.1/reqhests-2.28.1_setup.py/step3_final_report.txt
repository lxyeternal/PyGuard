  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for building and distributing the Python package 'reqhests'.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; uses static metadata variables; specifies dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no network connections or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> sets package metadata -> specifies dependencies and package data -> executes setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in 'package_dir' mapping ('requests' instead of 'reqhests'), which may cause packaging issues but not security concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The only notable anomaly is the 'package_dir' mapping, which points 'requests' to 'requests' while the package is named 'reqhests', indicating a likely typo or misconfiguration. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The dependencies are standard and do not pose security risks. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code present. The typo does not introduce security vulnerabilities but could affect packaging correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with a minor configuration typo. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The overall security posture is safe, and the only concern is a packaging typo that should be corrected for proper distribution.",
