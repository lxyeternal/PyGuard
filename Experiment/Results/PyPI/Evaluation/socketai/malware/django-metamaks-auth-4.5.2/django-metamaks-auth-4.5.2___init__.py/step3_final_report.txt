  "purpose": "Simple function that prints 'installed' and is invoked immediately.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Static call to print; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and static. It defines a function that prints a message and calls it immediately. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with high confidence (1), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
