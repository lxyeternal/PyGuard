  "purpose": "The code defines a function 'ina' that prints a message and then calls this function.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code is static and does not read any external data.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the 'print' statement which outputs to standard output.",
  "flows": "Function 'ina' is called immediately after its definition, with no data flow from external sources to any sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very simple, with no obfuscated elements, no hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it defines a single function that prints a message and then executes it. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be benign and intended solely for informational output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply outputs a message to the console.",
