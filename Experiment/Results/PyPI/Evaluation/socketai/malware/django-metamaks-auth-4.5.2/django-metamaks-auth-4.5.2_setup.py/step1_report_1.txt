{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom post-installation step to execute additional code.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', URLs within the send() function, and the open() function writing a downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "os.system() command executing a downloaded file, network requests to external URLs, writing binary content to a file.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request with env data -> download of executable file -> execution of the downloaded file via os.system()",
  "anomalies": "Code dynamically downloads and executes an executable file during installation, which is highly suspicious. The URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php...' appears malicious, and the downloaded file is executed immediately without verification. The use of try-except with a silent pass masks errors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a send() function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, sends it via HTTP GET to a suspicious URL, then downloads an executable file from a suspicious domain, and executes it using os.system. The function is called during the custom post-install command in the setup process. This behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain activity, as it downloads and runs an external executable during package installation. The code lacks safeguards like signature verification or user confirmation. Overall, the code performs malicious actions, such as executing downloaded code during setup, indicating high malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains malicious behavior, including downloading and executing an external executable during installation without user consent or verification. It likely serves as a backdoor or malware delivery mechanism, representing a severe security risk.",
