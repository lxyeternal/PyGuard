    "Code reads 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable -> Sends it via GET request to linkedopports.com -> Downloads and executes an executable from python-release.com"

  "anomalies": [
    "Unusual external network activity during package installation",
    "Downloading and executing an executable file during setup",
    "Use of broad exception handling (try/except: pass) that suppresses errors"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that retrieves the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable and sends it to a suspicious URL. It also downloads an executable file from an untrusted source and executes it, which is highly suspicious behavior. The process occurs during package installation via a custom 'PostInstallCommand' class, which runs the 'send' function after the standard installation steps. The use of broad exception handling obscures errors, possibly to evade detection or prevent installation failure alerts. These behaviors indicate potential malicious activity, including remote data exfiltration and executing malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and executing an external executable during package installation. These actions strongly suggest the presence of malware or malicious intent.",
