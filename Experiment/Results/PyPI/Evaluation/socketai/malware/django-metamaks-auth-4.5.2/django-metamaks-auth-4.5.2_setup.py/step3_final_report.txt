{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform malicious activities during package installation, including data exfiltration, downloading, and executing a remote executable without validation.",
  "sources": "Access to environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', network requests to suspicious URLs, download of executable file, execution of downloaded file via os.system()",
  "sinks": "Sending data to external server, executing downloaded executable, potentially malicious URL endpoints",
  "flows": "Retrieving 'COMPUTERNAME' -> sending it via GET request -> downloading executable from a suspicious URL -> executing the executable",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling masking errors, executing unverified external code during setup, sending environment info to external server",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system environment info and exfiltrates it via a network request. It then downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and executes it without validation, all during package setup. The broad exception handling masks errors, potentially hiding failures. The URLs and executable are suspicious, indicating malicious intent. The code's actions are characteristic of malware delivery and backdoor activity, with no obfuscation present. The malicious behavior is explicit and active, warranting maximum malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates clear malicious activity, including data exfiltration, remote code execution, and malware delivery. The behavior justifies assigning a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, it poses a severe security threat and should be considered malicious.",
