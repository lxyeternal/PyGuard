  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a post-installation step to run custom code.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME', external URLs via requests.get, and os.system call to execute downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing the downloaded executable, and requests to external domains potentially transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' -> URL request to linkedopports.com -> download of executable from python-release.com -> execution via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except with broad exception handling, downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable, sends environment info to external server, no validation of downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to send the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to a suspicious URL. It then downloads an executable from a different suspicious domain and runs it without any validation or user consent. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, which could hide malicious failures. These actions indicate an attempt to exfiltrate environment data and execute malicious code on installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by transmitting environment data to an external server and executing a downloaded file without safeguards. It is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a security risk.",
