{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with a custom installation process that performs an additional action post-installation.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and network requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, executing a downloaded file via os.system.",
  "flows": "The 'send()' function reads 'COMPUTERNAME', then sends it via HTTP GET to a specific URL; it also downloads and executes an executable file from a suspicious URL if on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending environment data to an external domain, downloading and executing an executable from a potentially malicious URL, and the absence of any legitimate setup reason for these actions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send()' function that collects the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable, which is a machine identifier. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external domain, passing this info. If on Windows, it downloads an executable from a suspicious URL and attempts to run it, which is a common technique for executing malicious payloads. The 'PostInstallCommand' class extends the install command to run 'send()' after installation. The setup configuration specifies package details with a custom install command. The code's behavior suggests it performs data exfiltration and executes potentially malicious code upon package installation, which is abnormal and suspicious in a package distribution context.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior including environment data exfiltration and remote code execution, indicating a high security risk. It appears intentionally malicious and should be considered unsafe for use.",
