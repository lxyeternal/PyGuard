{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package with custom post-install behavior that includes potentially malicious network activity and executable download.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and external URL requests via requests.get() to 'linkedopports.com' and 'python-release.com'.",
  "sinks": "Downloading and executing an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') using os.system() after fetching it from a remote URL.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' is sent to an external server, then a remote executable is downloaded and executed on Windows systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' for tracking, fetching an executable from a suspicious URL, and executing it automatically during package installation. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and additional modules. The 'send()' function attempts to retrieve system-specific info ('COMPUTERNAME') and sends it to an external URL. On Windows systems, it downloads an executable file from a suspicious URL and executes it automatically. This behavior occurs during package installation via a custom 'PostInstallCommand'. The code does not validate the downloaded file or restrict execution, representing a clear security risk. The use of try-except to ignore errors suggests an attempt to avoid detection or failure halts malicious activity. The overall structure is typical of setup scripts, but the embedded network activity and automatic execution are malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains malicious behavior involving data exfiltration and remote code execution during package installation. The code is designed to silently send system information and run an external executable, representing a high security risk.",
