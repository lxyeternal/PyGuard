{
  "purpose": "The code initializes an empty dictionary intended to store notifications categorized by project and version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to any sink or external system.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines an empty data structure.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains commented-out example code that suggests a pattern for populating the notifications dictionary, but no actual data or dynamic behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining an empty dictionary named 'notifications' intended for storing nested dictionaries. The commented example provides guidance on how to structure data but does not execute any logic or contain dynamic or malicious code. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or data flows that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The code appears to serve as a template or initial setup for future use, with no immediate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data structure initialization with no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a template for storing notifications per project and version, with no active data processing or external interactions.",
