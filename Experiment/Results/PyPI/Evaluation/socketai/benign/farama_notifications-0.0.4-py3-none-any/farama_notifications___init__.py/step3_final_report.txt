  "purpose": "Initialize an empty notifications dictionary with commented examples for future notification entries.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; code does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static assignment of an empty dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static initialization of a dictionary named 'notifications' with commented instructions. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious patterns. The comments serve as documentation for future use. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments are present. The simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template for notification storage, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
