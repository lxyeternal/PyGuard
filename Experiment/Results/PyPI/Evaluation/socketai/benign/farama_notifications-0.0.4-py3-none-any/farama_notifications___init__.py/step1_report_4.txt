  "purpose": "The code initializes an empty dictionary intended to store notifications related to project versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; only defines a data structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; the code only sets up a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The comments indicate an example usage pattern but do not implement it.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an empty dictionary named 'notifications'. It includes comments describing its intended structure and usage for storing project notifications by project name and version. There is no dynamic input, no data processing, and no external interactions. The code appears to be a straightforward data structure setup without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple initialization of a data structure with descriptive comments. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious code. It is safe and typical for setting up notification storage.",
