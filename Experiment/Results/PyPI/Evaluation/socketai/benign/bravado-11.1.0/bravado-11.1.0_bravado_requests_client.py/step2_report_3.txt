  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, potential issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a secure, standard implementation for API requests with authentication. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. It handles SSL verification and request flow securely.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, overall risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code review. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and applies authentication dynamically. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing straightforward, benign HTTP client implementation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, overall risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities based on the review.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard HTTP client with authentication, request preparation, and response wrapping. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, overall risk=0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical API client with authentication and response handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, overall risk=0.\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard HTTP client with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Handles inputs and responses securely.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, overall risk=0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code's structure.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, secure implementation with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  None apparent. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity. Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on the code's actual content, not assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the code?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Personal estimate (step-by-step):**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, due to standard handling, SSL options, and authentication.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured API client implementation. It handles authentication securely, does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The low risk score reflects the standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no security concerns or malicious elements. The scores are justified and align with the detailed analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated=0, and a risk score around 0.1–0.2.",
