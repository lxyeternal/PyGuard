  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes request handling, authentication, response wrapping.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. The code applies authentication dynamically, handles SSL verification securely, and does not contain suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.9). No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; details request flow and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), consistent with the code. Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes the flow of request data and authentication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. Standard HTTP client pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code, indicating no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes request and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1.0). Malware score of 0 aligns.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; details request flow and security considerations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns. Handles inputs securely.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9). Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1 - 0.2), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal security risk, mainly due to standard network operations, which are typical for an HTTP client.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure implementation of an HTTP client with authentication support. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If you have any specific concerns or need further deep-dive into particular sections, let me know!",
