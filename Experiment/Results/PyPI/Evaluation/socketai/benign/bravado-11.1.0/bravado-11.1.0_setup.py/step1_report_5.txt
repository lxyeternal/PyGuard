{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the 'bravado' Python library, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory to load 'README.rst' for long description; imports 'bravado' to access its version; reads dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits untrusted data; no network or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A - setup script does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Uses standard setup procedures, no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party dependencies, configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It dynamically reads the long description from a local file and references 'bravado.version' for versioning, indicating reliance on the 'bravado' package's internal data. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependencies appear typical for a Python package. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging a library, with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks detected. It is a standard distribution configuration file.",
