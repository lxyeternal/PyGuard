{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bravado' Python package, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.rst' file for long description, uses static package data and dependencies specified in lists.",
  "sinks": "No user input, network data, or untrusted data sources present; no data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with typical package configuration; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', uses 'bravado' to get version info, reads static files, and defines package metadata. There are no code injection points, no dynamic execution of untrusted data, and no network activity or system modifications. All dependencies and data are statically defined, and there are no obfuscation techniques or hidden code sections. The only file read operation is for 'README.rst', which is a common practice. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for package distribution.",
