{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bravado' Python package, used to configure and install package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package description from 'README.rst', retrieves package version from 'bravado.version', and loads dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'open' to read README file content, which is safe. No sinks for untrusted data or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static package metadata and dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code primarily involves package setup routines and dependency management.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, including reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All code appears typical for a Python package setup file, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or sensitive information handling occurs. The only file I/O involves reading a static README file. No network calls, credential handling, or data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
