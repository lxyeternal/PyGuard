  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- No dynamic or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n- The only file read is 'README.rst', which is common and benign.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed and are standard packages.\n- The script imports 'bravado' to access its version, which is typical.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- **Malware presence:** All reports assign malware score 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign obfuscated score 0, consistent with the code.\n\n### Potential issues or points of concern:\n- The only noteworthy point is the reliance on `bravado.version`. If `bravado` is malicious or compromised, this could be a concern. However, in a typical setup, this is just importing the package itself to access its version, which is standard practice.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or secrets.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a typical setup.py script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and safe for package distribution. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
