  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'bravado' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file; imports 'bravado' to access version; static dependencies and metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static data flow: package metadata -> setup configuration; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for a Python package, importing standard modules and 'bravado' to get version info. It reads a static README file, defines dependencies, classifiers, and package data. There are no dynamic inputs, network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. All dependencies are standard, and the version retrieval from 'bravado.version' is a common pattern. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code's structure and content are consistent with safe package distribution practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe for package distribution. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are correctly assigned: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
