  "purpose": "Manage configuration data, perform dynamic class import based on string identifiers, and set request parameters for a Python client.",
  "sources": "Class name strings used in _import_class for dynamic import, especially the 'fully_qualified_class_str' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The getattr(import_module(module_name), class_name) call in _import_class, which executes the import and attribute access based on external input.",
  "flows": "Input source: 'fully_qualified_class_str' string -> import_module(module_name) -> getattr() -> potential execution if class name is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with external strings without explicit whitelisting or validation; no sanitization or restrictions on class strings.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates dynamic class loading via import_module and getattr, which can be exploited if class strings are supplied by untrusted sources. The code includes warnings and checks to ensure imported classes extend a specific base class, reducing risk of arbitrary code execution. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the potential for remote code execution if malicious class strings are used, but this risk can be mitigated with input validation. The malware score is 0, as no malicious payloads are embedded. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is moderate (~0.35), reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic import without validation, but no active malicious behavior is detected. Overall, the code is standard for plugin-like systems, with the main vulnerability being untrusted input for class strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its main security concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if class strings are untrusted. Proper validation or whitelisting of class names is recommended to mitigate this risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.35). The code is safe in static analysis but should be used cautiously with untrusted inputs.",
