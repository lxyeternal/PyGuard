  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its main security concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if class strings are untrusted. Proper validation or whitelisting of class names is recommended to mitigate this risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.35). The code is safe in static analysis but should be used cautiously with untrusted inputs."
