  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines HTTP exception classes, a registration mechanism, and a factory function for error handling. It uses class attributes, response objects, and standard Python idioms. No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, indicating no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1), as the code is standard error handling.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The code is a typical, well-structured HTTP error handling module with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the class hierarchy, registration via metaclass, and the mapping function. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2), but still very low.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code serves as a standard error handling utility, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the purpose, focusing on exception classes, registration, and response handling. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is found.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, minimal.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical implementation for HTTP error management, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights the structured approach, class hierarchy, and response-to-exception mapping. No malicious behaviors are observed.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard and safe, serving as a utility for HTTP error handling.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the registration mechanism, class hierarchy, and safe data handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical, well-structured error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), as expected for a standard error handling module.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.1 — minimal, as this is a utility module with no external network activity or data leaks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented HTTP error handling framework, with no evidence of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**If I were to assign scores independently:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis confirms the reports' assessments and indicates no security concern.",
