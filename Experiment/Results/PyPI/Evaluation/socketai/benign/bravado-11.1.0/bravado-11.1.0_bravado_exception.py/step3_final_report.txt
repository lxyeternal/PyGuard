  "purpose": "Defines HTTP exception classes, registration mechanisms, and a factory function for creating exceptions based on response status codes, facilitating error handling in HTTP client implementations.",
  "sources": "Response objects providing status_code, text, and other response data used during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of exception classes with response data; no external data or untrusted input is directly processed beyond standard attribute access.",
  "flows": "Response objects flow into make_http_exception(), which maps status_code to exception classes and creates exception instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard hierarchy of HTTP error classes with dynamic registration via a metaclass, and a factory function for creating exceptions based on response status codes. It uses response attributes only for encapsulation, with no external network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The exception classes and mapping are typical, and no obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The overall structure and logic are sound, with no logical flaws or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a conventional, well-structured HTTP error handling utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
