{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling HTTP errors based on status codes, including mechanisms for registration and string representation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party modules ('bravado_core.response', 'six'), and internal definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception instantiation and raising via 'make_http_exception' and class constructors; string representations in __str__ methods.",
  "flows": "Input responses (from 'IncomingResponse') are used to determine exception class via status code; exceptions are instantiated and potentially raised or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of HTTP error handling classes with registration mechanisms. It imports necessary modules, defines a metaclass for automatic registration of subclasses based on 'status_code', and provides a factory function 'make_http_exception' to generate appropriate exception instances based on response status codes. The error classes correspond to HTTP status code categories, with specific subclasses for many individual status codes. String methods enhance debugging output. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, typical for an error handling module, and leverages Python standard and third-party libraries appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements standard HTTP error handling with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs class registration, exception creation, and detailed error reporting in a conventional manner, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
