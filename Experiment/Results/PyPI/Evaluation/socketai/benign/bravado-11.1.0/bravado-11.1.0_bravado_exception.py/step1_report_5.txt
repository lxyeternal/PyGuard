{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exceptions for handling HTTP errors and status codes in a Python HTTP client library, including registration and mapping of status codes to exception classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (bravado_core.response, six, builtins, typing). Internal definitions of exception classes and status code mappings. No external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of exception objects with response data. String representation methods that format response information.",
  "flows": "Creation of exception instances from HTTP responses based on status codes, with custom string outputs for error details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Exception handling and class registration follow standard patterns. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code properly handles different Python versions and type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a hierarchy of HTTP error classes, mapping status codes to exception classes, and provides a factory function to generate appropriate exceptions based on HTTP response status. It uses a metaclass to auto-register subclasses with their status codes. No input or output mechanisms interact with untrusted sources; all data used is within response objects. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code execution pathways are present. The string representation methods format response details for debugging. External dependencies are typical for a HTTP client library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of HTTP error handling classes with appropriate registration and mapping. No malicious intent or suspicious behaviors detected. It is a typical part of an HTTP client library with no evident security issues.",
