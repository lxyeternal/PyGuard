{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of custom exceptions for handling HTTP errors, along with mechanisms to register, create, and manage these exceptions, mainly for use in an HTTP client implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (bravado_core.response, six, typing), and internal class and function definitions. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes are instantiated and returned in make_http_exception(). No data leaks, external communications, or dangerous sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Response object is passed into make_http_exception(), which retrieves the status code and maps it to a specific exception class. The exception is then instantiated and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Exception handling is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured exception hierarchy for HTTP errors, including dynamic registration of exception classes based on HTTP status codes. It handles Python 2 and 3 compatibility for certain exceptions, uses a metaclass for automatic registration, and defines specific exception subclasses for each HTTP status code. The make_http_exception() function maps status codes to exception classes, with fallback categories. All parts follow typical design patterns for error handling and are unlikely to be malicious. No external network operations, data leaks, or malicious activities are implemented. The code appears to be a well-structured utility module with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of HTTP error handling classes and does not contain any malicious or sabotage behaviors. It primarily serves as a foundation for error management in HTTP client code, with no suspicious signals.",
