{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions for HTTP error handling, mapping status codes to exception classes, and provides utility functions for raising appropriate exceptions based on HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from bravado_core.response, six, and builtins; uses response objects passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes are instantiated with response data, which could potentially include untrusted response content. The make_http_exception function retrieves exception classes based on response status codes.",
  "flows": "Response object → make_http_exception retrieves or defaults to HTTPError → Exception instance created with response data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls observed. Exception classes are purely data structures for HTTP errors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured approach to handle HTTP errors by defining a hierarchy of exception classes for different HTTP status codes, with a registration mechanism via a metaclass. The make_http_exception function maps response status codes to specific exception classes, defaulting to a generic HTTPError. The code uses standard library imports and relies on response objects for error handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior, external network activity, or code injection patterns are detected. The code appears to be a standard error handling module, focusing on mapping HTTP responses to exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate HTTP error handling module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It provides a clear structure for HTTP error representation and mapping based on status codes. The implementation appears standard and safe.",
