  "purpose": "Define a version string for a software package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only performs a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only notable aspect is the encoding declaration and version string, which are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a file encoding declaration and a single line assigning a version number to a variable. No input/output operations, no external dependencies, no obfuscated or suspicious code. The version string appears to be a normal semantic version number. No indicators of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
