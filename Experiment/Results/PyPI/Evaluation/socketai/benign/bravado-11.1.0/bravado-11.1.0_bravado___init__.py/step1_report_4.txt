  "purpose": "Defines a version string for the module or package.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, outputs, or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only a static variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no unusual patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a single variable assignment setting 'version' to '11.1.0'. There are no inputs, no outputs, no functions, and no control flow. No signs of malicious activity or malicious code constructs. The code appears to serve as a simple version indicator, typical in package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple version declaration with no security concerns. No malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified.",
