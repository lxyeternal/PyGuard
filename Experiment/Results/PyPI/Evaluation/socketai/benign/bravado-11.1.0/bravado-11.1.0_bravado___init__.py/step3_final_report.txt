  "purpose": "This code defines a version string for a Python package, serving as a simple metadata indicator.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a straightforward variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, clear, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a single assignment of a version string to a variable. It does not involve any input/output, external dependencies, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present, and the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
