  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a set of import statements, constants, and an abstract class with unimplemented methods.\n- No data processing, external data handling, or network activity occurs here.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation are present.\n- The class is designed as an interface to be subclassed, not to execute logic directly.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code is purely an interface with no executable logic or data handling. No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Any?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct for its purpose. It uses standard Python conventions and is well-structured.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- Some reports mention the potential for data flows or data handling. However, since this is an interface with no implementation, these are just theoretical possibilities, not actual issues.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the unanimous reports, I agree with the current scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0              |\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard interface declaration with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. It is safe, straightforward, and contains no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security concerns. No changes to scores are necessary.",
