  "purpose": "Define an interface for a minimal HTTP client to retrieve Swagger specifications and perform HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read directly in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present. No external data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from source to sink; the class defines method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is a standard interface definition.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a class 'HttpClient' with an abstract method 'request' intended for subclasses to implement. It includes constants for content types and a simple __repr__ method. No actual data processing, input handling, or network activity is present here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within this module. The code appears to be a typical interface template for HTTP operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains no data handling, external interactions, or security issues. The absence of implementation details limits the analysis, but based on provided code, it is benign.",
