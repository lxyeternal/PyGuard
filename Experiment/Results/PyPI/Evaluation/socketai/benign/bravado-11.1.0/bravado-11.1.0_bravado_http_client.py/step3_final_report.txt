{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for an HTTP client used in Swagger/OpenAPI interactions, specifying request parameters and behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports modules related to Swagger and HTTP handling; constants for content types; class declaration with no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data; it only declares an interface.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class contains only method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, abstract class defining an interface with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. It imports relevant modules, declares constants, and specifies a method to be implemented by subclasses. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. All signals indicate benign, structural code intended for extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. It poses no threat and is safe for use as part of a larger system.",
