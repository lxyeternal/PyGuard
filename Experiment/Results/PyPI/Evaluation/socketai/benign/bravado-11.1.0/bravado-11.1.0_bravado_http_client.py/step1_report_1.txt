  "purpose": "Defines an interface for a minimal HTTP client to retrieve Swagger specifications and perform HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "No input sources are explicitly read within this code; it defines method signatures for future implementation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows or untrusted data paths, as this code only declares an interface with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "This module only contains import statements, constant definitions, and a class with unimplemented method signatures. There are no runtime data reads, no data processing, and no potential for malicious behavior. The class is designed as an interface for future extension, not executing any logic itself. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface declaration without executable logic, data handling, or external data sources. It presents no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. It appears safe and standard.",
