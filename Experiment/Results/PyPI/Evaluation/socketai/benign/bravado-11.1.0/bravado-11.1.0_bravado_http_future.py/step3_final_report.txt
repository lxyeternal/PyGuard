{
  "purpose": "Handles HTTP responses, unmarshalling, validation, and error management within bravado; processes JSON and MessagePack content.",
  "sources": "response.json(), unpackb(response.raw_bytes), response.headers.get('content-type')",
  "sinks": "None evident; response data is processed locally without exfiltration or external influence.",
  "flows": "Response content is retrieved via json() or unpackb(), then validated and unmarshalled; errors are raised or fallback mechanisms invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; standard library functions used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard response handling for an API client, including JSON and MessagePack processing, validation, and error management. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Error handling and fallback strategies are conventional. The response content processing functions are typical for such SDKs. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0.2 are justified given the code's purpose and implementation. Confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an API response handler with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
