{
  "purpose": "The code loads Swagger/OpenAPI specifications from URLs or local files, supporting JSON and YAML formats, with safe YAML loading practices. It facilitates retrieving and parsing API specs for further processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from URLs (via urllib), local files (via os.path and pathname2url), and response objects (response.text, response.headers).",
  "sinks": "Parses response.text with simplejson.loads and yaml.load; potential data leaks if untrusted data is processed without safeguards, but safe loaders are used.",
  "flows": "Input URLs or file paths → request functions or file handlers → response data (JSON/YAML) → parsing functions → output dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses yaml.load with SafeLoader, which is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for URL handling, file I/O, and JSON/YAML parsing. It correctly distinguishes file scheme URIs, uses safe YAML loading, and handles response headers appropriately. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The security measures, such as SafeLoader, mitigate YAML injection risks. The code's structure is straightforward, with clear separation of concerns. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for loading Swagger specifications, with proper safety practices. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
