  "purpose": "Utility function to warn about deprecated API operations based on metadata in op.op_spec.",
  "sources": "Reads 'deprecated', 'x-deprecated-date', 'x-removal-date' from op.op_spec; accesses op.operation_id.",
  "sinks": "Issues warnings via warnings.warn() based on metadata; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata from op.op_spec; constructs warning message; calls warnings.warn().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward metadata check and warning issuance.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if an API operation is marked as deprecated by inspecting op.op_spec. If deprecated, it constructs a warning message including optional deprecation and removal dates and issues it using warnings.warn(). It uses a conditional import to avoid cyclic dependencies. The code performs only benign metadata inspection and warning generation, with no external input processing, network activity, or data manipulation. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The logic is simple, clear, and standard for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for issuing deprecation warnings based on static metadata. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
