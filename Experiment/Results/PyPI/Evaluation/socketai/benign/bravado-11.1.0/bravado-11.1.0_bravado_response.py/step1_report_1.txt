{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for handling HTTP responses and metadata in a Swagger client, including response result, timing, and exception info.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming response data from the 'incoming_response' attribute; accesses response headers and status code; uses monotonic clock for timing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no output or external data transmissions present.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from 'incoming_response' to properties like 'status_code' and 'headers'. Timing info is derived from monotonic timestamps; exception info is stored and checked.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of standard libraries and no obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data structures to manage HTTP response metadata, timing, and exceptions in a Swagger client context. It relies on standard Python modules and third-party libraries like 'monotonic' and 'bravado_core'. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for response metadata handling within an API client. It does not contain malware, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
