{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for handling HTTP responses and metadata in the Bravado library, including response result and timing information.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from IncomingResponse objects passed to BravadoResponseMetadata during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code mainly reads data and exposes properties.",
  "flows": "Data flows from IncomingResponse objects through class properties (status_code, headers) to user-facing attributes; no untrusted data is forwarded elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures with type annotations and properties for response handling, including timing metrics. It does not perform any network communication, data modification, or contain logic that could be exploited maliciously. No suspicious code patterns, secret leaks, or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of response metadata and handling within a client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It safely provides access to response information and timing data without processing untrusted data beyond simple data exposure.",
