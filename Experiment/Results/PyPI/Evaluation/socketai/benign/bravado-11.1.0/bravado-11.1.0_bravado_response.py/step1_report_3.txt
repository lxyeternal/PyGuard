  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling and storing HTTP response metadata and responses for the Bravado library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, class attributes, and constructor parameters (incoming_response, result, metadata, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Accessors for response status code, headers, and properties that expose response data.",
  "flows": "Initialization of response metadata objects with response data; properties accessing response attributes; potential flow from untrusted incoming_response to response data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-safe classes for encapsulating HTTP response data and metadata, with properties for safe access to response details. Usage of 'typing' for type hints, and monotonic timing for performance metrics, aligns with standard practices. No untrusted input processing, network operations, or malicious patterns are present. The imports are for standard and third-party libraries, used in a read-only manner. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of response metadata handling within a client library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
