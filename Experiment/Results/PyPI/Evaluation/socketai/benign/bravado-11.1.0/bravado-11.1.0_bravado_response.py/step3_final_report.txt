{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for handling HTTP response data and metadata in a Swagger client, encapsulating response result, timing, and exception info.",
  "sources": "Response objects (`incoming_response`) and timing functions (`monotonic`) for measuring request durations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing; data flows from response objects to class properties.",
  "flows": "Response data and timing info are stored within class instances; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes with standard Python practices, type hints, and timing measurements. It manages response metadata safely, with no network calls, data leaks, or malicious patterns. The properties and exception handling are straightforward and appropriate. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for response data handling in an API client. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
