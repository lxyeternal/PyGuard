{
  "purpose": "Define classes for handling and encapsulating HTTP response metadata and responses in the Bravado client.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class constructors, property methods, and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data directly; properties access response attributes.",
  "flows": "Input data from IncomingResponse objects flow through class properties and stored attributes, with no external or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code is mainly standard data encapsulation. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data classes with standard property accessors, constructors, and type annotations for managing HTTP response metadata. No user input handling, network calls, or insecure operations are present. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of response data structures for a Swagger client.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical implementation of response metadata management with no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks. It serves its purpose as a data container without performing any dangerous operations.",
