{
  "purpose": "Define classes for handling and metadata for HTTP responses from the Bravado API client, including response result, metadata, and timing information.",
  "sources": "Attributes from incoming_response object, initialization parameters such as incoming_response, swagger_result, timing timestamps, exception info, and request configuration.",
  "sinks": "Access to response status code, headers, and potential exception info; no data sinks that lead to external effects or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Initialization sets internal attributes; incoming_response property accesses private attribute; other properties compute metrics based on stored data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or external network calls detected. The code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions with methods and properties for managing HTTP response metadata and result data. No external input handling beyond object attributes; no data leaks or insecure operations. The code uses standard Python typing, class structures, and timing functions for logging purposes. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured data container for HTTP response metadata and results. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code appears safe and intended for normal operation within an API client context.",
