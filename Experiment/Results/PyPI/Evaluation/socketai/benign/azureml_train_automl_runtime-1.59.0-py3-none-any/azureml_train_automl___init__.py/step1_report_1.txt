  "flows": [
    "imports dependencies -> suppress warnings -> import modules -> setup versioning -> mark package exceptions as loggable -> install logging handler"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "conditional import of AutoMLStep and AutoMLStepRun with try-except without explicit validation",
    "version fallback to '0.0.0+dev' on ImportError",
    "use of __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__) which could be manipulated if __path__ is tampered with"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package initialization, dependency imports, version handling, and logging setup. It suppresses warnings during imports, which is common but can hide relevant issues. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network communications that could be malicious. The use of __import__('pkgutil') and exception handling around imports are standard practices. The call to log_server.install_handler appears to configure logging for the package, not to perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is for package setup and configuration with no apparent malicious behavior. It contains standard patterns for dependency management, version fallback, and logging initialization. There are no suspicious code paths, hardcoded secrets, or external communications. Overall, it appears to be a safe, standard package initialization script.",
