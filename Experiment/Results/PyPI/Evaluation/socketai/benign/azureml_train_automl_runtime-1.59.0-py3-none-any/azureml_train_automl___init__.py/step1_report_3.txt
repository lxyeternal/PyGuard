{
  "purpose": "The code provides a package for Azure Machine Learning automl modules, configuring imports, and setup for logging and versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from system modules (sys, warnings), AzureML libraries, and a local version file (_version).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could cause data leaks or execute untrusted code; logging setup and version import are safe.",
  "flows": "Imports and configuration steps are straightforward and do not involve data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suppressing warnings during import is somewhat unusual but not malicious; dynamic import of version info is typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles module imports, setup for logging, and versioning. It conditionally imports components, suppresses warnings, and marks the module for special logging handling. There are no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code. The only notable aspect is suppressing warnings during import, which is common in package setup but not suspicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package setup code for an Azure ML automl package. No malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity detected.",
