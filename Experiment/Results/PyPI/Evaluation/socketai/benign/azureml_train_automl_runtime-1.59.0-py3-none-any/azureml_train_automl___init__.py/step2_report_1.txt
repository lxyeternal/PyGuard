  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues identified:** Conditional import of `AutoMLStep` and `AutoMLStepRun` with try-except; fallback versioning; use of `__import__('pkgutil')`.\n- **Assessment:** These are standard practices for optional dependencies and package versioning. The use of `__import__('pkgutil')` can be slightly unusual but is common in package extension mechanisms. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, given the package setup nature). The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues identified:** Similar to Report 1, standard import handling, version fallback, suppression of warnings.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The practices are typical for package initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The confidence is high; the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues identified:** Same pattern—warnings suppression, version import, logging setup.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity. The code is standard for package setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues identified:** Importing modules, handling version info, setting up logging.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious indicators. The code is typical for package initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues identified:** Similar import patterns, suppression of warnings, version info import.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The practices are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The reasoning matches the code.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—initialization, import handling, logging setup—nothing malicious is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** The highest assigned is 0.1, which is appropriate given the code's standard package setup functions. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code suppresses warnings during imports, which could hide warnings that might be relevant during debugging, but this is a common practice and not malicious.\n- The dynamic import of version info and fallback is standard.\n- The use of `__import__('pkgutil')` is typical for extending package paths and not suspicious.\n- No external network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection observed.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with the package setup nature)\n- **Overall security assessment:** The code is benign, standard package initialization code with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No changes needed.",
