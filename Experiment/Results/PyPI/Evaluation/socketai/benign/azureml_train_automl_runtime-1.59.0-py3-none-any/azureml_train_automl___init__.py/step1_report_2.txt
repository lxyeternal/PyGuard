{
  "purpose": "This package provides modules for automated machine learning workflows within Azure Machine Learning, including configuration, management, and logging functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (azureml.automl.core and azureml.train.automl), system modules (sys, warnings), and local version files (_version).",
  "sinks": "Logging functions (log_server.install_handler), marking package exceptions as loggable, and dynamic version assignment from local modules.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are registered and used for logging and configuration; no direct data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks to handle import errors, dynamic version import, and suppression of warnings during import are standard; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages imports, versioning, and logging setup for a package intended for Azure ML. It includes standard practices such as import error handling, warning suppression, and registration of logging handlers. There are no indicators of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The dynamic import of version info and suppression of warnings are common in package setup. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup and configuration script for an Azure ML package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
