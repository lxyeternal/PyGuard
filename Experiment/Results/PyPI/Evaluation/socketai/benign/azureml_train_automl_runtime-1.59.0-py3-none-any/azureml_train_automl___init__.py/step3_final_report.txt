  "purpose": "Package containing modules used in automated machine learning, providing resources for configuring, managing pipelines, and examining run output for automated ML experiments.",
  "sources": "Imports from azureml modules, get_sdk_dependencies, log_server, logging_utilities, version info from _version",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or network activity",
  "flows": "Imports and version info are loaded at startup; logging setup configures internal handlers",
  "anomalies": "Suppression of warnings during import; dynamic import of version info; use of __import__('pkgutil') for extending package path",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization: imports dependencies, handles optional dependencies with try-except, suppresses warnings during import, sets version info with fallback, and configures logging. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The suppression of warnings, dynamic version import, and use of __import__ are common practices in package setup. No external network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code are detected. The code is benign and aligns with typical SDK package initialization routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's function.",
