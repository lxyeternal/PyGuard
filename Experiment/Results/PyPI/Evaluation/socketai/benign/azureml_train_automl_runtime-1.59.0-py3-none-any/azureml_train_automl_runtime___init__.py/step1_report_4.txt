  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for automated machine learning pipelines and model explainers, with version handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, especially from internal package files and version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious output.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules and version variables; no data flows to external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Suppresses warnings during import, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly imports internal modules and manages version info. Warning suppression during import is a noteworthy pattern but not inherently malicious. No external network activity, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard library setup code for a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization script with warning suppression and version handling. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
