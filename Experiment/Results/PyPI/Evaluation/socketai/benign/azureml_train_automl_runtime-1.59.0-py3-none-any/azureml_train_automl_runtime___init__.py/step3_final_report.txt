{
  "purpose": "This code manages imports for Azure ML automated ML workflows, handles version info, and suppresses warnings during import, serving as a module setup or interface layer.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version import, warnings.catch_warnings() block",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no external network activity, no data leaks",
  "flows": "Import statements and version handling without external data flow or user input",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.catch_warnings() to suppress warnings during import, which is unusual but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving module imports, version management, and warning suppression. No suspicious patterns, malicious network activity, or data leaks are present. The warning suppression is somewhat unusual but common in package code to reduce log noise. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence level is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code. Overall, the code is a benign setup module with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for Azure ML components with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The warning suppression, while slightly unusual, is not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
