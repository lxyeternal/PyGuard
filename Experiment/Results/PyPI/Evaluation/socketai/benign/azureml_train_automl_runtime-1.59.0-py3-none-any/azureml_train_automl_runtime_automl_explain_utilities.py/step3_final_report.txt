  "purpose": "Utilities for model explanation setup, including data conversion, ONNX model conversion, feature map creation, and explanation configuration within Azure Machine Learning.",
  "sources": "Data inputs such as pandas DataFrames, numpy arrays, scipy sparse matrices, Dataflow objects, and properties from AutoML runs.",
  "sinks": "Internal data transformations; no external network communication, data exfiltration, or side-channel leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through validation, conversion, model transformation (including ONNX), and explanation setup functions, without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code segments identified. Usage of standard SDKs and libraries consistent with legitimate ML utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data handling, model conversion, and explanation configuration tasks. It relies on official SDKs, performs proper validation, and includes error handling. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or sabotage are present. The structure is clear, and the purpose aligns with legitimate model interpretability workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for ML explanation in AzureML. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, risk: 0.0-0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
