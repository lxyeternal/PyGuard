{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for retrieving and explaining machine learning model explanations in Azure Machine Learning, primarily for interpretability and feature importance analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and packages, accesses run objects, and fetches explanations from external AzureML services.",
  "sinks": "Uploads explanations back to AzureML services; does not write or transmit untrusted data externally or store secrets.",
  "flows": "Imports -> fetches run object -> interacts with external AzureML APIs for explanation -> processes data for explanations -> uploads explanations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated functions with warnings, relies on external AzureML SDKs, and does not validate input data explicitly. No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The code handles explanation retrieval and model interpretability, using external AzureML SDKs. No evidence of obfuscated or malicious code, such as hidden network calls or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found. The interactions are limited to AzureML APIs and standard data transformations. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and intended for legitimate model explainability purposes. Use of warnings for deprecated functions suggests ongoing maintenance but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for model explanation in AzureML with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It interacts only with AzureML services and SDKs for legitimate interpretability tasks.",
