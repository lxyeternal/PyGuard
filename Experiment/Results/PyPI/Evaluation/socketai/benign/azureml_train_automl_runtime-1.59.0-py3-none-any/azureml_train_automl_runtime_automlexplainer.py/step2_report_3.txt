  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's role in explanation retrieval and feature importance analysis via AzureML SDKs.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes use of deprecated functions and no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior; interactions are with AzureML SDKs, standard data transformations, and explanation services.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues. **Score adjustments: None needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes explanation retrieval, dataset transformations, and explanation uploads.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions deprecated modules, no suspicious external activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard for explanation workflows, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. **Score adjustments: None needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, describes explanation process, external SDKs, and dataset handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions deprecated warnings, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent or sabotage; interactions are with official SDKs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. These are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with code. **Score adjustments: None needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on explanation workflows, dataset transformations, and explanation uploads.\n- **Anomalies:** Routine use of deprecated warnings, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; primarily explanation data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. **Score adjustments: None needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes explanation functions, data handling, and SDK interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard interpretability code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, external network activity, or backdoors. The code strictly interacts with AzureML SDKs and standard data transformations.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or hidden code patterns detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to deprecated warnings and external SDK dependencies, but nothing indicating security threats.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code appears straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to deprecation warnings and reliance on external SDKs, which is typical for such workflows.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate implementation for model explanation in AzureML, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores should reflect a very low security risk and no malicious intent.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed report or further analysis.",
