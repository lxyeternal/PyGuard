{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve and generate explanations for Azure Machine Learning models, aiding interpretability of feature importance in classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "AzureML SDKs (ExplanationClient, interpret_community.mimic), data transformation modules, external run objects, and dataset inputs.",
  "sinks": "Uploads explanation artifacts back to AzureML run history via ExplanationClient, and processes datasets for explanation.",
  "flows": "Retrieves explanations from AzureML SDK, transforms datasets, generates explanations, and uploads explanations to AzureML run objects.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated SDK modules and functions; no hardcoded secrets, network calls outside SDKs, or suspicious external activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model explanation workflows leveraging AzureML SDKs and interpretability packages. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration behaviors are present. Use of deprecated functions indicates maintenance but not malicious intent. Data transformations and explanation uploads are routine. No obfuscation or suspicious external calls are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, intended for model interpretability, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low risk scores are justified, and malware score remains at 0. The code is clear, well-structured, and interacts only with trusted SDKs and packages.",
