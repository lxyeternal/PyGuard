  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Explains model interpretability via AzureML SDKs; fetches explanations from external services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uploads explanations back; uses AzureML APIs.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses deprecated functions, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or external exfiltration. Interactions are standard for interpretability.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code appears clear.\n- Risk: 0.2 — low, as it interacts with AzureML SDKs for legitimate purposes.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Retrieves explanations via ExplanationClient; processes datasets.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uploads explanations; interacts with AzureML run objects.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses deprecated modules; no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard explanation workflows, no signs of malicious activity or data leaks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.\n- Risk: 0.2 — low, typical SDK usage.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar explanation workflows; interacts with AzureML SDKs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uploads explanations; logs outputs.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses deprecated warnings; no suspicious external activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine interpretability code, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.\n- Risk: 0.1 — minimal, standard SDK interactions.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Explanation functions for Azure AutoML models; manages explanation data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uploads explanations; handles datasets.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses deprecated modules; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard interpretability code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.\n- Risk: 0.2 — low, typical SDK use.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Retrieves and explains models; uses AzureML SDKs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uploads explanations; handles datasets.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine explanation code, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.\n- Risk: 0.1 — low, standard SDK interaction.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports are 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, matching the clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** All low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern given the nature of the code, which interacts only with AzureML SDKs and external interpretability packages for legitimate purposes.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and well-understood.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very low; typical for code interacting solely with cloud SDKs for interpretability.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is legitimate, well-maintained, and poses no security threat based on static analysis.",
