{
  "purpose": "Manage automated ML runs in Azure Machine Learning, including starting, stopping, monitoring, and retrieving outputs.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from azureml and standard libraries; class and method definitions; usage of constants and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network communication, database access, or file writing observed within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "The code defines class inheritance and a method that raises an exception; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is a deprecated method that raises an exception directing users to manual cleanup. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, class inheritance, constant definitions, and a single method that raises an exception. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The deprecated method's purpose is informational, and it does not execute harmful actions. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a part of Azure ML SDK for managing ML runs. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable aspect is a deprecated method raising an exception, which is benign. Overall, the code appears safe.",
