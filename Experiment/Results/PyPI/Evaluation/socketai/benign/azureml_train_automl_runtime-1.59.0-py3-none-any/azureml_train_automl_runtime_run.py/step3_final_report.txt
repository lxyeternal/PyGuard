  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass of Azure ML's AutoML run class, adding a deprecated method to clear cache, which raises an exception with an informational message.",
  "sources": "Imports from azureml SDK modules, class inheritance, and the deprecated method that raises an exception.",
  "sinks": "The deprecated method raises an exception; no data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The method call flows from user invocation to the exception raising; no external data flow or network activity is involved.",
  "anomalies": "The method 'clean_preprocessor_cache' is deprecated and raises an exception with a message; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an Azure ML SDK class with a straightforward deprecated method that raises an exception, serving as a warning for manual cache cleanup. No untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is standard SDK extension, with no obfuscation or security issues. The exception is informational and does not execute harmful actions. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK extension with a deprecated method raising an exception. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
