  "purpose": "Manage automated ML runs in Azure Machine Learning, including starting, stopping, monitoring, and retrieving models.",
  "sources": "Imports from azureml modules, class method that raises an exception",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or external command execution",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; mainly class inheritance and exception raising",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated method with explicit documentation, no suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass AutoMLRun extending an Azure ML class, adding a deprecated method with a clear warning. Imports are standard for Azure ML SDK. The method raises a CacheException with a descriptive message about manual cache management, which is not malicious but indicates deprecation handling. No untrusted data handling, external command execution, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated or malicious code segments detected. The overall structure and imports are typical for an SDK module.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward extension of Azure ML SDK with no malicious intent. It includes a deprecated method with a clear warning and standard imports. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
