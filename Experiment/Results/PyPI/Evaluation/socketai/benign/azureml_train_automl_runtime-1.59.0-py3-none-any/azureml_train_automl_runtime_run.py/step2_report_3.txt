  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a subclass `AutoMLRun` extending an Azure ML SDK class `_AutoMLRun`.\n- It introduces a deprecated method `clean_preprocessor_cache` that raises a `CacheException` with an informational message.\n- Imports are standard for Azure ML SDK modules.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or external command execution is present.\n- The method raising an exception is clearly marked as deprecated and instructs manual cleanup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code itself is straightforward and matches the description.\n- The deprecated method raises an exception with a clear message, indicating intentional deprecation and manual intervention.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or untrusted data handling.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only notable issue is the use of a deprecated method that raises an exception, which could potentially break existing workflows if called inadvertently. However, this is explicitly documented, so it's not an unintentional flaw.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Code is clear, standard SDK extension, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score (0.1):** Very low; the only concern is that the deprecated method raises an exception, which could cause runtime errors if used. But it's documented and not malicious.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is standard SDK extension with no malicious intent.\n- The raising of an exception in a deprecated method is benign and does not pose a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (due to potential runtime impact if deprecated method is called, but no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard Azure ML SDK extension with a deprecated method that raises an exception. No malicious activity, no suspicious patterns, and no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, considering the method could cause runtime errors if used, but it is not a security concern.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the code appears safe and benign.",
