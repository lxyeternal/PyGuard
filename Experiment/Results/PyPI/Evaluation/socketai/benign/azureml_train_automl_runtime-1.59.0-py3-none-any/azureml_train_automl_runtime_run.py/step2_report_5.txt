  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily SDK management code, importing standard Azure ML modules.\n- The only notable feature is the deprecated method `clean_preprocessor_cache`, which raises a `CacheException` with an explanatory message. This is clearly documented and intended for administrative purposes.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, data exfiltration, or external command execution is observed.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code segments are present.\n- The code's structure and purpose align with typical SDK extension patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The reported issues (use of deprecated method, no malicious code, standard imports) are accurate.\n- The code does not contain any logic that would execute untrusted input or perform malicious actions.\n- The raising of an exception in the deprecated method is benign and clearly documented.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any actual flaws or security issues in the code.\n- The scores assigned to malware (0) and obfuscated code (0) are appropriate.\n- The security risk scores (0.1) seem to be based on the deprecation warning, which is minimal.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- The **malware score** is correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there is no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The **security risk score** is 0.1, reflecting the deprecation warning and exception raising, which is minimal and benign.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The low risk scores are justified because the code is standard SDK management code with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The deprecated method raising an exception is a safe way to inform users about deprecation, not an attack vector.\n\n### Any assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly assume that the code is part of an SDK and does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, related to deprecation warning, not a security concern)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all details, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is standard, well-documented, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect a very low security concern, consistent with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign SDK extension with a deprecated method that raises an exception as intended. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors are present. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as such.",
