  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code extends an Azure ML SDK class (`_AutoMLRun`) with a subclass `AutoMLRun`.\n- It introduces a deprecated method `clean_preprocessor_cache()` that raises a `CacheException` with a message instructing manual cache cleanup.\n- The code primarily involves imports, class inheritance, and a method that raises an exception.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present.\n- The method's purpose is administrative, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues reported present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the description: it mainly manages ML runs, with a deprecated method raising an exception. No malicious or suspicious code is evident.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The only notable flaw is the use of a deprecated method, but this is explicitly documented and not a security concern.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0 and low security risks (~0.1), which aligns with the code's benign nature. The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, so risk scores should remain low.\n\n- **Malware score?**  \n  Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments recognize the code as administrative, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The deprecated method raises an exception with a clear message, which is a benign way to handle deprecation.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- No external data flows or untrusted input handling.\n- The imports and class extension are standard SDK practices.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious behavior, a risk score of 0.1 seems appropriate, perhaps slightly lower, but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard Azure ML SDK extension with a deprecated method for cache management.\n- No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, given the deprecation warning and no malicious code)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and benign.",
