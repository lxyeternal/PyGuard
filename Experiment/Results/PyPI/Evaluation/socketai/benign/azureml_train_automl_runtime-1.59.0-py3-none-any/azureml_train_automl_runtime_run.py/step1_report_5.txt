{
  "purpose": "Manage automated ML runs in Azure Machine Learning, including starting, stopping, monitoring, and retrieving models.",
  "sources": "Imports from azureml modules, including data context, run status, exceptions, and constants; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No code that writes data to external locations or executes untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow identified. Imports set context; class methods do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable feature is the deprecation warning in the method 'clean_preprocessor_cache', which does not execute code but raises an exception. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, imports, constants, and a single method that raises a CacheException with an informational message. The method is deprecated and does not perform any malicious activity. No network operations, data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The imports are standard for AzureML SDK usage. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK management code with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It simply manages ML run artifacts and provides a deprecated method that raises an exception with an informational message. No security risks are detected.",
