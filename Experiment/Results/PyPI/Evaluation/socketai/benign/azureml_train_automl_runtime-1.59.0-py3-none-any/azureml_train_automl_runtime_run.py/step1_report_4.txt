  "purpose": "Manage automated ML runs in Azure Machine Learning, including starting, stopping, monitoring, and retrieving models.",
  "sources": "Import statements from azureml modules, class and method definitions, and constant declarations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; code primarily handles internal data and API interactions.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; no external data handling or user input flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "The method 'clean_preprocessor_cache' raises a CacheException with a static message, indicating deprecation but not malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Azure ML SDK modules and defines a subclass for managing ML runs. The class provides an interface for run management and includes a deprecated method for cache cleanup that only raises an exception. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious patterns are evident. The structure appears standard for a SDK wrapper or extension, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK extension for Azure ML, with no malicious behavior detected. The deprecated method properly raises an exception rather than executing harmful code. Overall, it appears safe, with no security risks or malware signals.",
