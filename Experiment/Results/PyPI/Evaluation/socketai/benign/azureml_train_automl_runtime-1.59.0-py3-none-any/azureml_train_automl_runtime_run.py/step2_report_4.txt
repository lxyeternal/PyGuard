  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a subclass `AutoMLRun` extending an Azure ML SDK class, with a single deprecated method `clean_preprocessor_cache` that raises a `CacheException`.\n- The code primarily involves imports, class inheritance, and a method that raises an exception with a clear message.\n- No evidence of data flow from untrusted sources, network activity, external command execution, or data exfiltration.\n- The deprecated method's purpose is administrative, warning users about cache management, not malicious activity.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard SDK extension with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The `CacheException` raised in the deprecated method is informational, instructing manual cache cleanup—no malicious behavior.\n- The import statements are standard for Azure ML SDK modules.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or data manipulation that could be exploited.\n- The high confidence (0.9) in the reports aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal operational risk due to deprecation notices but no actual security threat.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that raising an exception is benign. Given the context, this is valid.\n- No claims of potential vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is transparent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard extension of Azure ML SDK.\n- No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n- The deprecated method raises an exception as intended, with no harmful effects.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to deprecation warning, but not a security risk)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
