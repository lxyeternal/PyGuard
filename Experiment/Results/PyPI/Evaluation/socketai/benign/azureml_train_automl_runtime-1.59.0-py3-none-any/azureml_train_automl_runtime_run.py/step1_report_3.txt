{
  "purpose": "Manage automated machine learning runs in Azure Machine Learning, including starting, stopping, monitoring, and retrieving outputs.",
  "sources": "Imports from azureml modules, class and method definitions, and a deprecated cache cleaning method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data transmission or file writing occurs explicitly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the deprecated method `clean_preprocessor_cache` which raises a `CacheException` with a message explaining manual cache deletion. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is standard for managing ML runs, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class `AutoMLRun` extending a base class, with a method that raises an exception indicating deprecated cache management functionality. It imports various modules related to Azure ML, but no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The deprecated method's purpose is administrative, not malicious. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, legitimate component for managing Azure ML experiments. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The only notable feature is a deprecated method that instructs users to manually handle cache artifacts. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
