  "purpose": "Provides methods to set and log dataset and problem-related information during an Azure Machine Learning AutoML run, including data statistics, sampling, and time series details.",
  "sources": "Reads input data (X, y), transformed data context, run ID, and optional configuration flags.",
  "sinks": "Logs data info and problem configuration properties to AzureML run properties.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into logging functions; problem info is compiled into a dictionary, serialized, and stored in the run properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. Use of standard AzureML SDK functions for logging and data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden network activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data profiling and metadata logging within an Azure ML AutoML context. It uses typical SDK functions to log data characteristics and properties, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The functions are straightforward, and all data handling is performed through well-known SDK methods and standard Python libraries. There are no suspicious data flows, no network communications, or hidden behaviors. The code’s purpose aligns with typical machine learning pipeline operations, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate part of an AzureML AutoML setup, intended for logging dataset and problem configuration info. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The overall security risk is low.",
