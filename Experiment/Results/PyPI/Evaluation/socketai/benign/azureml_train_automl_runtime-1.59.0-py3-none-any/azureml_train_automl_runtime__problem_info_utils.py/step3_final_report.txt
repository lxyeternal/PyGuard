{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather and log dataset metadata such as shape, class distribution, time series info, and other dataset characteristics into an AzureML run for experiment tracking and profiling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data shapes, class labels, and time series parameters from the provided datasets and transformed data context.",
  "sinks": "The data is logged into AzureML run properties, which are stored in the AzureML backend; no external data exfiltration or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset inputs and transformed data context into the logging functions, which then set properties on the current AzureML run object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard data profiling and logging operations.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy) and AzureML SDK functions to extract dataset shape, class counts, sparse status, and time series metadata. It recommends subsampling based on dataset size, and logs this information along with dataset features, samples, and categorical info into the run properties. No dynamic code execution, network calls beyond SDK functions, or malicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is data profiling and experiment tracking, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dataset profiling utility within an AzureML pipeline. It performs no malicious actions, contains no obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the overall security posture is safe for production use.",
