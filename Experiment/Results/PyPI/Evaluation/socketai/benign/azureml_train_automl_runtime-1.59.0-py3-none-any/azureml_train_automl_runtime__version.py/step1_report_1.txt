  "purpose": "Assign version strings to variables, likely for version comparison or display purposes.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources; static assignment of version strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, with identical version strings assigned; no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns fixed version strings to variables named 'ver' and 'selfver'. No external input, no dynamic or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no data leaks, no network activities, and no sensitive information handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is simple version assignment code with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, serving as version identifiers without any malicious behavior.",
