  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version strings to variables 'ver' and 'selfver'. There are no functions, data input/output, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to simply set version identifiers, which is common in Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define version information with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
