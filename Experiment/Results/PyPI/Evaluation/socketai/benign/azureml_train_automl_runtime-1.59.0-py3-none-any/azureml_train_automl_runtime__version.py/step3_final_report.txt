  "purpose": "Assign version strings to variables for version identification.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to 'ver' and 'selfver'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from static strings to variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns fixed version strings to variables without any dynamic input, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature justify zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores, with high confidence in benignity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving as version identifiers with no security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
