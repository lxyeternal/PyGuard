{
  "purpose": "Assigning version strings to variables, likely for version comparison or validation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual behavior, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string values to variables 'ver' and 'selfver'. There are no inputs, outputs, or processing that could lead to security issues. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. This appears to be standard version variable assignment, common in software versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static version string assignments with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
