  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Azure ML TabularDatasets, including validation, type inference, sorting, and conversion to Dask DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset partition keys, key values, and dataset attributes; uses random sampling for partition selection.",
  "sinks": "Converts datasets to pandas and Dask DataFrames; no external data transmission or credential handling.",
  "flows": "Dataset partition key values are used to select datasets; datasets are converted via delayed functions into Dask DataFrames.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; use of 'random.sample' for sampling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dataset validation, type inference, sorting, and conversion tasks. It employs 'random.sample' for sampling partitions, which is typical for load balancing or testing. No network activity, credential handling, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are straightforward, leveraging well-known libraries and SDKs. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The code's purpose is benign, and the logic is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for dataset management in Azure ML, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of 'random.sample' is justified and does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
