  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package namespace purposes",
  "sources": "The line '__path__ = __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and path extension; common in namespace packages, but could potentially hide malicious intent if misused",
  "analysis": "The code reassigns __path__ by extending it with 'pkgutil.extend_path', a standard practice for namespace packages. No hardcoded credentials, external communications, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and adheres to common namespace package conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace package pattern used to support modular extensions and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
