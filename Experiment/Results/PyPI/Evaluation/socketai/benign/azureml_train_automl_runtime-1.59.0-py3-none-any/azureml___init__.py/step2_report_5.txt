  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code pattern: dynamically importing 'pkgutil' and extending the '__path__' variable for namespace package support.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and widely used in Python packaging.\n- No untrusted data sources, external communications, or data flows are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Issue-by-issue review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard namespace package support, with no malicious activity.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. Same reasoning as above.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The security risk is minimal (0.1), which is acceptable given the code's benign nature. The confidence is slightly below 1, but given the code's simplicity, this is reasonable.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- The code snippets are all standard namespace package support patterns.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero.\n- The security risk scores are correctly low or zero.\n- The confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and commonality of the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain at 0 or very close to it, as the code is benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, safe pattern used in Python packaging.",
