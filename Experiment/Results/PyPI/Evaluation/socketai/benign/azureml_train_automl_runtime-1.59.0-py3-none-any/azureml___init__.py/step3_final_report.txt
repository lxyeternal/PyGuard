  "purpose": "Extend __path__ for namespace package support to enable modular package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'pkgutil' dynamically.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend __path__ -> namespace package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a minimal, standard pattern with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a common pattern used in Python namespace packages, involving dynamic import of 'pkgutil' and extending '__path__'. It does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or communicate externally. The pattern is well-known and widely used, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension pattern with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
