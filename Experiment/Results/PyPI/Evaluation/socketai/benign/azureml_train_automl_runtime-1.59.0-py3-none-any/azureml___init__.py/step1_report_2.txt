  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ variable for namespace package support using pkgutil",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is only extending a namespace package path",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; standard namespace package extension pattern, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically and calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ variable, which is used for namespace packages. This pattern is standard for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activity. The code is minimal, with no external input handling or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical pattern for supporting namespace packages and shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a benign, standard package setup statement.",
