  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for module discovery across multiple locations",
  "sources": "The assignment of __path__ using __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "The extension of __path__ is a local operation without external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard package initialization pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path to modify __path__, which is common in namespace packages. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions are present. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup snippet, with no signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization code for namespace extension, with no malicious activity or security issues detected.",
