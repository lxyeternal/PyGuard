{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's search path to include additional locations, typically for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' but does not process untrusted data or send data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply extends the package's __path__ attribute using 'pkgutil.extend_path', which is a standard practice for namespace packages. It does not perform any data input/output, network activity, or code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. This pattern is common in well-established Python package structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
