{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package compatibility and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify '__path__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical for package modules; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies the '__path__' variable by extending it with 'extend_path'. This is a standard pattern used in Python packaging to support namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, or suspicious operations. The code is concise and appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to package management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard practice for namespace package support, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
