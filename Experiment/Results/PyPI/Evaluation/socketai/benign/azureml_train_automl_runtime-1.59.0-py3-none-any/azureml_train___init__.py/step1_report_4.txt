{
  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ variable for package resource discovery, typically used in namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' on __path__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The import of 'pkgutil' leads to calling 'extend_path' which modifies __path__, but does not involve external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, uses standard library functions, and contains no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' module, which is a standard Python library, and extends the __path__ attribute of the current package, which is common in namespace package implementations. There are no data inputs, no external network calls, no suspicious behavior, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The code is concise and adheres to normal Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for namespace packages and contains no malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
