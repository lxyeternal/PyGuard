  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ attribute for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' on __path__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing with untrusted input present.",
  "flows": "The import of 'pkgutil' and extension of __path__ without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__path__' modification is standard for namespace packages; no anomalies or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard namespace package operation by extending __path__ with pkgutil.extend_path. This is a common pattern in Python to support namespace packages across multiple distributions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hidden code, or unusual constructs. No input sources or data flows to untrusted destinations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace package pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
