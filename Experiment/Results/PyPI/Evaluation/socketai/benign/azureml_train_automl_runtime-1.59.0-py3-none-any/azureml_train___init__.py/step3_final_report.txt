  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> extend_path applied to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard namespace package pattern with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__ with extend_path, a common pattern in Python namespace packages. No untrusted data, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The pattern is well-known and benign. All reports correctly identify this as standard, safe code with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. No anomalies or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package support pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
