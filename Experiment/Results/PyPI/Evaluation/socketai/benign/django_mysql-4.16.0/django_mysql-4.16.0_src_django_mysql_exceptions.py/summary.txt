  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition for a timeout exception. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability. The only minor concern is the shadowing of a built-in exception, which does not pose a security threat but could cause confusion. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a negligible risk due to potential confusion. Overall, the code is safe and the reports are accurate; no changes are necessary."
