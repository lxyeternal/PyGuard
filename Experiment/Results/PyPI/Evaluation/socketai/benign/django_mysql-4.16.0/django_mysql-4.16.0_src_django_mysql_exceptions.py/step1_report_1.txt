  "purpose": "Defines a custom TimeoutError exception class for signaling database operation timeouts.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as no data handling or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains a class named TimeoutError that shadows the built-in exception, which can cause confusion but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future statement, then declares a custom exception class named TimeoutError. The class is solely a subclass of Exception with a docstring. There is no data handling, input/output, or dynamic execution. Shadowing the built-in TimeoutError might be confusing but does not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply defining a custom exception class with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The shadowing of a built-in exception is a minor concern but not malicious.",
