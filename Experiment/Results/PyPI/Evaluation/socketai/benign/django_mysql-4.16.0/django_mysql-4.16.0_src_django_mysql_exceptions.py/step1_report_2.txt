{
  "purpose": "Define a custom TimeoutError exception class for database operations.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since there are no inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations for forward reference type hints and defines a custom exception class TimeoutError inheriting from Exception. The class has only a docstring and no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues in this minimal implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition intended to represent a timeout exception for database operations. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
