  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for signaling database operation timeouts.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports __future__.annotations for type hinting.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definition contains only a docstring and inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "Shadowing the built-in TimeoutError exception; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations for forward references, then defines a class named TimeoutError inheriting from Exception. The class contains only a docstring and no logic, data handling, or external interactions. Shadowing the built-in TimeoutError is a minor concern but not malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and benign, serving solely as a custom exception. The lack of external data flow or dynamic behavior indicates no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition for a timeout exception. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability. The only minor concern is the shadowing of a built-in exception, which does not pose a security threat but could cause confusion. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a negligible risk due to potential confusion. Overall, the code is safe and the reports are accurate; no changes are necessary.",
