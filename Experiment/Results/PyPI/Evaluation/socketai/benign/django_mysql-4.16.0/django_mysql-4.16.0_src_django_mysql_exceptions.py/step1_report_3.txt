{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for indicating database timeout errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definition without instantiation or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; standard exception subclassing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations for forward reference hints and defines a custom TimeoutError exception class. It is a simple, standard pattern used to create specialized exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials, external communications, or obfuscated code are present. The class is appropriately documented, indicating its purpose related to database operation timeouts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign class definition used for handling specific timeout exceptions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
