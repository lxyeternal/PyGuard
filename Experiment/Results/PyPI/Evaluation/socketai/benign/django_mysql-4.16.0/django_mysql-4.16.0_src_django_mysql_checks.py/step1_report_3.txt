  "purpose": "This code performs database configuration checks related to MySQL connection settings, specifically verifying InnoDB strict mode and character set configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads database connection variables by executing SQL queries to fetch @@innodb_strict_mode and @@character_set_connection.",
  "sinks": "The data read from the database (variables) are used to generate warnings; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "The code fetches database configuration variables (source) and generates warnings based on their values (sink). There are no external data flows or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code performs standard configuration checks without any unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and Django utilities to register and perform database configuration checks. It queries database variables using established Django-MySQL connections, then assesses whether certain settings meet recommended security and compatibility standards. The functions generate warnings if configurations are suboptimal. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden functionality. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard database configuration check utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs legitimate checks and generates warnings based on database settings, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity.",
