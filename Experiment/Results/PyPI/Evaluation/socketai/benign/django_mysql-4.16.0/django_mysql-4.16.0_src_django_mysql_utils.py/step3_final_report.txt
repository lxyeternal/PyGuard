  "purpose": "Utility functions for database interaction, timing, string formatting, index retrieval, and schema analysis within a Django environment.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data, model metadata, database schema, and timing information.",
  "sinks": "Database queries (using cursor.execute), command-line argument construction, data returned to caller.",
  "flows": "Configuration and schema data are used to build queries and command arguments; data flows from inputs to database and output functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting in SQL query construction in get_list_sql and index_name functions; no evidence of hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for Django-based database schema introspection, timing, and command-line argument assembly. Queries are parameterized, mitigating injection risks. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of string formatting in SQL queries is controlled and does not appear to be exploitable given the context. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard utility code with no malicious intent or malware. The low security risk score is appropriate, with a minimal concern about string formatting in SQL queries, which is mitigated by parameterization. The malware score remains zero, and obfuscation is not present.",
