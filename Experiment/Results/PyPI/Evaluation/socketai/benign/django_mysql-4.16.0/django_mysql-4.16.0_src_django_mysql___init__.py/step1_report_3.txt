  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function within a larger application, possibly related to data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input via the console, and possibly from external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file write operations, or execution of dynamically generated code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, user input) to processing functions, and potentially to output destinations such as network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. No suspicious code patterns like dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or obscure control flows are detected. No backdoors or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed for security issues such as hardcoded secrets, unsafe data handling, or malicious behaviors. It uses standard libraries and functions with no signs of obfuscation. Input sources and output sinks are typical for data processing scripts. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code structure is clear and straightforward, indicating normal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code snippet. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
