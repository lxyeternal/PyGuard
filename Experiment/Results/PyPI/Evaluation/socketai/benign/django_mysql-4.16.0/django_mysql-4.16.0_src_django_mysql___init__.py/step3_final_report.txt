  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, obfuscation, and security issues based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, external modules, network connections, and code snippets (if available).",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file system modifications, environment variable access, and data handling points where untrusted data could cause leaks or harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (e.g., network, file system).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network connections, obfuscation patterns, or unusual code constructs. None identified in the provided summaries.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Confidence levels are high where code is present and clear, and lower when code is missing. Malware scores are zero across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern. The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent with the descriptions. The only notable point is the lower confidence in report 5 due to missing code, where a slightly lower risk score (e.g., 0.1) could be justified, but 0.2 remains acceptable. Overall, the assessments are justified and align with the evidence, indicating a benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code dependencies analyzed show no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the provided descriptions. No adjustments are necessary; the dependency appears safe for use.",
