{
  "purpose": "Defines a type alias 'DeconstructResult' for a tuple structure, likely used for data processing or deconstruction.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform output or data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; it only defines a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for compatibility, imports 'Iterable' from 'collections.abc', and 'Any' from 'typing'. It then defines a type alias 'DeconstructResult' as a tuple with specific string, string, iterable, and dictionary components. There are no functions, no data processing, no external input/output, and no dynamic code execution. Overall, it is a straightforward type alias definition without any suspicious or malicious characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias definition for a tuple structure, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as a structural type hint for other parts of a codebase.",
