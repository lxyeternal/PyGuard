{
  "purpose": "Defines a type alias for a tuple representing deconstruction results, likely for use elsewhere in the code.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows since the code only contains type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for forward compatibility, imports Iterable for type annotations, and defines a tuple type alias 'DeconstructResult'. There are no runtime operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be purely declarative and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type alias definition with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies.",
