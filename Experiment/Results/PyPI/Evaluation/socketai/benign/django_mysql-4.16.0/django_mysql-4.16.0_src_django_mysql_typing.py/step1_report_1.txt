  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'DeconstructResult' for a tuple consisting of a string, another string, an iterable of any type, and a dictionary with string keys and any values.",
  "sources": "The code imports from __future__ for compatibility, collections.abc for Iterable, and typing for Any; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since no data processing or input handling is implemented.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and a type alias definition for 'DeconstructResult'. It uses standard Python features and modules with no logic or data processing. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type alias definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears benign and purely structural.",
