  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'DeconstructResult' as a tuple with specific types for use in type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "No runtime data input; only static import statements and type alias definition.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A; code is purely declarative with no execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard imports and a simple type alias.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'annotations' from '__future__' for forward compatibility, imports 'Iterable' from 'collections.abc', and 'Any' from 'typing'. It then defines 'DeconstructResult' as a tuple of four elements: two strings, an iterable of any type, and a dictionary with string keys and any values. There are no runtime operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code serves solely as a static type alias for clarity and type checking, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type alias definition with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
