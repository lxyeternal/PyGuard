{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a tuple representing deconstruction results, including strings, an iterable, and a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Import statements: __future__ import for annotations; collection module for Iterable; typing module for Any.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines a type alias without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations, collections.abc.Iterable, and typing.Any, then defines a type alias 'DeconstructResult' as a tuple with specific types. There is no dynamic execution, no input reading, and no sink operations. It is a static type alias definition intended for type hinting in larger codebases.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type alias definition for documentation and type checking purposes, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
