  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code snippet.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code imports `annotations` from `__future__` for forward compatibility.\n- Imports `Iterable` from `collections.abc`.\n- Imports `Any` from `typing`.\n- Defines a type alias `DeconstructResult` as a tuple: `(str, str, Iterable[Any], dict[str, Any])`.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n- The code is purely declarative, defining a type alias for use elsewhere.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Analysis of Each Report:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward type alias with no malicious or security issues.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n- The obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores are all 0.0, which aligns with the assessment.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- Since there's no actual processing, data flow, or external data, the risk scores should remain at 0.0.\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- No discrepancies are evident; all reports are consistent.\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or suspicious activity, only that the code is a simple type alias.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- Given the code's benign nature, I would maintain the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.0.\n- No further action or investigation is necessary for this snippet.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard type alias definition with no security issues.\n- Scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0.0\n- Obfuscated score: 0.0\n- Risk score: 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.",
