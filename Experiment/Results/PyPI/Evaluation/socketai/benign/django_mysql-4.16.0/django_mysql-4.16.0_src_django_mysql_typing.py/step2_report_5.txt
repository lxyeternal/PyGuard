  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward type alias definition using standard Python modules.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output, or data processing is present.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely structural.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is benign and serves as a type alias.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments of no anomalies, no obfuscation, and no malware are appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0.0\n     - `malware`: 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0.0\n   - These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0.0; thus, no justification needed.\n   - The code is not risky or malicious.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0.0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; all assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Estimations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious intent or activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risk present.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, benign type alias definition with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern. All reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed; the current assessments are appropriate.",
