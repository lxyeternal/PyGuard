  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a type alias definition with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no issues with the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, static, and serves as a type alias for documentation or type checking. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1.0  \n   - obfuscated: 0.0  \n   - malware: 0.0  \n   - securityRisk: 0.0  \n   \n   These are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are zero for malware and security risk, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign malware = 0.0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions and stick to factual analysis. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.0** — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.0** — No security risks present.\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a simple, static type alias definition with no runtime behavior, data flow, or external interactions. It is entirely benign and serves as a type hint for larger codebases. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
