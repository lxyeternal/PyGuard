  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version identifier for a software component, likely used for tracking or compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are detectable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a version string assigned to a variable; no anomalies such as obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a copyright notice and a single version string assignment. It does not include any input handling, network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious or security concern indicators. It appears to be a standard header or metadata snippet.",
