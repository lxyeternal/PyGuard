  "purpose": "Declare the software version identifier for the package.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a static string to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignment with no data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static variable assignment of a version string ('7.1.0b4') with an accompanying license comment. No inputs, external calls, dynamic code, or obfuscation are present. The version string includes a 'b' indicating a beta release, which is standard. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for version declaration. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are observed. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores accurately reflect its safety profile, and no further action or concern is warranted.",
