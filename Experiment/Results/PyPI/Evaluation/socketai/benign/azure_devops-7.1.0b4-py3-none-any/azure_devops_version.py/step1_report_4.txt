  "purpose": "Define a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignment to VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version string declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment header and a single assignment of a version string to a variable. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data, and no suspicious behavior or code structure. The version string includes a beta release indicator ('b4'), which is typical for pre-release versions, but does not imply malicious intent. The code is minimal, static, and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to declare a version identifier with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
