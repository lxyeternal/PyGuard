  "anomalies": "Minimal code, but the version string contains a 'b' indicating a beta release, which is common and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a static version string to a variable. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activity. The license comment is standard. No malicious or malicious-sounding behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
