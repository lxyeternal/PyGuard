  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code snippets they describe.\n\n1. **Code Content Analysis:**\n   - All reports describe a minimal code snippet: a license comment and a single assignment `VERSION = \"7.1.0b4\"`.\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The version string includes a 'b' indicating a beta release, which is standard and not suspicious.\n   - No obfuscation, code execution, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious activity.\n   - The reasoning is consistent: static assignment, no data handling, no external dependencies, and no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is evident.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Misjudgments:**\n   - No report suggests any hidden or malicious intent.\n   - The code is standard for version declaration in open source projects.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the evidence, I concur with the provided scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's simplicity.",
