  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a single line of code assigning a version string to a variable (`VERSION = \"7.1.0b4\"`).\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, external data handling, or code execution.\n   - The code is static, minimal, and contains only a license comment and a variable assignment.\n   - The version string includes a 'b' indicating a beta release, which is standard and not suspicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behavior.\n   - No external network calls, secrets, or data leaks.\n   - No dynamic code, eval statements, or code injection mechanisms.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence score is 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Issues:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - No report suggests any reason to raise the malware or risk scores.\n   - The code's simplicity and clarity support the benign conclusion.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code fragment is a standard version declaration, common in software projects.\n   - There are no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n   - The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the information, I concur with the existing scores. The code is entirely benign, and no additional concerns are warranted.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a straightforward version string declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scoring accurately reflects its safety profile.",
