      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated set of data models for API serialization, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be lowered to reflect the minimal security concern. The malware score remains correctly at 0, and obfuscation is absent. Overall, the code is safe and benign."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure DevOps SDK client with debugging options that could be exploited if environment security is lax. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects potential misuse of debugging features, but overall, the code is safe for intended use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK client with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The security risk score is slightly above zero (around 0.1–0.2) due to environment variable tracing, which is standard but should be handled carefully to avoid log exposure. Overall, the supply chain security posture is very strong, with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation."
