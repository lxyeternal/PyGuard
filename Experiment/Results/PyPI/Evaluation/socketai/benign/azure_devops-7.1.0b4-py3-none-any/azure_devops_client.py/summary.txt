  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK client with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The security risk score is slightly above zero (around 0.1–0.2) due to environment variable tracing, which is standard but should be handled carefully to avoid log exposure. Overall, the supply chain security posture is very strong, with no indications of malicious behavior or obfuscation."
