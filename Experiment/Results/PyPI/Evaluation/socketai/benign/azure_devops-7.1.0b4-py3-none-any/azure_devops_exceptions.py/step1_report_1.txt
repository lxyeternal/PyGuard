{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Azure DevOps client errors, authentication errors, request errors, and service errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from msrest.exceptions; usage of exception objects and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, exception attributes such as message, inner_exception, error_code, etc., could leak sensitive information if logged improperly.",
  "flows": "Exception wrapping flows: wrapped_exception's attributes are used to initialize the custom exceptions, propagating potential sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The exception class hierarchy and constructor are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from msrest.exceptions, mainly for structured error handling in Azure DevOps integrations. The constructor of AzureDevOpsServiceError wraps and preserves inner exceptions, copying relevant attributes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The code appears standard and safe, intended for exception management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for Azure DevOps client errors. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The primary concern is proper handling and logging of exception data to prevent sensitive information leaks.",
