  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Azure DevOps interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing exception classes from msrest.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as this code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports exception classes and defines subclasses for specific error handling in Azure DevOps context. The class AzureDevOpsServiceError includes a constructor that wraps an exception, recursively creating inner_exception instances if present. The code uses straightforward inheritance and exception handling patterns with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present. Overall, this is standard error handling code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical set of custom exception class definitions for an Azure DevOps SDK or client, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
