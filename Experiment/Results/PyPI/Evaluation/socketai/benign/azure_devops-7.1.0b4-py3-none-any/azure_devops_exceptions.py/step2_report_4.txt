  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling Azure DevOps errors, inheriting from msrest.exceptions.\n- The constructor of `AzureDevOpsServiceError` wraps an existing exception, copying its attributes and recursively wrapping inner exceptions.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the code appears standard for error handling.\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is consistent given the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward, and the analysis confirms no issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the code as standard exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The recursive wrapping of inner exceptions in `AzureDevOpsServiceError` is a common pattern for preserving exception chains.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present.  \n- The exception attributes are simply propagated, with no suspicious data handling.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n\n- **Malware score (0):**  \n  Correct, no malicious code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  Correct, no obfuscation observed.\n\n- **Risk score (0):**  \n  Appropriate, no security issues identified.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No changes needed in the scoring or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' evaluations are accurate and well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
