{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Azure DevOps client errors, handling specific error types and wrapping underlying exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'msrest.exceptions' module, usage of wrapped_exception parameter in class constructor.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Imported exception classes are used as base classes; wrapped_exception is used to initialize internal state without any untrusted input flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; standard exception subclassing and property assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception subclasses for error handling within Azure DevOps client context, including nested exception wrapping. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The wrapping of inner exceptions is a common pattern for error propagation. No code injection, external data handling, or obfuscated logic is present. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for Azure DevOps SDK errors. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues. It simply manages exception hierarchy and propagation.",
