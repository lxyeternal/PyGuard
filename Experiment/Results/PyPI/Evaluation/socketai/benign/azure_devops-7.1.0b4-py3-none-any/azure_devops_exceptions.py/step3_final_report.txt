  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Azure DevOps error handling, wrapping underlying msrest.exceptions and preserving exception details.",
  "sources": "Exception instantiation with wrapped_exception and its attributes",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or network",
  "flows": "Exception attributes copied from wrapped_exception to new exception instances",
  "anomalies": "Recursive wrapping of inner_exception could lead to deep recursion if chain is long, but this is standard practice",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from msrest.exceptions, with a constructor that wraps an existing exception and copies its attributes, including recursive inner_exception wrapping. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The exception handling pattern is standard and safe. The code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. The potential concern about exception attribute leakage is a general best practice issue, not a vulnerability. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring aligns with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
