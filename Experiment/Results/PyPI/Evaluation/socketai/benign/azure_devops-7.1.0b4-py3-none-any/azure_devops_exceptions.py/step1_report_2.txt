  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Azure DevOps client errors, handling specific error types and wrapping underlying exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exception classes from msrest.exceptions, usage of wrapped_exception parameter in class constructor.",
  "sinks": "Super constructor call passing message and inner_exception, attribute assignments from wrapped_exception.",
  "flows": "Imported exception classes → Custom exception class definitions → Wrapping and re-raising exceptions with additional properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements. No external network or data manipulation. The code is straightforward exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception subclasses related to Azure DevOps client errors, including an error wrapper that preserves exception chaining and additional properties. There are no input/output sources, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no suspicious logic or code injection. The design is standard for error handling, with no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The wrapping of exceptions and inheritance follows normal patterns, with no unusual code structures or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a clear purpose of structured exception handling for Azure DevOps client errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, with high confidence in this assessment.",
