{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Azure DevOps client errors, handling various specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Imports from msrest.exceptions; input data is the wrapped_exception parameter during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, storage, or transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Wrapped exception data flows into the custom exception's attributes, with no external or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of existing exception classes to represent specific Azure DevOps errors. The constructor of AzureDevOpsServiceError recursively wraps inner exceptions if present, and copies several properties from the wrapped exception. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code appears safe and aligned with typical Python exception handling practices.",
