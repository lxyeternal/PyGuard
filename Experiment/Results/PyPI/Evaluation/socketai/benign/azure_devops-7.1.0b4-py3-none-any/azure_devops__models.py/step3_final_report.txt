  "purpose": "Data models for serialization/deserialization of API resources, exceptions, and telemetry information.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions and initializers; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class instantiation to serialization; no external data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Generated file comment; no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from a serialization base class, with attribute maps for JSON serialization. It contains no data processing, network activity, or input handling. The code is clearly auto-generated, typical for SDKs or API client models. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 to 0.95) are consistent with the benign, structural nature of the code, though some risk scores are overly high given the lack of any security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated set of data models for API serialization, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be lowered to reflect the minimal security concern. The malware score remains correctly at 0, and obfuscation is absent. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
