  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated set of data models for API serialization, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high risk scores in some reports are unjustified and should be lowered to reflect the minimal security concern. The malware score remains correctly at 0, and obfuscation is absent. Overall, the code is safe and benign."
