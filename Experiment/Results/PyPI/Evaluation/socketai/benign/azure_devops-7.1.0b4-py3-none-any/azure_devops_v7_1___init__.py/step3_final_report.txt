  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency files containing only comments and licensing information to determine potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Comments, licensing headers, autogenerated warnings within the files.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no executable code or data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data or code flows exist due to the files' content being solely comments and headers.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; files are purely comments and licensing info.",
  "analysis": "The files contain only comments, licensing headers, and autogenerated notices with no executable code, data input/output, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these files, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The content aligns with typical autogenerated header files, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are present. The scores are consistent with the content, and no further action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The files are benign, autogenerated headers with no security risks or malicious activity. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
