  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe files that are purely comments, licensing headers, or autogenerated boilerplate.\n- No executable code, data processing, or data input/output is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious activity are identified.\n- The consistent pattern across reports suggests these are benign, generated files typical in SDKs or libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Only comments and licensing info.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** No logical errors; the report correctly identifies the file as non-executable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above; comments only, no code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern, comments only.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Comments only, no executable code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others; no code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence:** None. All reports describe purely comments and licensing headers.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 in all cases; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risk:** Correctly 0; no security issues.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the described content.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n- Given the nature of these files, the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** All reports correctly identify these files as benign, generated headers with no security implications. No further action required.",
