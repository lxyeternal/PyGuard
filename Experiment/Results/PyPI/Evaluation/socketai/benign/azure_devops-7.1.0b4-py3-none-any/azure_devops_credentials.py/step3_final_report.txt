  "purpose": "Import authentication classes from the msrest library for use in SDK or client application setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from the msrest.authentication module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Import statement does not involve data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is a straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement importing three classes from msrest.authentication. All reviews correctly identify that there is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. The code is standard for SDK setup and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
