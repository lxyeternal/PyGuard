  "purpose": "Import authentication classes from the msrest library for use in authentication processes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes from msrest.authentication.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import statement, no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three authentication classes from the msrest.authentication module, which is a standard practice for setting up authentication in Azure SDKs or related Python applications. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code snippet is minimal and appears to be part of a larger application or SDK setup. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet solely imports authentication classes and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks on its own.",
