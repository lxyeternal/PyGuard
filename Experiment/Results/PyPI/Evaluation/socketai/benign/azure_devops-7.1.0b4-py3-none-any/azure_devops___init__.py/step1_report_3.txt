  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license header, likely at the beginning of a source file, indicating the code is copyrighted by Microsoft and licensed under the MIT License.",
  "sources": "The license comment itself; no data input sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing evident in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only license comment; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment contains only a license comment header with no executable code, data processing, or logic. It is a standard practice to include such headers at the beginning of source files. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security issues. Since no code logic or external data handling is present, the likelihood of malicious behavior or security risks is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a license header comment with no executable or data-processing content. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
