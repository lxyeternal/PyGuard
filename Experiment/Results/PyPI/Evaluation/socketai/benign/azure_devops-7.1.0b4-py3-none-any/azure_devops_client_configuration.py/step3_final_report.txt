  "purpose": "Define a client configuration class for an SDK, managing base URL, user agent, and headers.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'base_url' and imported 'VERSION' for user agent string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Input 'base_url' is sanitized and used in superclass initialization; 'VERSION' is used in user agent string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with standard URL handling and user agent setting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of 'Configuration' requiring 'base_url', which is sanitized by removing trailing slashes. It sets a user agent string incorporating the version and initializes an empty headers dictionary. There are no hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code follows standard SDK configuration patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for SDK configuration modules. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
