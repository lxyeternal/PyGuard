  "purpose": "Unit testing suite for LVIS dataset evaluation using COCO API and custom COCOeval_faster class.",
  "sources": "Reads local JSON dataset files, numpy arrays, and loads annotations into COCO objects.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed locally with no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON files -> processes data -> performs evaluation -> asserts results.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured unit test suite for dataset evaluation. It reads local files, loads data into objects, performs evaluation, and asserts expected results. No network activity, no code injection, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior are present. The usage of standard libraries and APIs indicates benign intent. The low malware and obfuscation scores (0) are justified, and the security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal risk due to local file operations. Overall, the code poses no security threat and functions as intended for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign testing suite with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
