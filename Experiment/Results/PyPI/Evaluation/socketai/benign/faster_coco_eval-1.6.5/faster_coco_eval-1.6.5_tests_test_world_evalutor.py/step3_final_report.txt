{
  "purpose": "The code performs evaluation of object detection/segmentation datasets using COCO and LVIS, with multiprocessing to process annotations in parallel.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset annotation JSON files from local disk, loads annotations, and processes them for evaluation.",
  "sinks": "All data remains within local files and in-memory structures; no external network transmission or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Dataset JSON files -> annotation processing -> evaluation via COCOeval_faster -> results stored in in-memory variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads dataset annotations from JSON files, processes them with standard libraries, and evaluates detection metrics using multiprocessing. No network activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious code are present. The multiprocessing is used for parallel evaluation, which is standard practice. The code operates solely on local files and data structures, with no external communication or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dataset evaluation script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It employs standard practices and libraries, and its data flow is confined to local operations. The overall security assessment is very low risk.",
