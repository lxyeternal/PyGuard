{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for evaluating object detection and segmentation models using COCO and LVIS datasets, including multi-process parallel evaluation and result summarization.",
  "sources": "Reads input files from 'dataset' and 'lvis_dataset' directories, loads JSON annotations, and reads environment-dependent paths. Loads JSON data via COCO.load_json method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data modifications or outputs; no network operations, file writes, or sensitive data exposure are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input JSON files to internal data structures, processed through multiprocessing, and results are summarized without external or untrusted data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code features. Usage of standard libraries and predictable flow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dataset loading, data preparation, multiprocessing evaluation, and result summarization. No code injections, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior identified. Use of multiprocessing and data copying appears standard for performance. No hardcoded secrets or hidden functionalities present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears legitimate, intended for dataset evaluation tasks. No malicious behavior or security risks detected based on analysis. The structure and operations are consistent with standard evaluation procedures.",
