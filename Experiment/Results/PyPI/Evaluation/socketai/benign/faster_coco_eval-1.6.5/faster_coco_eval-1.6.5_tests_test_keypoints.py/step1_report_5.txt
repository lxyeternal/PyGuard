  "purpose": "Unit testing framework for COCO keypoints evaluation using both original and faster custom classes.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset JSON files from disk, loads modules, and calls functions for evaluation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leakage or untrusted data processing occurs in the code.",
  "flows": "Loads dataset files -> initializes evaluation objects -> runs evaluation methods -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing routines: importing modules, setting up dataset paths, initializing objects, executing evaluation methods, and printing summaries. It uses parameterized testing to compare different implementations. No external or untrusted data manipulation, code injection, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test script for COCO evaluation classes with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only reads local dataset files, runs evaluation functions, and outputs results.",
