{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for COCO evaluation modules, including custom and original COCO classes",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files for ground truth and detection results; imports from external libraries",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is written or transmitted; no execution of external code from untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON files into COCO objects for evaluation; no malicious source-to-sink flow identified",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The script sets up unit tests for COCO evaluation classes, loading data from JSON files and invoking evaluation methods. It uses standard libraries and checks class behaviors. No indication of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The code does not execute untrusted code or handle sensitive data insecurely. The only potentially sensitive part involves file paths, but they are local and controlled. No suspicious network activity or malware indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit testing script for evaluating COCO metrics. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and poses no security risks. It is safe for use.",
