{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit testing script for evaluating COCO keypoints metrics using the COCO and COCOeval classes, performing dataset loading, evaluation, and result summarization.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files for ground truth and detection results, imports evaluation classes, and uses print statements for output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; outputs evaluation summaries via print statements.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON files -> creates COCO objects -> performs evaluation with COCOeval -> outputs results via print or summarize.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; reliance on external files is typical for testing scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs standard evaluation tasks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. External file dependencies are typical in testing environments and do not indicate malicious intent. The import fallback for pycocotools is standard. No network activity or code injection is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit testing script for COCO evaluation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
