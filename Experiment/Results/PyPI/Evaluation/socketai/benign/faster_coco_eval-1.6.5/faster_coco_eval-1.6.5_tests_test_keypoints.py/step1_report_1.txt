  "purpose": "Unit testing for COCO and COCOeval classes, specifically for keypoints metric evaluation in object detection tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files for ground truth and detection results, imports modules and classes, and reads environment via os.path and file existence checks.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects. Uses print statements for output.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON files -> Performs evaluation -> Prints results -> Asserts correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Usage of standard testing framework and dependencies appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up unit tests using standard libraries and the 'unittest' framework, with conditional imports of 'pycocotools'. It loads JSON files presumed to be datasets, performs evaluation through provided classes, and outputs summaries. The code contains no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or system compromise mechanisms. All actions are typical for a testing script. No anomalies or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing script for object detection evaluation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on well-known libraries and performs controlled file-based operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
