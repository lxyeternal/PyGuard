  "purpose": "Unit testing for Crowdpose evaluation functionality using COCO and COCOeval_faster classes.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files 'example_crowdpose_val.json' and 'example_crowdpose_preds.json' from dataset directory, loads resources via COCO class, and processes data.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON files -> Loads into COCO objects -> Evaluates with COCOeval_faster -> Summarizes results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries and third-party modules appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test setup for evaluating object detection performance metrics. It loads specific JSON files, performs evaluation, and asserts expected metric values. No external network calls, no suspicious data handling, and no unusual or malicious code constructs are present. The import statements and class usage are standard for such testing tasks. The code appears legitimate and aligns with normal testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical unit test script for evaluation metrics, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It securely loads data, performs evaluation, and checks results. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
