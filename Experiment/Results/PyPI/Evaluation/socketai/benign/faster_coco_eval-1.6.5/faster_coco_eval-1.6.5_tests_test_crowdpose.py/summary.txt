  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for COCO evaluation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. External dataset files could pose a risk if maliciously crafted, but that is outside the scope of this review. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal external dependencies. No modifications are necessary."
