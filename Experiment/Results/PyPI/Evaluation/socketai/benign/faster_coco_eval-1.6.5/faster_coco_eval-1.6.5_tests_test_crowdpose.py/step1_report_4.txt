{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the functionality of the 'faster_coco_eval' module, specifically for evaluating crowdpose keypoints using COCO metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files ('example_crowdpose_val.json' and 'example_crowdpose_preds.json') from the 'dataset' directory; loads these files into COCO objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no network or system modification functions are invoked.",
  "flows": "Reads dataset files into COCO objects -> passes results to evaluation functions -> computes and summarizes metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with standard library usage and known external modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical unit test setup that loads JSON files and performs evaluation via imported modules. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, or data exfiltration observed. External library 'faster_coco_eval' is used, but its contents are unknown; however, in this context, its use appears to be for evaluation purposes. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are present. The code structure and usage are standard for a testing script.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical unit test for a COCO evaluation module without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads predefined dataset files, performs evaluation, and outputs metrics, all in a benign manner.",
