  "purpose": "Unit test for evaluating crowd pose estimation metrics using the COCO framework.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files for ground truth and predictions; loads data into COCO objects.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted sinks; data is processed locally without external communication.",
  "flows": "Loads files -> initializes evaluation objects -> performs evaluation -> asserts metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard testing code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python unittest script that loads local dataset files, performs evaluation using the 'faster_coco_eval' module, and asserts the expected metrics. It does not contain network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The reliance on external dataset files could be a vector if maliciously crafted, but this is outside the scope of code review. The external module 'faster_coco_eval' is used for evaluation, but its internal behavior is unknown; however, its usage appears standard. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for COCO evaluation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. External dataset files could pose a risk if maliciously crafted, but that is outside the scope of this review. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal external dependencies. No modifications are necessary.",
