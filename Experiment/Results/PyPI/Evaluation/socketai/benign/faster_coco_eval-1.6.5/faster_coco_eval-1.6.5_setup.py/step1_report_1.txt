{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and compile a Python package named 'faster-coco-eval', including compiling C++ extensions using pybind11 and managing dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, reading version info from version.py, parsing requirements files, and sourcing C++ files for extension modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data. The setup process and file reads are standard. No network, system, or data exfiltration operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reads from files (README.md, version.py, requirements files, C++ source files) for setup configuration and dependency management. No flow from untrusted input to critical functions or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard setup script with no unusual dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Use of print statements for source listing is benign. No suspicious URL or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading project metadata, parsing requirements, configuring C++ extensions, and installing dependencies. All code appears to be straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The only potential concern is the dynamic execution of version.py, but this is a common practice in setup scripts and not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and follows conventional patterns for Python package setup. No network activity, data leakage, or backdoor mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It reads configuration files, compiles extensions, and manages dependencies securely. No malicious or sabotage indicators are present.",
