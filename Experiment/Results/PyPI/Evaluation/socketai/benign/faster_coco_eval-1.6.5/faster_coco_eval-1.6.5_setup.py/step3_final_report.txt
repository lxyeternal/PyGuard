  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package with C++ extensions, performing configuration, dependency parsing, and build setup.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, version.py, requirements files, glob for data files, and source code files for extension modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external network activity; no data leaks or system commands executed with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README, version.py, requirements) and passing data to setup functions; no external or untrusted data influencing critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns; dynamic import of version.py is a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading metadata, parsing dependencies, configuring C++ extensions with platform-specific flags, and invoking setuptools.setup(). No malicious or obfuscated code detected. Dependency parsing from local files and dynamic version loading are standard practices. No network activity or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses negligible security risk and is safe for use.",
