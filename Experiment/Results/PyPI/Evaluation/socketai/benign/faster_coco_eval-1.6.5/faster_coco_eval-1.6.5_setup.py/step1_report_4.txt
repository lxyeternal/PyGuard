{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for building and installing a Python package with C++ extensions, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "File reading (README.md, version.py, requirement files), data directory globbing, and dependency parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified that would process untrusted input directly; no network or system command executions.",
  "flows": "Reading version info and requirements files, then passing dependencies and extension sources into the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code involves standard package setup procedures. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. All dependencies are parsed from local files, which could be manipulated externally but are typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading package metadata, parsing requirements, defining C++ extension modules, and calling setuptools.setup(). It uses functions to parse dependencies and read version info. There are no code injection points, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. It includes print statements for debug info about sources but nothing suspicious. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It relies on local files and standard setup procedures without any suspicious logic or hidden backdoors.",
