{
  "purpose": "Unit testing mask encoding/decoding functions with static and random data, ensuring correctness of the implementation.",
  "sources": "Static test data, randomly generated masks, predefined RLE and polygon data within the test suite.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; all data is internally generated or hardcoded.",
  "flows": "Test functions call encoding, decoding, and calculation functions with internal data; no external or untrusted data processed.",
  "anomalies": "Complex 'counts' strings in RLE data appear arbitrary but are consistent with test fixtures; no malicious obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for mask utilities, with static and randomly generated data. No external inputs, network activity, or system modifications are present. The complex 'counts' strings are test fixtures, not malicious payloads. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The scores assigned in the critical reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2—are justified given the benign nature of the code and data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured unit test suite for mask encoding/decoding functionalities. The complex 'counts' strings are test fixtures, not malicious payloads. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
