  "purpose": "Unit testing module for faster_coco_eval, focusing on module import and initialization.",
  "sources": "sys.modules, sys, unittest, faster_coco_eval, faster_coco_eval.core",
  "targets": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present; primarily imports and module manipulations.",
  "flows": "The code initializes module imports and verifies module references; no untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.modules manipulation for module mocking, which is common in tests but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a unit test class that sets up and tears down mocked module states by manipulating sys.modules. It tests whether certain module references are correctly assigned after initialization. The code uses standard unittest practices and does not perform network, file, or environment variable operations. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The module import and mock setup appear legitimate for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely tests module initialization and cleanup procedures typical for testing environments.",
