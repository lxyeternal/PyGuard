  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a unit testing script that manipulates `sys.modules` to verify module import and replacement behavior for `faster_coco_eval` and its submodules.\n- No report indicates any malicious activity, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code's core logic involves standard testing practices: importing modules, setting up mock module references, asserting correctness, and cleaning up.\n- The manipulation of `sys.modules` is typical in testing environments to simulate module replacement or mocking.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The confidence levels across reports are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating consistent observations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code performs **no malicious actions**.\n- It **correctly tests module import behavior** using `sys.modules`.\n- The module manipulations are **standard for testing purposes**.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **No security flaws or errors** are evident.\n- The code **does not introduce vulnerabilities**; it simply manipulates the module cache for testing.\n- The use of `del sys.modules[...]` is acceptable here as cleanup.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (Standard testing code with no security risks)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reports are consistent; all agree that this is benign testing code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n- The module manipulations are controlled and intended for testing, not malicious hijacking.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThis code is a standard, safe unit test for module import behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign test suite verifying module import and replacement logic. It employs common testing practices without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores should reflect this, with all being zero.",
