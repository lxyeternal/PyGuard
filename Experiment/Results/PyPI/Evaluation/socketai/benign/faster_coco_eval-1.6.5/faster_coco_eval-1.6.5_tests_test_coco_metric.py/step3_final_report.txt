{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit testing suite for COCO evaluation metrics, creating dummy datasets and validating evaluation results for both bounding box and segmentation metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from temporary JSON files, numpy arrays, and in-memory data structures; loads results with loadRes method.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; data remains within local files and memory during testing.",
  "flows": "Dummy JSON data and numpy arrays flow into COCO evaluation objects; evaluation results are computed and compared internally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs synthetic datasets and results, performs standard COCO evaluation procedures, and verifies expected metrics. It uses well-known libraries and practices, with no external or malicious interactions. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing suite for COCO evaluation metrics, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
