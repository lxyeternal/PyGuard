{
  "purpose": "A unit testing suite for boundary detection and COCO evaluation metrics, involving mask processing and dataset annotation evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads dataset JSON files, loads annotations, and processes masks via external libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON annotations -> processes masks and segmentations -> evaluates metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dataset loading, mask encoding/decoding, boundary extraction, and evaluation. It uses common libraries and handles dependencies gracefully. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The environment checks for OpenCV availability before running certain tests, which is benign. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical testing routines for segmentation evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward testing suite for boundary detection and COCO evaluation with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
