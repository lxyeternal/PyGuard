{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, files, or function parameters; no external untrusted input sources are clearly identified.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to files, printed to console, or sent over network connections; no use of unsafe eval or exec is detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment, files) through processing functions to output sinks; no suspicious data exfiltration or command execution paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear structure and standard library usage. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication to suspicious domains, data theft, or system modification. The absence of obfuscated code or suspicious function calls further supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a typical utility or data processing script with no malicious features.",
