  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility script with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external files, standard library calls",
  "sinks": "File writes, network connections, system commands, data transmission",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, env vars) to sinks (network, files) without suspicious manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward, with high confidence levels (0.8-0.9). Malware scores are consistently 0, and obfuscation scores are 0. The risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting cautious but justified assessments due to incomplete code snippets in some reports. The reasoning across reports is consistent and justified based on the provided summaries.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is safe with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
