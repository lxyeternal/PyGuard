  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe automation setup for Python development workflows. No malware or obfuscation is present. The only minor security concern is the potential for command injection via unvalidated user inputs, which can be mitigated by input sanitization if necessary. Overall, the code is low risk and well-structured."
