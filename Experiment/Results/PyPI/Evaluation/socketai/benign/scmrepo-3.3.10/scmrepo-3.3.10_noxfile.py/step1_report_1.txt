  "purpose": "Automation of development tasks such as testing, linting, building, and environment setup using nox.",
  "sources": "File system operations (glob.glob, os.path functions), environment variables (env in session.run), user-supplied positional arguments (session.posargs).",
  "sinks": "Execution of external commands via session.run (pytest, pre-commit, python, twine, virtualenv), which could execute untrusted scripts if malicious code is present in inputs or dependencies.",
  "flows": "User provides positional arguments to control sessions, which are passed to external commands. External commands execute scripts or tools that may process untrusted data if input is manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code relies on external tools, but this is standard for such scripts. No suspicious code or backdoors identified. The use of session.install with local packages and external tools appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code automates common development workflows with no suspicious logic. It installs dependencies, runs tests, linters, build tools, and sets up environments. All commands are standard and controlled via predefined configurations and arguments. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The only potential concern is executing external scripts or commands based on user input, but this is standard for such automation scripts. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical automation setup for development workflows. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are detected. It relies on external tools and user input for certain parameters, but these are common and not inherently dangerous in this context.",
