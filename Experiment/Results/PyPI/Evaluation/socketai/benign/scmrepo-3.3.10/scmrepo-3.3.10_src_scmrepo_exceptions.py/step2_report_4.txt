  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code only defines custom exception classes for SCM errors. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no external system interactions, and no embedded code that could be malicious or obfuscated.  \n   - **Confirmed:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**  \n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is purely for error handling, with no suspicious or malicious activity. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with constructors passing formatted messages.  \n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which seems reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - Since the code is only defining exception classes with no external interactions or embedded malicious code, risk scores should remain at 0.  \n   - The reports' scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   - No signs of malware are present; the code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscated logic, or contain malicious payloads.  \n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the actual static analysis of the code.  \n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   - The scores are consistent across all reports, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a clean, standard set of custom exception classes for SCM error handling. It contains no dynamic code, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns. The reports correctly identify this, and their scoring reflects the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
