{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for source control management (SCM) errors, particularly related to Git operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "targets": "No data output, external system interaction, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or input/output paths exist as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions for SCM-related errors, including messages for different error conditions. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The classes contain straightforward constructors and inheritance from the base Exception class. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in SCM contexts. It poses no security risk, malware, or malicious behavior. The code is well-structured, clear, and appears to be purely for error management.",
