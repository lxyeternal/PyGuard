  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for source control management errors.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are for error handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; all classes are straightforward exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception classes related to SCM operations, with no data processing, external communication, or embedded code that could be malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The classes serve as error containers with standard init methods for error messages, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes for SCM error handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
