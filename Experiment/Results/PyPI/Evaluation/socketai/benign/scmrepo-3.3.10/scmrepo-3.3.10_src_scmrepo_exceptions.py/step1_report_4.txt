  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for source control management errors, particularly related to Git operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code only defines exception classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly defines custom exceptions with message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to source control management. Each class extends a base exception class and provides meaningful error messages. No external data input, network communication, or file operations are present. The constructors use parameters to create descriptive messages, but no sensitive data or secrets are embedded. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or code that could perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, safe set of custom exception classes for SCM operations. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or suspicious activities detected. It functions as a utility component for error handling within SCM workflows.",
