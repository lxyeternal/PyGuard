  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes for SCM (Source Control Management) errors, primarily related to Git operations.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The constructors are straightforward, storing parameters and passing formatted messages to the base Exception class.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code appears to be a typical, clean implementation of custom exceptions for error handling.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code only defines exception classes, with no external data handling, no malicious behaviors, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - The analysis in each report correctly identifies that the code is benign, well-structured, and safe.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1.0, indicating high certainty that the code is harmless.\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0 across reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity or code behavior is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified. The code is purely for error handling, with no vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that exception class definitions are harmless, which is generally correct.\n   - There are no claims or evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - No inconsistencies are observed between the code and the scores.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Based on the detailed review, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception classes for SCM error handling with no security concerns.",
