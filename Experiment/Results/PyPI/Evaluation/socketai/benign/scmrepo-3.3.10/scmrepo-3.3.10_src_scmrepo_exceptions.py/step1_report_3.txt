{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for source control management (SCM) errors, mainly related to Git operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The exception classes are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of custom exception classes for SCM errors. Each class either inherits directly from SCMError or adds minimal logic, such as storing URLs or names and passing formatted messages to the base class. There are no input/output operations, network connections, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard pattern for exception handling in a source control context, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions for SCM errors. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors. It simply facilitates error handling within a larger SCM-related application.",
