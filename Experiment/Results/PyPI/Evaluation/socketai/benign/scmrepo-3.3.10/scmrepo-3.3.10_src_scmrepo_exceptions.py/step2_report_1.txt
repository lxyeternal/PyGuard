  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code only defines custom exception classes related to SCM (specifically Git) errors.\n- No input/output, external data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with constructors storing parameters and passing formatted messages to the base Exception class.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1.0 and a malware score of 0, which seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description: it only defines exception classes, with no hidden or malicious behavior.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code logic or structure.\n- The exception classes are standard and well-structured.\n\n**Scores and their appropriateness:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk: 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.\n\n**Potential assumptions or claims:**\n- All reports correctly state that there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on the code content.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level of 1.0 is justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's actual content.",
