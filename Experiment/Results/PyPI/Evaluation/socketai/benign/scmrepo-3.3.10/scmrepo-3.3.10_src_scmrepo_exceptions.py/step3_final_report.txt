  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for SCM (Git) error handling to facilitate error reporting and management within SCM workflows.",
  "sources": "Class constructors accepting parameters such as 'name', 'url', and 'path' to initialize exception instances.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with specific parameters leading to raising or catching these exceptions; no external data flow or malicious payload involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for SCM errors, primarily related to Git operations. It contains no external data handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The constructors store parameters and pass formatted messages to the base Exception class. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The reports uniformly recognize the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code serves as utility error classes for larger SCM workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes for SCM error handling, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
