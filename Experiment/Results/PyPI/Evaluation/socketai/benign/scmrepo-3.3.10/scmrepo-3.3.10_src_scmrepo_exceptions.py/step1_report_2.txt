{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for source control management (SCM) errors, primarily related to Git operations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources read within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code consists solely of exception class definitions with straightforward constructors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for SCM errors, with some constructors storing parameters like 'name', 'url', and 'path' and passing formatted messages to the base class. No data is read from untrusted sources, no execution of dynamic code, and no network or file system interactions are present. The structure is clean, standard Python exception class implementation, and no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is purely for error handling within SCM-related operations.",
