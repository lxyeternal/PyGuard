{
  "purpose": "Parse and report Git progress messages, mapping operation codes to descriptions and invoking a callback with structured progress events.",
  "sources": "Input messages from Git progress output, particularly the 'msg' parameter in __call__ and the static message in __main__.",
  "sinks": "The callback function 'fn' provided to GitProgressReporter, which could potentially process untrusted data if malicious.",
  "flows": "Messages are decoded and passed to '_parse_progress_line', which then triggers the composed function chain leading to 'fn' via 'compose'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard dynamic imports, straightforward function composition, and no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for parsing Git progress updates, with safe usage of dynamic imports and function composition. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. The callback 'fn' is user-supplied and could be malicious if untrusted, but this is a common pattern outside the code's scope. The simulated message in __main__ is static and safe. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
