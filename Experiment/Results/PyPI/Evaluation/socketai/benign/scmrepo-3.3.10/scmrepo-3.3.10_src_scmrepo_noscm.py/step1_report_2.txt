{
  "purpose": "Implement a class representing a NoSCM project that inherits from Base, signaling no source control management.",
  "sources": "os and typing modules, and the imported Base class.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O beyond class initialization.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink involving untrusted data; the class mainly raises exceptions on attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "The class raises exceptions on any attribute access via __getattr__, which might be unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class NoSCM that inherits from Base. It initializes with optional root_dir and exception class parameters. The __getattr__ method raises an exception when any attribute is accessed, signaling that the class is intended to be a stub or placeholder. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. The code's structure and purpose appear straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, non-malicious placeholder implementation indicating a project without source control management. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
