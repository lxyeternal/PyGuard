{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass 'NoSCM' that signals the absence of Source Control Management for a DVC project, raising NotImplementedError for undefined attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os and typing modules; class constructor receiving root_dir parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code primarily raises exceptions and inherits behavior.",
  "flows": "Constructor initializes object; __getattr__ raises stored exception when an undefined attribute is accessed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass inheriting from Base, primarily to signal a specific project state with exception raising on attribute access. No input sources besides standard library imports, and no data flows leading to external systems or sensitive operations. The class structure is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation signaling a project state without any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply inherits from Base and raises exceptions for missing attributes, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
