{
  "purpose": "Implement a class NoSCM indicating absence of Source Control Management for a DVC project",
  "sources": "import os, from typing import Union, from .base import Base, use of __getattr__",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly defines a class with basic behavior",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to raise a stored exception, which is benign; no secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a base class, then defines a class NoSCM inheriting from Base. Its constructor initializes with a root_dir parameter and stores an exception class for later use. The __getattr__ method raises this stored exception when an attribute is accessed, signaling unimplemented or unsupported features. The code is straightforward, with no apparent malicious or suspicious behavior, no external network activity, and no data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign implementation of a class meant to signal the lack of SCM in a DVC project. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
