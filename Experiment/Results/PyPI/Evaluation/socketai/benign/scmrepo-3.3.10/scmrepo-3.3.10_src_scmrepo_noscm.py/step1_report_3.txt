{
  "purpose": "Define a class 'NoSCM' inheriting from 'Base' that signals a project with no SCM control.",
  "sources": "Reading of imported modules and class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from source to sink; primarily class structure and method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local 'Base' class, then defines a 'NoSCM' class that signals lack of source control management. The class constructor sets up an exception type, and __getattr__ raises that exception for any attribute access, indicating a minimal implementation intended for a specific project context. There are no input data sources, external communications, or data handling that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python class patterns without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition with no malicious intent, no external data processing, and no security risks identified. It serves as a marker or stub within a larger codebase.",
