{
  "purpose": "This class serves as a placeholder or marker indicating that the project has no source control management (SCM) system, raising exceptions on attribute access to prevent unintended usage.",
  "sources": "The `__getattr__` method reads attribute access attempts and raises an exception.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Attribute access triggers `__getattr__`, which raises an exception, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The use of `__getattr__` to raise a stored exception (`NotImplementedError`) is unconventional but not malicious; it acts as a signaling mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class `NoSCM` inheriting from `Base`, with a constructor initializing parameters and storing an exception class. The `__getattr__` method raises this exception whenever an attribute is accessed, effectively preventing attribute retrieval. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The pattern is unusual but benign, likely intended as a placeholder or indicator of no SCM. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The exception-raising could cause runtime errors if attributes are accessed unexpectedly, but this is consistent with its signaling purpose. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward placeholder class signaling the absence of SCM, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The exception-raising pattern is unconventional but not malicious. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
