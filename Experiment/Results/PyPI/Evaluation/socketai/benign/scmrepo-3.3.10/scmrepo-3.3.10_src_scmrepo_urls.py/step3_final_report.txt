  "purpose": "Detects SCP-style Git URLs using a regex pattern to identify URLs with optional user info, server hostname, and repository path.",
  "sources": "Input URL string passed to is_scp_style_url function",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs pattern matching without executing or transmitting data",
  "flows": "Input URL -> regex match -> boolean output indicating SCP URL style",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, purpose-specific, and free of obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex pattern to match SCP-style URLs, capturing optional user info, server hostname, and repository path. The function applies this pattern to determine if a URL matches SCP style. The pattern is well-formed, and the function is safe. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is a simple utility for pattern matching, with no external data flows or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-specific, and free of malicious intent or security risks. It performs URL pattern matching without executing or transmitting data. The regex and function are safe and straightforward.",
