  "purpose": "Define a function to identify SCP-style Git URLs using a regex pattern.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'url' passed to is_scp_style_url function.",
  "sinks": "The function performs a regex match on the input URL; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> regex match -> boolean return indicating SCP URL style.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external data fetching or modification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a regex pattern to detect SCP-style Git URLs and a function to match URLs against this pattern. The pattern captures optional user info, server address, and repository path. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. It solely performs pattern matching to identify URL style, which is a benign operation. The code does not process or transmit data, nor does it perform any side-effects or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to detect SCP-style URLs using regex matching. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears safe, clear, and purpose-driven.",
