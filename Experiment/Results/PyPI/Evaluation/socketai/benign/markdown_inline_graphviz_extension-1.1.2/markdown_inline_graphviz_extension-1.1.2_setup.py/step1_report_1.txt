  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and publishing the markdown_inline_graphviz_extension Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via sys.argv, executing system commands with os.system, reading environment state via pip freeze.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls that execute commands like 'pip freeze', 'python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel', 'twine upload dist/*', and 'git tag', which can affect system state and external repositories.",
  "flows": "User runs script with 'publish' argument -> script checks for required tools -> if present, builds and uploads package -> suggests tagging in git.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The os.system commands are standard for packaging workflows but could be misused if someone injects malicious commands. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup and optional publishing steps. It checks for the presence of 'wheel' and 'twine' via pip freeze, then builds distributions and uploads to PyPI if 'publish' argument is given. It also suggests git tagging. All commands are typical for package deployment. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage routines. The script could potentially execute arbitrary commands if sys.argv[-1] is manipulated, but this is standard for CLI scripts. No hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup and publish helper for a Python package. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. It relies on external tools for publishing but does not execute any suspicious commands or hidden routines.",
