  "purpose": "Implementation of cosine similarity algorithms for text and set data comparison",
  "sources": "Input parameters: corpus, string_1, string_2, and documents passed to vectorize and other methods",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal methods for vectorization and similarity computation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. No unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for computing cosine similarity between textual or set data, with methods for vectorization, similarity calculation, and state management. The implementation uses standard mathematical operations and data structures. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code relies solely on internal calculations and data structures, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of cosine similarity algorithms for text and set data, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard, safe utility code without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
