  "purpose": "Implement cosine similarity computations for text or set-based documents, allowing for similarity measurement between strings or collections.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods (__call__, _list), data from __init__ (corpus), and internal attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Returns from __call__ (similarity score), storage of vectors in self.vectors, no external data transmission or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through vectorize and __call__, utilizing internal _list and _hashable methods, with stored vectors for efficiency.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. No network, file system, or external system access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for cosine similarity calculations with different tokenization strategies (text split or set). It processes input corpus to compute document frequencies and then uses these to vectorize documents. The methods are standard mathematical implementations for cosine similarity. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of internal state and no external system calls indicates a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of cosine similarity algorithms for text and set data. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks in the provided code.",
