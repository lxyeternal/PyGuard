  "purpose": "Implementation of cosine similarity measures for text and set data, used for comparing document similarity.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'corpus', 'field', 'string_1', 'string_2', which are data inputs, typically strings or lists.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or network operations. No file operations, external calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through vectorization and similarity calculations. No external or untrusted data is processed in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as obfuscated parts, hidden behaviors, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward implementation of cosine similarity for text and set data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for cosine similarity calculation with methods for vectorizing documents and computing similarity scores. It uses standard mathematical operations and data structures. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or file operations are present. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels are detected. The logic is consistent with typical cosine similarity implementations, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code. The use of math.log and mathematical operations are standard, and the code does not perform any untrusted input execution or external system interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cosine similarity measures for text and set data with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured library for document similarity calculations.",
