{
  "purpose": "This code implements cosine similarity algorithms for text or set data, enabling similarity measurements between two strings or collections.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the parameters 'corpus', 'field', 'string_1', and 'string_2', which are processed via string splitting or collection handling.",
  "sinks": "The code performs computations only in memory, with no direct data leaks, network operations, or system modifications. No sinks suggest malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through vectorization methods, computing cosine similarity without external calls or untrusted data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code does not perform any file or network operations, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for calculating cosine similarity in different contexts (text and set data). It processes input data by tokenizing strings or handling collections, computes term frequencies, and caches vector norms for efficiency. The methods are straightforward, with no external calls, network operations, or system modifications. No signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or sabotage are observed. The code is well-structured, focused solely on similarity calculations, and uses standard Python math functions. The only potential concern might be reliance on input data format but does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cosine similarity algorithms with no malicious behavior detected. It is purely computational, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
