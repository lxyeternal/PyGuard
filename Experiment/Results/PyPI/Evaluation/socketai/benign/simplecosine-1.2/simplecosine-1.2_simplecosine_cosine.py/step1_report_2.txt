{
  "purpose": "The code implements cosine similarity calculations for text and set data, likely for similarity or clustering tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'corpus' parameter during initialization and from the 'field' parameter in the vectorize method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or perform external network operations; no sinks indicate malicious data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'corpus' and 'field' flows through vectorization and similarity calculations within class methods, with no external data flow or output manipulation beyond return values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of math module functions is standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of cosine similarity for text and set data, with typical methods for vectorization, normalization, and similarity calculation. The class structure is clean and uses standard Python features. No external calls, file I/O, network operations, or environment variable usage are present. The code appears designed solely for similarity computation, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign implementation of cosine similarity algorithms, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a typical utility class with no suspicious features.",
