  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, imports 'setuptools', no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static metadata. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or obfuscated logic. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The URL points to a legitimate GitHub repository. All indicators suggest benign intent and safe operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very close) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
