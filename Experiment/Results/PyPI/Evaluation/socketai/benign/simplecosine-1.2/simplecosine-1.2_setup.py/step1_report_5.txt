{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'simplecosine' Python package, used to configure and install the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input or external data sources at runtime; it primarily uses static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the script only prepares package installation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs standard package setup functions without dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to facilitate package setup. It raises an ImportError if 'setuptools' is missing, which is standard. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, network activity, or code execution from untrusted sources is present. The code follows common practices for Python package distribution with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no indications of security risks. It functions solely to configure and install the package.",
