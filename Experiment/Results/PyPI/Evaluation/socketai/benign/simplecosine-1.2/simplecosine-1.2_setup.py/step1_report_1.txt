{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'simplecosine', including metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools', and the setup() function parameters such as name, url, version, description, packages, install_requires, license, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code only handles package setup and does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations with external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not contain dynamic data flows, only static configuration for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a standard package setup script. It imports only 'setuptools' and defines static metadata. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script ensures 'setuptools' is available, then proceeds to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution. All operations are standard for a Python package setup. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated logic present. The package's URL points to a GitHub repository, which is typical. The code performs no network activity or data processing beyond installation metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies. No suspicious code or malware indicators are present.",
