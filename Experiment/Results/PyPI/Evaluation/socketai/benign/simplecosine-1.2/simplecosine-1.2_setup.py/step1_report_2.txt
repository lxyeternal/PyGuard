  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'simplecosine' Python library.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; package metadata fields such as name, url, version, description, packages, install_requires, license, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no handling of untrusted data or inputs.",
  "flows": "Import statements to setup configuration; package metadata to setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with an import of setuptools, with a fallback error message if not available. It then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution occurs. No obfuscated or malicious code elements are present. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and typical for package distribution.",
