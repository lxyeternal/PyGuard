  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'simplecosine' Python library, including dependency specification and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools', setup() function parameters including URL, package list, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' -> execution of setup() with package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' with a fallback error if unavailable, then calls setup() with typical package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data input is present. The code functions solely to define package distribution parameters.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly specifies dependencies and package metadata without any suspicious logic or data leaks.",
