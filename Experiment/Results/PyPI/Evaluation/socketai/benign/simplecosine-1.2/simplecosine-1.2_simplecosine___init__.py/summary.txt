  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but the use of eval/exec with untrusted data and network interactions in some reports introduces notable security risks. Increasing malware scores for reports 3 and 5 to reflect these risks is justified. Overall, the current assessments are reasonable, with slight adjustments to better align with observed behaviors."
