{
  "purpose": "The code serves as license headers and descriptive documentation for the 'playwright' Python package, providing licensing information and package description without any executable logic.",
  "sources": "License headers, comments, and package description docstrings",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only static comments and documentation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; standard licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code is purely informational, consisting of license headers and descriptive comments with no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, documentation-only nature of the code. High confidence is justified due to the straightforward content. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, containing only licensing and descriptive comments. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
