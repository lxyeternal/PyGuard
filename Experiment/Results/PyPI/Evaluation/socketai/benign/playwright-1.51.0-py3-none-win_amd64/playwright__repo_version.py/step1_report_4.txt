{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, to be used for package version tracking.",
  "sources": "The version string '1.51.0' assigned to __version__ and version; the import statements within the TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "The version string is statically assigned; no dynamic data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard for version management and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version variables for package management, with a conditional import for type checking. The version information is hardcoded and static. No external data inputs, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The code follows standard practices for version declaration and type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
