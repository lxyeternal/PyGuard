  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version tuple variables",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only variable assignments and type checking logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward version metadata",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information for a Python package, including conditional type hints and static version variables. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or external data handling. The code is generated automatically by setuptools_scm, indicating it's intended for version management only. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is simple and standard for package version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, automatically generated version definition script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
