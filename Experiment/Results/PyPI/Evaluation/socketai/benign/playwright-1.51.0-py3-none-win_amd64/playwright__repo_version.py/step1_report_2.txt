  "purpose": "Define and store the version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version-related variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of version strings and tuples to variables; no data flow from external input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version declaration generated by setuptools_scm, which manages package versioning. It conditionally imports typing information for type checking and sets version variables statically. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for version management, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard version declaration code with no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security concerns.",
