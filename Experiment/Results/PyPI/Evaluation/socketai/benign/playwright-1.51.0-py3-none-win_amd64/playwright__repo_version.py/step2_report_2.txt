  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version management script created by setuptools_scm.\n- There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n- The version string and tuple are statically assigned, with no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints is standard practice.\n\n**Confirmation of code issues:**\n\n- The code as provided does not contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious constructs.\n- The version variables are assigned static, hardcoded values.\n- No external data flows or security risks are evident.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, auto-generated, and standard.\n- No errors or flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, indicating certainty.\n- These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n\n- Since the code is purely static, auto-generated version info with no external input or dynamic behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk is 0 for the same reasons.\n\n**Potential points of challenge:**\n\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static code review.\n- No suspicious behavior or hidden backdoors are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malware.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the static analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version declaration module with no security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.",
