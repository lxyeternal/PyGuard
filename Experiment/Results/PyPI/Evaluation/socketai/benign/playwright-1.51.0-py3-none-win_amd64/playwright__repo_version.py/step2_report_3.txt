  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:\n   - The code is an auto-generated version module created by `setuptools_scm`.\n   - It defines version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with static, hardcoded values.\n   - It uses a conditional `TYPE_CHECKING` block for type hints, which is standard practice.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, external data, network calls, or data flows to external systems.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no secrets, no backdoors.\n   - The purpose is solely to define version information.\n   - No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports' Logic and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, auto-generated, and standard.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data leaks, external data flows, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The analysis in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence score of 1.0 is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume that the static, generated code is safe, which is reasonable.\n   - No false positives or negatives are apparent here.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version declaration file with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
