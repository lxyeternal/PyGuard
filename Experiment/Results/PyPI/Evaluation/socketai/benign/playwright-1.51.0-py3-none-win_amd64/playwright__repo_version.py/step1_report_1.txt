  "purpose": "This code is generated by setuptools_scm to define version information for a package.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ and version) and tuple definitions (__version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables; no data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated version module that sets version variables based on package metadata. It uses conditional type hinting to avoid runtime overhead. There are no inputs from external sources, no data leaks, and no dynamic or malicious behavior. The code's purpose is to provide version info, and it does so in a straightforward manner. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard auto-generated version info with no malicious or security risks.",
