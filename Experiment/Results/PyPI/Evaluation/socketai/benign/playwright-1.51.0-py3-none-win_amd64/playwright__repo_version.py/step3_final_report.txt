  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and tuple; conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated version module with static version string and tuple, using standard type hinting practices. It contains no dynamic inputs, external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is solely to define version info, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and auto-generated for version management. No malicious or security concerns are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
