{
  "purpose": "Define a class WebError to encapsulate error information related to a web page, including the event loop, dispatcher fiber, page object, and error details.",
  "sources": "Imports from asyncio, typing, and internal playwright modules; class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; class simply stores and exposes attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard class definition with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a straightforward class 'WebError' with an initializer and two property methods. It simply encapsulates error-related attributes without performing any operations or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, secret handling, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard utility class for error management within the playwright library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign class definition used for error encapsulation. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
