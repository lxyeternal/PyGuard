  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar class: `WebError`.\n- The class is a straightforward data container, encapsulating error-related attributes.\n- The code is simple, importing standard libraries and internal modules, with no external input processing, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external communications are present.\n- All reports confidently rate the code as benign (confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is a standard class with no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None identified. The logic is sound, and the implementation aligns with typical Python class patterns.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk)?**  \n  All are rated 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No reason to adjust these scores.\n\n- **Potential for malicious activity?**  \n  None. The code does not process untrusted data, perform external calls, or execute any dynamic code.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that this code is a benign, utility class with no security implications.\n- The risk scores are appropriate; given the absence of any suspicious or malicious features, scores of 0 are justified.\n- The malware score is also correctly set to 0, as there's no indication of malicious intent or payload.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated code score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Personal estimation:\nConsidering all the reports and the code, I agree with the given scores. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward error encapsulation class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
