{
  "purpose": "Define a WebError class for handling errors related to a web page context within an asyncio environment, primarily for error management in the Playwright automation framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (asyncio, typing) and Playwright internal modules, no external input sources or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, system calls, or network interactions. The class properties merely store and return references to objects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the class is a data container with no processing or external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class for encapsulating error information related to a web page within the Playwright testing framework. It imports standard and internal modules but does not perform any network, file, or system operations. No user input, no external data sources, and no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured class used for error handling in an automation context. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign component of a larger framework.",
