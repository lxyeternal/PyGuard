  "purpose": "Defines a WebError class to encapsulate error information related to a web page context, including associated event loop, dispatcher, page, and error details.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from asyncio and typing, and a helper Error object from playwright._impl._helper.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class simply stores and provides access to passed-in objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be a straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python class that encapsulates error details related to a web page or operation, likely used within a larger framework. It imports standard modules and a helper Error class, and defines properties to access its internal attributes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security issues. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscated or dynamically executed code. No external inputs or untrusted data are processed directly in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a data container for error information within a web automation framework.",
