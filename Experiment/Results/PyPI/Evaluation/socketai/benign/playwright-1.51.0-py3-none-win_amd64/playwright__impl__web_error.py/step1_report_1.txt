  "purpose": "Defines a WebError class to encapsulate error information related to a web page or operation within an asynchronous context.",
  "sources": "Imports from asyncio, typing, and internal playwright modules; class initialization parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of WebError with an event loop, dispatcher, optional page, and error object; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward class implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python class definition that encapsulates error details, utilizing standard libraries and internal modules. No external input processing, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The structure is standard and lacks any suspicious constructs or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves as a data container for error information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
