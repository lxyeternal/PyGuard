{
  "purpose": "Defines a WebError class for handling errors in a web automation context, likely within a larger framework such as Playwright.",
  "sources": "Imports from asyncio, typing, and internal Playwright modules; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations; mainly property accessors.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition with properties to encapsulate error details related to web automation. It imports standard libraries and internal modules, uses type annotations, and sets instance variables in the constructor. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The purpose appears to be error encapsulation, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger framework, focusing solely on error representation without any malicious or suspicious features.",
