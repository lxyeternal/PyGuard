{
  "purpose": "Encapsulates error information related to web automation, including event loop, dispatcher fiber, page object, and error details.",
  "sources": "The class receives data from external sources such as the event loop, dispatcher fiber, page object, and error object during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not perform any external operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the constructor parameters to internal variables, then through property accessors; no external data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data container class 'WebError' with properties for error details. It imports standard and internal modules but does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The class serves as a structured error holder within a larger framework, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All indicators point to benign, well-structured code with appropriate scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility class used for error encapsulation within a web automation framework. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified.",
