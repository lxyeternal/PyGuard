  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign factory pattern used within the Playwright framework for object creation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate, primarily due to the dynamic nature of object creation based on external input, which is common in such patterns but not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose a security threat."
