  "purpose": "Factory function for creating various types of ChannelOwner-derived objects based on the specified type parameter.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: parent (ChannelOwner), type (str), guid (str), initializer (Dict)",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe object creation based on untrusted 'type' input; no direct sinks for data leakage or malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Input 'type' parameter determines which object is created; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual dynamic object creation based on 'type' string; reliance on string matching for object instantiation is common but could be misused if 'type' is manipulated externally.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'DummyObject' and a function 'create_remote_object' that constructs instances of various classes based on the 'type' argument. The function acts as a factory, returning different object types depending on the provided string. The code does not process untrusted input beyond this string comparison, and all classes instantiated are from a well-known set of imported modules related to the Playwright automation library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary code, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The pattern of dynamic object creation is typical for such factory functions and appears benign. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward object factory based on type strings, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate codebase managing browser automation objects. The implementation is standard and not suspicious.",
