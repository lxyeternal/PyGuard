      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate driver launcher used in automation frameworks like Playwright. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the handling of untrusted command-line inputs, which could pose a risk if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is safe in controlled environments, with a moderate security risk if inputs are untrusted."

      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The low security risk reflects the powerful features that could be misused if handled maliciously, but these are standard in automation tools. Overall, it is a safe and well-structured implementation."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for artifact management in a browser automation framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from reliance on external channels, which is inherent to its design but does not indicate malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of file data transmission over a channel. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The only minor concern is the unvalidated 'path' input, which is typical for such utility code but does not imply malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign factory pattern used within the Playwright framework for object creation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate, primarily due to the dynamic nature of object creation based on external input, which is common in such patterns but not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose a security threat."

It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified."
