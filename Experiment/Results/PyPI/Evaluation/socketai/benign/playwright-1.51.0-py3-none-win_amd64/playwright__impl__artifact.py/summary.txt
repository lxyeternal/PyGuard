  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for artifact management in a browser automation framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from reliance on external channels, which is inherent to its design but does not indicate malicious intent."
