{
  "purpose": "This script determines a driver executable and CLI, then runs it with command-line arguments and environment variables, acting as a launcher utility within an automation framework.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (command-line arguments), get_driver_env() (environment variables)",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() (executes external driver with provided args and env)",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] and get_driver_env() -> subprocess.run() -> driver executable",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code; passing untrusted inputs directly to subprocess without validation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that invokes a driver executable with arguments and environment variables. It relies on external functions presumed to be safe. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is the potential for command injection via untrusted command-line inputs, which is a common risk in such scripts. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3), reflecting the untrusted input passing but no active exploitation or malicious payloads. The code's simplicity and reliance on trusted external functions mitigate significant risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate driver launcher used in automation frameworks like Playwright. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the handling of untrusted command-line inputs, which could pose a risk if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is safe in controlled environments, with a moderate security risk if inputs are untrusted.",
