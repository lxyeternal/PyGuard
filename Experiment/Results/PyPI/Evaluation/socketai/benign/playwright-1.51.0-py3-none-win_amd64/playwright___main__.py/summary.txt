  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate driver launcher used in automation frameworks like Playwright. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the handling of untrusted command-line inputs, which could pose a risk if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code is safe in controlled environments, with a moderate security risk if inputs are untrusted."
