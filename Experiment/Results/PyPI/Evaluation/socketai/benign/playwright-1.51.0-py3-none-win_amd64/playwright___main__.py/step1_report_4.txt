{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to execute a driver executable with command-line arguments, likely as part of a larger automation or testing framework using Playwright.",
  "sources": "Input is taken from command-line arguments (sys.argv[1:]) which are passed to the driver executable.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() executes an external driver executable with arguments, which could potentially be untrusted if inputs are not sanitized.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> subprocess.run() -> driver executable execution",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically determines the driver executable and environment variables, and directly runs it with user-supplied arguments without validation or sanitization. No explicit hardcoded secrets, but reliance on external functions and executable paths could be a concern if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions to determine the driver executable path and environment. It then runs this executable with command-line arguments provided by the user. The use of subprocess.run() with unvalidated arguments could pose a risk if the arguments originate from untrusted sources, leading to potential command injection. However, given this appears to be a controlled utility for launching drivers within a framework, the main concern is the passing of untrusted inputs directly to a system command. The script handles KeyboardInterrupt gracefully. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not include obfuscated or malicious code, but the execution of external commands with user input warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for running a driver executable with provided arguments. It does not appear to contain malicious behavior, but it relies on external functions and user input that, if untrusted, could lead to command injection or unintended execution. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present.",
