  "purpose": "To execute a driver executable with command-line arguments and environment variables, likely for automating or controlling a driver process.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments), compute_driver_executable() (local function), get_driver_env() (local function)",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run (executes external process with provided executable and arguments, environment variables)",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> compute_driver_executable() -> subprocess.run -> external driver process",
  "anomalies": "Usage of subprocess.run with external driver executable; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns; functions are imported from a presumably trusted library.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves a driver executable path and command-line interface from compute_driver_executable(), then runs it with provided command-line arguments and environment variables obtained from get_driver_env(). It handles keyboard interruption gracefully by exiting with code 130. The code appears to be a standard way to invoke a driver process, likely for automation purposes. No obfuscated code, malicious data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. Usage of subprocess to run an external driver with environment variables is typical for automation but can be risky if the inputs are untrusted; however, in this context, the inputs come from internal functions, suggesting a controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard driver invocation script for automation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It simply runs a driver executable with supplied arguments and environment variables, with proper handling of interruptions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected.",
