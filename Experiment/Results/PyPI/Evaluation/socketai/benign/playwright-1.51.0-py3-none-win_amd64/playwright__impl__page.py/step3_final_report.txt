{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python-based browser automation framework, providing classes and methods for page interactions, event handling, routing, script evaluation, and network interception, similar to Playwright.",
  "sources": "Inputs include URLs, selectors, file paths, and script contents, used in navigation, script injection, and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network requests, script evaluations, file writes, and event callbacks, which can process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs or external sources into network commands, script evaluations, and file operations via method parameters and event handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of eval-like functions and dynamic routing are standard features, not indicators of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured automation API with event subscriptions, navigation, script execution, and network interception. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The features are typical for such frameworks, with inherent risks if misused, but no evidence of malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and potential for misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The low security risk reflects the powerful features that could be misused if handled maliciously, but these are standard in automation tools. Overall, it is a safe and well-structured implementation.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
