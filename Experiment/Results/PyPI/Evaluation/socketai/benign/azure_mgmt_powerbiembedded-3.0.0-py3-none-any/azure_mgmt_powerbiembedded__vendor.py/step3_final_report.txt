  "sources": "request.content, request.headers, request.url, request.method, request.files",
  "sinks": "HttpRequest object creation, potentially used for network transmission",
  "flows": "Input data from request and files flows into HttpRequest object construction",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTTP request objects from provided request data, handling optional form data. It uses standard SDK patterns with no malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The internal class is for typing purposes only, with no executable or network activity. No security flaws or suspicious behavior are present; the code is generated SDK boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK infrastructure code with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a minimal risk score of 0.1 reflecting the low inherent risk of SDK request handling.",
