{
  "purpose": "The code defines internal classes and utility functions for managing PowerBI Embedded resources, primarily for request handling and serialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from request.content and request.headers, and potentially from request.url.",
  "sinks": "The request object is constructed and modified, notably with set_formdata_body(files). No data is sent over the network directly within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data from request and files are used to construct an HttpRequest object; data flows from request content and files into the request object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be generated boilerplate for SDK internal use.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK utility that constructs HTTP requests from given parameters, with proper handling of form data. It uses type annotations and internal class design. There are no indications of data leakage, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The use of internal classes and the absence of network activity or data exfiltration points suggest no malicious intent. The overall structure is consistent with generated SDK code for Azure services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, generated SDK code for internal request management with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply constructs HTTP requests based on provided data, with no suspicious logic.",
