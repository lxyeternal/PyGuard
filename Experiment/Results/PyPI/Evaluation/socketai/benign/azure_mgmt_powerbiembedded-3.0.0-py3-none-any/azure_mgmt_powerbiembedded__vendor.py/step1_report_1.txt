{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and base class definitions for PowerBI embedded management client interactions, including request conversion and internal typing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the request object in the _convert_request function, including request.content, request.method, request.url, and request.headers.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data flow occurs if untrusted data is included in request.content or files and then sent via HTTP requests, but this is standard for request handling.",
  "flows": "Input data (request content, files) flows into the HttpRequest object created in _convert_request, which is then likely sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activities are present. The code is straightforward and typical for an SDK client setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily boilerplate for a client SDK, defining a utility for request conversion and an internal abstract base class with type annotations. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is detected. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be safe and standard for SDK internal implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard SDK utility module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It handles request preparation and internal class definitions without any suspicious behavior.",
