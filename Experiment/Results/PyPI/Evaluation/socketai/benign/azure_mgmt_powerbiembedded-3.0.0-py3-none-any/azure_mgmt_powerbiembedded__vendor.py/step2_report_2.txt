  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports conclude that the code is standard SDK boilerplate, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n   - The `_convert_request` function constructs an `HttpRequest` object from input data, with optional form data handling. This is typical for SDK request preparation.\n   - The `PowerBIEmbeddedManagementClientMixinABC` class is an internal abstract class used solely for type annotations and internal structure, with no executable logic or network activity.\n   - No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The code appears well-structured, with proper handling of request data and form data.\n   - The use of type annotations and internal classes aligns with standard SDK practices.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), reflecting the consensus that the code is safe.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern is if untrusted data (from `request.content` or `files`) is used to construct HTTP requests. However, this is standard in SDK code, which relies on the caller to supply validated data.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not perform any dangerous operations by itself.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity, minimal security risk, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (standard SDK request handling, minimal risk)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign SDK boilerplate with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
