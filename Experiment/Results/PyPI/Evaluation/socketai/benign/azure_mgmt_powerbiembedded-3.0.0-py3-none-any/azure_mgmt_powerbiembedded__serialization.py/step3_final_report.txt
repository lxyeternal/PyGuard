  "purpose": "Serialization and deserialization utilities for JSON, XML, date/time, and model objects, used in SDKs for data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input streams, HTTP headers, raw data, and model attributes during serialization/deserialization processes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data processed during type conversions, data parsing, or model instantiation; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (streams, headers, raw data) through parsing functions, then into model attributes or output formats, with type conversions via eval() in serialize_basic() and deserialize_basic().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() for primitive type conversions, which is controlled but inherently risky if data_type strings are influenced externally.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard serialization/deserialization logic for JSON, XML, date/time, and models. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. eval() is used in serialize_basic() and deserialize_basic() for converting strings to basic types, which is common in generated SDK code but can be exploited if data_type parameters are manipulated by untrusted sources. The overall behavior is benign, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The risk associated with eval() is controlled but should be replaced with explicit casting functions for enhanced security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, utility-focused serialization/deserialization module with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of eval(), which introduces a moderate risk if data sources are compromised. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and risk is set at 0.2 to reflect this concern.",
