  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, utility-focused serialization/deserialization module with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of eval(), which introduces a moderate risk if data sources are compromised. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and risk is set at 0.2 to reflect this concern."
