  "purpose": "Client mixin for Power BI API, constructing requests, handling responses, and error mapping.",
  "sources": "Request building functions, headers, parameters, URL templates, response deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Response handling, error mapping, deserialization, potential injection points in headers and parameters.",
  "flows": "Build request -> send via pipeline -> receive response -> handle errors or deserialize data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK client implementation for Azure Power BI Embedded Management API. It constructs HTTP requests with configurable headers and parameters, sends them through a pipeline, and processes responses with error handling and deserialization. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code follows typical SDK patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The potential risk stems from untrusted input in headers or parameters, which is inherent to SDKs but does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal inherent risk due to input handling, which is acceptable for SDK code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard SDK client code with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
