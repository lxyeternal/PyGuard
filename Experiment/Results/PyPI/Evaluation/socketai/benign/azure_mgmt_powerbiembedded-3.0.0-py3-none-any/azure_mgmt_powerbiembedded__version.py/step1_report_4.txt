  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single assignment of a version string. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or external data interactions. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are detected. The code appears to be part of a generated SDK or client library, which is common for API interaction modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as metadata for a generated SDK module. No malicious activity, suspicious code, or security risks are identified.",
