  "purpose": "This code appears to be a part of a generated SDK or client library, mainly setting a version string.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of the VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior; no secrets, no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license comment, copyright notice, and a version variable assignment. It is a standard boilerplate snippet for a generated SDK. No external inputs, no data processing, no suspicious code. The code is straightforward and typical of auto-generated client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as metadata for a software component. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
