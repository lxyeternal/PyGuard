{
  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for SDK versioning, indicating the version of the generated library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static assignment of VERSION variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior; typical auto-generated header.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static header containing licensing comments and a single variable assignment for VERSION. It does not perform any input/output, network communication, or data processing. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical of SDK or library metadata files, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a version indicator in an SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
