  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is just a static assignment of a version string, accompanied by licensing comments and metadata. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external data handling. No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads is observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is boilerplate code typical of generated SDKs, with no suspicious patterns or security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. This is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's straightforward nature.\n   - **Security risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of any security issues.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as boilerplate, with no hidden malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThis code is entirely benign, serving as a version indicator in a generated SDK. No security concerns are present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risk. All scores are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
