{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version string for a software component, likely part of a larger generated SDK or library.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the VERSION variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points to untrusted sources identified",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data passing from sources to sinks observed",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual patterns, hardcoded version info is common in SDKs",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a copyright notice, license information, and a variable assignment for VERSION. It is a typical header of a generated SDK file. No input reading, data processing, or external data handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The presence of a version string does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a version indicator within a generated SDK. There are no malicious behaviors or security issues detected.",
