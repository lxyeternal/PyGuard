  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard licensing and metadata comments are present, but no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and a single variable assignment setting a version string. No functions, data processing, or untrusted data handling observed. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues detected. The comments indicate licensing and auto-generation, common in SDKs or client libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple version indicator with no suspicious or malicious activity.",
