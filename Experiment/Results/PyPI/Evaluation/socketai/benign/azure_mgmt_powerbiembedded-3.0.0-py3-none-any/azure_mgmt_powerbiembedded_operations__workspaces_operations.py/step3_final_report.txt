{
  "purpose": "This code constructs and manages REST API requests for listing Power BI workspaces within Azure, handling pagination, error mapping, and response deserialization as part of the Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as resource group name, workspace collection name, subscription ID, and external URL links (next_link) during pagination.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request objects used to send API calls; response objects processed for deserialization and error handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> request construction (including URL, headers, params) -> API call via pipeline -> response deserialization -> pagination handling via next_link.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. URL handling in pagination is proper and secure.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard Azure SDK patterns for request building, pagination, and error handling. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. URL parsing and joining are correctly implemented, minimizing injection or manipulation risks. The deserialization and error mapping are standard, with no signs of data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, generated Azure SDK component for managing Power BI workspaces. It exhibits no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) and zero malware score are justified and accurate.",
