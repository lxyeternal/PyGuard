{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions and classes for managing Power BI workspaces within the Azure SDK, including listing workspaces and building HTTP requests to interact with Azure resources.",
  "sources": "Inputs include function parameters such as resource_group_name, workspace_collection_name, subscription_id, headers, params, and next_link; these are used to build requests and handle responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the HTTP request construction, where untrusted parameters could influence URL or headers, and the response handling, which processes data returned from Azure endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into request building functions, which generate HTTP requests; responses are received and deserialized, with errors handled via mapped exceptions. The 'list' method paginates through results using next links.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are observed. The code appears to be standard SDK implementation for Azure resource management. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTTP GET requests for listing Power BI workspaces, handles pagination via next links, and deserializes responses into models. Error handling uses a predefined map of error codes to exceptions. Usage of standard libraries and SDK components is consistent. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are present. The code does not include any suspicious or unusual logic outside typical SDK request/response workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard part of the Azure SDK for managing Power BI workspaces. It securely constructs requests, handles responses, and manages errors without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected.",
