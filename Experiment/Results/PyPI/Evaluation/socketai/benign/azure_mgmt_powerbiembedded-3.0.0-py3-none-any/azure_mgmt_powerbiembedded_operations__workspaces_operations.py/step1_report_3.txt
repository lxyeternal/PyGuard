{
  "purpose": "This code provides management operations for Power BI embedded workspaces via Azure SDK, enabling listing and retrieving workspace data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as resource_group_name, workspace_collection_name, subscription_id, headers, params, and next_link; URL construction; request serialization.",
  "sinks": "HttpRequest object sending data over network; response handling and error mapping.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> build_list_request() constructs HttpRequest -> list() prepares request -> client pipeline runs -> response deserialized -> returns paged data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. URL construction uses serializer for URL parts. Error handling uses standard Azure exceptions. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious network calls or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs secure HTTP GET requests for listing Power BI workspaces using parameterized URL and headers. It employs proper error handling and deserialization. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity identified. The request flow follows standard Azure SDK patterns. Inputs are passed explicitly; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible. The code appears to be standard SDK implementation for resource listing with safe serialization and deserialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Azure SDK client implementation for listing resources, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is well-structured, uses standard practices, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious patterns.",
