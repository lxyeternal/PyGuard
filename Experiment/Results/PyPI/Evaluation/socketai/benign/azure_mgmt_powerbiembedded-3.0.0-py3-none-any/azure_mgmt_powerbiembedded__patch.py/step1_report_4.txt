  "purpose": "This code provides a template and customization function for an SDK generated by Azure's code generation tool, allowing users to customize behavior as needed.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points; only import statements and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily structural and comments.",
