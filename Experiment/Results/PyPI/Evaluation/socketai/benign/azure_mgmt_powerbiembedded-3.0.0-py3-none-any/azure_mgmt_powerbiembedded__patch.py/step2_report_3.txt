  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n   - The code only contains licensing comments, an import statement (`from typing import List`), a declaration of `__all__`, and a function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring.\n   - There are no data flows, no input/output handling, no network communication, and no dynamic or executable code beyond function definition.\n   - No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Malware Score**:\n   - The reports unanimously assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or harmful.\n\n3. **Obfuscation**:\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Security Risks & Flaws**:\n   - Given the code's purpose as a placeholder or template, it poses no security risks.\n   - No vulnerabilities, insecure patterns, or risky behaviors are present.\n   - The reports' security risk scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign high confidence (1.0 or 1) that the code is benign.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n6. **Any discrepancies or issues?**\n   - No. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code is a standard SDK customization stub with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional Justification**:\n- The code is purely structural, intended for user customization.\n- No external data handling, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- The purpose is explicitly for SDK modification, which is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe current scores are appropriate and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation**: I concur with the existing assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
