{
  "purpose": "Placeholder for customizing generated code, providing a hook (`patch_sdk`) for manual modifications to the SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the `typing` module import and the `__all__` variable definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is mainly structural and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, includes licensing and copyright comments, and contains a function meant for custom modifications. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple, mostly boilerplate module with licensing comments, import statements, an empty `__all__` list, and a single function `patch_sdk`. There are no indications of data handling, external communication, or malicious logic. The `patch_sdk` function is described as a customization hook, which is standard in SDKs for user modifications. No anomalous code, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template or stub intended for user customization within an SDK. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
