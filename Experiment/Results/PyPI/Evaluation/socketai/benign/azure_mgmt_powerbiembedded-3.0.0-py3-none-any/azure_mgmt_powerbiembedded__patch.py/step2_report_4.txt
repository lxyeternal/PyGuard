  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a minimal, boilerplate template primarily consisting of licensing comments, an import statement, an empty `__all__` list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk`. There are no dynamic data flows, external data handling, or executable logic. All reports agree that the code is benign and intended for user customization within an SDK.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. Given the simplicity of the code, this reasoning appears sound. No logical errors or flawed assumptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are reasonable, considering the code's nature. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is a straightforward template with no data handling, external communication, or dynamic execution, there's no justification for a high risk score. The reports' scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature. No malicious activity is suggested or detectable.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly identifying the code as a harmless SDK template.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n  No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and unobfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score**: **0**  \n  Given the benign, static nature of the code, the risk is negligible.\n\n### **Summary**:\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK template meant for user customization. It contains no malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final Recommendation**: No further action needed. The code is safe.",
