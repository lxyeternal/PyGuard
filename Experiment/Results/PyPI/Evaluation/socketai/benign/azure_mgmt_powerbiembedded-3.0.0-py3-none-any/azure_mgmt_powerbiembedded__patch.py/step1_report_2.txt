{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, primarily containing licensing information, import statements, and a placeholder function for patching the SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statement (`from typing import List`), module-level variables (`__all__`), and the `patch_sdk` function definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is used, processed, or could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import and variable declaration to the `patch_sdk` function, which contains only a docstring and no executable or dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is a straightforward template with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, safe template for SDK customization, containing only comments, import statements, a list declaration, and a function with a descriptive docstring. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute untrusted input. The structure is standard and aligns with common SDK customization patterns. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK customizations with no malicious or security concerns.",
