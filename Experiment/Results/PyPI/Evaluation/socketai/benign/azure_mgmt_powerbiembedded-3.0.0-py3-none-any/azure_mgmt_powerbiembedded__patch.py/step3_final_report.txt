{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a placeholder or template for SDK customization, allowing users to implement specific modifications via the 'patch_sdk' function.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from licensing comments and the 'patch_sdk' function docstring; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static definitions and an empty function.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal SDK template with licensing comments, an import statement, an empty '__all__' list, and a 'patch_sdk' function containing only a docstring. It lacks dynamic or external data handling, network activity, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK placeholder with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
