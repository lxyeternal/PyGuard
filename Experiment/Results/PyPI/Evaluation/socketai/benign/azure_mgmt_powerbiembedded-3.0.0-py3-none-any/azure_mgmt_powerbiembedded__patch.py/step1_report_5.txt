  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or scaffold for customizing generated SDK code from Microsoft, providing a placeholder function for modifications.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of function definition and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate comments, licensing information, and an empty function, with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template with no executable logic or data handling. It includes licensing info, import statements, an empty list, and a function intended for custom SDK patching. No variables, data processing, or external interactions are present, making it highly unlikely to contain malicious intent. It is likely part of a larger SDK customization process.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a placeholder for custom SDK modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
