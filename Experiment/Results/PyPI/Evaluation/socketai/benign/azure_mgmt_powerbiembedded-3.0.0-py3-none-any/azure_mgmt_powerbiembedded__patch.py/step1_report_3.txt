  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as a template or stub for customizing generated SDK code, particularly for Azure SDKs, providing a placeholder for future modifications.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read; only standard import statements and a function definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leakage operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code does not handle any data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate and placeholder comments, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal and standard, consisting of a copyright notice, licensing info, documentation, an import statement, an empty list definition, and a single function definition. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations. It appears to be a template or customization point for SDK code, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK customization with no malicious or security risk indications. It does not include any malicious behaviors, sensitive data handling, or obfuscation.",
