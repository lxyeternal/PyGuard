  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal, boilerplate module containing:\n     - Licensing and copyright comments.\n     - An import statement (`from typing import List`).\n     - An empty list `__all__`.\n     - A function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring.\n   - There are no data flows, external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The purpose appears to be a placeholder for SDK customization.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n   - No data is read from untrusted sources.\n   - No data is written to sinks that could leak information.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is intended for user modifications, not for executing malicious code.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently identify the code as a benign, standard SDK template.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n   - The reasoning in each report is sound; the code is straightforward and serves as a placeholder.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the code's benign nature, 0 is appropriate.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern could be if the `patch_sdk()` function were exploited to execute malicious code. However, as it currently stands, it contains only a docstring, and its purpose is for user customization, not execution.\n   - Since the code is a template, its security impact depends on how users implement `patch_sdk()`. But the provided code itself does not introduce any risk.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in the code as provided)\n   \n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, boilerplate SDK customization template with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
