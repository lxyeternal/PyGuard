  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Structure**:\n   - The code is a minimal, boilerplate module containing:\n     - Licensing comments (Microsoft, MIT License)\n     - An import statement (`from typing import List`)\n     - A module-level variable `__all__` (empty list)\n     - A function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring and no executable code\n   - The purpose appears to be providing a template or placeholder for SDK customization.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No dynamic code, external data handling, or network communication.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is a standard customization hook, not indicative of malicious activity.\n   - Licensing comments and structure are typical for SDK templates.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, a standard SDK placeholder, with no malicious intent.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malware or malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and standard.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Flaws**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no assumptions are made beyond the code's visible structure.\n   - The code's purpose as a placeholder is standard practice; no further action needed.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Based on the code and reports, I agree with the current scores:\n  - **Malware**: 0\n  - **Obfuscated**: 0\n  - **Risk**: 0\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest higher scores or concern. The code is a safe, standard SDK template with no malicious or security issues.",
