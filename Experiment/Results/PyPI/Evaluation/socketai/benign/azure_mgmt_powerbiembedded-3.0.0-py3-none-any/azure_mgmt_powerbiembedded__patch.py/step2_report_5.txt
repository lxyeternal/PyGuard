  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, boilerplate or template for SDK customization.\n- The code contains licensing comments, import statements, an `__all__` list, and a `patch_sdk` function with only a docstring.\n- No data handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The reports consistently conclude the code is benign with no security risks.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a benign template; no issues are present.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malware indicators.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The purpose and structure are straightforward and standard.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5 at most.\n- Given the benign nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.5, which is acceptable for minimal placeholder code, but even 0.5 might be slightly high given the complete lack of any risky behavior.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely boilerplate with no data handling, no external communication, and no dynamic or executable code beyond function definitions, the risk score should be **0**.\n- Malware score is correctly **0**.\n- Obfuscated score is **0**.\n- Security risk score is **0**.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as a safe template.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature as a benign SDK customization scaffold.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign template with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
