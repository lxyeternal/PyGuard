  "purpose": "Configuration class for setting up the PowerBIEmbeddedManagementClient with credentials, policies, and parameters.",
  "sources": "Credential parameter, subscription_id parameter, optional kwargs for policies and settings.",
  "sinks": "Credential used to create authentication policy; no data leaks or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Credential input flows into authentication policy; policies configured from trusted modules; no suspicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SDK client configuration with input validation, policy setup, and credential handling. It uses trusted Azure SDK modules and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated code. No external data exfiltration, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The credential is used solely for authentication, following best practices. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with only a minimal and justified security risk score in one report, which is acceptable given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK configuration class with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the scoring is consistent with the code's nature.",
