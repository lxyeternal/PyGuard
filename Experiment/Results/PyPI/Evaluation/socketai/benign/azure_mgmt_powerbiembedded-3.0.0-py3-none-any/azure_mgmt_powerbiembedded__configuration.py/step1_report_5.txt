  "purpose": "Define configuration class for Azure PowerBI Embedded Management Client, setting up policies and credentials.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.core.pipeline, azure.mgmt.core.policies, local _version, and parameters in class constructor.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks identified; configuration attributes are set internally without external untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (credential, subscription_id, kwargs) flow into class constructor, influencing policy setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration class that initializes various policies and credentials for an Azure client. It accepts parameters securely and sets up policies accordingly. No data exfiltration, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only noteworthy aspect is proper handling of credential and subscription parameters. There are no external data flows that could lead to security issues or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, straightforward configuration setup for an Azure SDK client without malicious intent or security risks.",
