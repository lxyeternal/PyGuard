  "purpose": "Define configuration class for PowerBIEmbeddedManagementClient, managing Azure credentials and policies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: credential, subscription_id, and optional kwargs; class attributes; imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink for credential use in authentication_policy; any data passed into policies or used in headers.",
  "flows": "credential and credential_scopes flow into authentication_policy; kwargs influence policies and headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected; standard credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration for an Azure management client, utilizing provided credentials and policies. It verifies non-null parameters, initializes policies with either supplied or default instances, and constructs an authentication policy with credentials and scopes. There is no evidence of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The code relies on standard Azure SDK practices, and no suspicious network or file operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate configuration class for an Azure SDK client with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain threats.",
