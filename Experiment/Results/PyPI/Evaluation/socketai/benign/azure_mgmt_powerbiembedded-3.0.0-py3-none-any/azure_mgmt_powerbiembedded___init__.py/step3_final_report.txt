  "purpose": "SDK module initialization, importing core classes, setting version, and applying optional patches.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_power_bi_embedded_management_client, _version, _patch).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import statements and patch application functions without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from _patch; typical in generated SDK code but could obscure code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated SDK initializer with no network activity, no external input handling, and straightforward structure. The wildcard import from _patch is common in such contexts and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The low risk and malware scores are appropriate, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate SDK setup script with no security concerns. The wildcard import is standard practice in generated SDKs and does not imply malicious behavior. The low risk and malware scores are justified and accurate.",
