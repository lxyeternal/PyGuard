  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward package initializer with no external input, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. Wildcard import is noted but common in generated code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity detected. The low security risk score seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the wildcard import from `_patch`. The report recognizes this as typical in generated SDK code, not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is reasonable. Wildcard import could be a concern in some contexts, but here it is standard. The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, similar setup with a focus on the optional patch import via wildcard. The report notes potential risk but concludes it’s typical SDK boilerplate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Justified. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—module setup, versioning, optional patch import, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No security concerns here.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous, standard SDK initialization code with no malicious indicators.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a standard, generated SDK module initializer.  \n- **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious logic in any report.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk scores:** All are very low (0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The wildcard import from `_patch` is typical in generated SDK code, intended for optional patching or extensions. While wildcard imports can sometimes hide malicious code, in this context, it is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- No external data, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present, reducing the attack surface.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Scores should remain as they are:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (acceptable given the context of SDK setup code)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, given the benign analysis)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, generated SDK initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are reasonable and should be maintained.",
