{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages imports for a Power BI embedded management client SDK, handling versioning and optional patching.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_power_bi_embedded_management_client, _version, _patch), and the version variable",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data or external effects, as it only performs module setup and import operations",
  "flows": "Import statements and patch function calls; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can hide imported entities and obscure code behavior; potential for misused or malicious patches, though no explicit malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and manages optional patches. It handles versioning and conditional import of patch modules. The wildcard import from _patch could conceal potentially malicious or unintended imports, but in this context, it is used for applying optional patches. There are no network connections, data leaks, or code execution based on untrusted input. The code is standard for SDK initialization, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical SDK setup code with safe import practices. Although the wildcard import could hide malicious code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior in the provided snippet. Overall, the code appears safe but could be slightly improved by avoiding wildcard imports for clarity.",
