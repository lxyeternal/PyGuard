{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package module for Power BI Embedded Management, importing classes and version info, and applying optional patches.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module files (_power_bi_embedded_management_client, _version, _patch). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no network or system operations are performed here.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports and sets up internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscated features are present. Usage of wildcard import is noted but is a common pattern in generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical generated module initializer with standard import statements, version assignment, and patch application. The try-except block handles import errors gracefully. No suspicious or malicious logic is observed. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization script generated by a code generator. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
