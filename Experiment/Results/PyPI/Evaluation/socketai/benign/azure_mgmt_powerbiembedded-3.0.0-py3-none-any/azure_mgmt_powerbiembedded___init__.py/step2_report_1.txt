  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing internal modules, setting version info, and applying optional patches. No external inputs, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the wildcard import from `_patch`. The report notes this is common in generated SDK code and not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is reasonable; the wildcard import is standard in such contexts.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard SDK setup code. The only concern is the wildcard import, which could theoretically hide malicious code, but in this context, it's typical.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 remains appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar boilerplate code with no suspicious behavior. The try-except for optional import is standard.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate; the report assigns 0, which is acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard SDK initialization code with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate; the report assigns 0, which is acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0). Given the code's nature, this is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, generated boilerplate with no obfuscation; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low risk (0.1 or 0), which is suitable considering the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, generated boilerplate.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal security risk, mainly due to use of wildcard import, which is common in generated SDKs but could be improved for clarity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, standard SDK setup code with no security concerns.",
