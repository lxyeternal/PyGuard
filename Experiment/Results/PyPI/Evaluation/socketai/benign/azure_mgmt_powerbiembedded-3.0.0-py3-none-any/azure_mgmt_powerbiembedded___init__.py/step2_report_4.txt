  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a generated SDK module initializer for Power BI Embedded Management.\n- It primarily performs imports, version setting, and optional patch application.\n- No external inputs, network operations, or data processing are involved.\n- Wildcard imports from `_patch` are noted but are common in generated SDK code; they do not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, and handles imports and versioning.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minor, just due to the wildcard import, but acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SDK setup with minor concern over wildcard import.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minor, consistent with the previous report.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, with a note on potential risks of wildcard import but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minor concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard auto-generated SDK setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, boilerplate SDK code with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Presence of malware or malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) due to wildcard import concerns are reasonable, but the overall risk remains very low.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores align well with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and generated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minor due to wildcard import but generally safe.\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard SDK initialization boilerplate with no signs of malware or security issues. The minor concern over wildcard import is typical in generated code and does not elevate the security risk meaningfully.",
