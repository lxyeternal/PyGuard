{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated SDK module for Microsoft Power BI Embedded management, setting up imports and patching mechanisms for the SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module version from an imported variable, and attempts to import optional patch components.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network operations, or security-sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules and executing patch functions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious import patterns are present. The code appears to be boilerplate SDK setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Python module for a generated SDK, imports core components, handles optional patch imports gracefully, and invokes a patching function. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious logic. The import statements and version assignment are standard practices. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK setup boilerplate without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It appears to be auto-generated and intended for SDK initialization purposes only.",
