  "purpose": "A boilerplate SDK customization template intended for user modifications and extensions.",
  "sources": "No data input or output; no external data handling; import statement and placeholder function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function `patch_sdk()` is a placeholder with no execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of active code, data processing, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-documented template with licensing comments, an import, an empty list, and a placeholder function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The function `patch_sdk()` is intentionally empty, serving as a customization point. The code does not perform any data handling, network activity, or logic that could introduce vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK customization scaffold with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
