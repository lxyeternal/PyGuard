  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as a boilerplate or template for SDK customization.\n   - No reports identify any data input/output, network activity, or code that could be malicious.\n   - The code contains only licensing comments, a docstring, an import, an empty list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with no implementation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a benign template with no active logic.\n   - No logical flaws or suspicious behavior are present.\n   - The code's purpose is clear: it is meant for user customization, not for executing malicious actions.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - The code is a benign scaffold, with no data handling, no external calls, and no obfuscation.\n   - The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as a non-functional template.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's description and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the code's purpose as a placeholder/template, there's no reason to assign higher scores.\n- The reports are thorough and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a standard, benign SDK customization template with no malicious or security concerns. The current scoring is appropriate.**",
