  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a boilerplate SDK customization template.\n   - There are no signs of data input/output, external data handling, or malicious code.\n   - The code contains only licensing comments, a docstring, an import, an empty list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with no implementation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5 since the code is a straightforward template with no active logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations.\n   - The risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as a non-functional, template scaffold.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless SDK customization scaffold.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate.",
