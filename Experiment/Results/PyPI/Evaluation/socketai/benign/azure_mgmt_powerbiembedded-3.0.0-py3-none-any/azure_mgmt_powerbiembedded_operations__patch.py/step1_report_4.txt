{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically allowing users to patch or modify the SDK behavior if necessary.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the imported modules and the internal comments; no input or external data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, such as data outputs or external network connections, that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns. It is a standard SDK customization template with comments and a placeholder function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward template with licensing information, comments, and a single function `patch_sdk()` intended for future customization. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It does not handle or process data; it simply defines a structure for user customizations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK customization template with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate part of an SDK library setup, meant for user modifications as needed.",
