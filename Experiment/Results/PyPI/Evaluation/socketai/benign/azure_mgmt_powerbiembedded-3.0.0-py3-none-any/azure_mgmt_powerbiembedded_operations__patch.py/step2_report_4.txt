  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard SDK customization template.\n- No data input/output, no data flows, no suspicious code patterns.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The purpose is solely to provide a placeholder for user modifications.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The code consists of licensing comments, a docstring referencing customization, an import statement, an empty list `__all__`, and a single function `patch_sdk()` that contains only a docstring.\n- There are no active code operations, data handling, or external interactions.\n- The function `patch_sdk()` is a placeholder with no implementation.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The analysis correctly states that the code is a boilerplate template for SDK customization.\n- No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in the reports.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- No evidence suggests any security risk, malware, or obfuscation. Therefore, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The reports' scores are justified.\n\n**Malware score:**\n- Correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n- No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a template with no active logic or external data handling.\n- No false positives or unwarranted concerns are present.\n\n**Score consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard SDK customization scaffold with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The code and reports align well with the security assessment.",
