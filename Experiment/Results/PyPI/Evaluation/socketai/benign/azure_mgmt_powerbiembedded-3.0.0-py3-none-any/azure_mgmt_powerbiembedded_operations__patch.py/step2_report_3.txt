  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their findings, scores, and implications:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the code as a simple, boilerplate SDK customization template.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly for user customization, with no inherent security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code or malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate an obfuscated score of 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, consistent with the code's lack of active logic or external interactions.\n- **Confidence levels:** All are 1, reflecting high confidence in the benign assessment.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; no contradictions or suspicious claims are present.\n- The scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- Since the code is purely a template with no data handling or logic, claims of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are unfounded.\n- The reports correctly avoid overestimating risk or malware presence.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign, standard SDK customization template with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's nature.",
