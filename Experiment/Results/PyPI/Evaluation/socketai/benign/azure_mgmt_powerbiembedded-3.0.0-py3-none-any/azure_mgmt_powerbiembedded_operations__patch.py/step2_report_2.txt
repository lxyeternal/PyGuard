  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a boilerplate or template for SDK customization.\n- They consistently identify no data input/output, no suspicious or malicious code, and no obfuscation.\n- The purpose is to provide a structured place for user modifications, with no active logic or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code contains:\n  - Licensing header.\n  - A docstring referencing customization.\n  - An import statement (`from typing import List`).\n  - An empty list `__all__`.\n  - A function `patch_sdk()` with only a docstring and no implementation.\n\n**Security and Malware Assessment:**\n- No data input, output, or processing.\n- No external network calls, data handling, or code injection.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The function `patch_sdk()` is a placeholder, not executing any code.\n- The code is clearly a template meant for user extension, not an active component.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0, because the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1, as all reports agree on benign nature.\n\n**Potential Issues or Challenges:**\n- No issues are present in the code or reports.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is a benign template.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless SDK customization scaffold with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed in scoring.\n- No suspicious elements detected.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
