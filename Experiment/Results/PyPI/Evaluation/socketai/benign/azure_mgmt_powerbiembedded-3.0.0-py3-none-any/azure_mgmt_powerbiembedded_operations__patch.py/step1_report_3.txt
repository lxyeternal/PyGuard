  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or scaffold for customizing generated SDK code, primarily providing documentation, a placeholder list for public API exports, and a function for manual patches.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, data leaks, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only straightforward comments, function definitions, and variable declarations with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and primarily serves as a template for SDK customization. It includes standard licensing comments, a docstring with a URL, an empty list for public API exports, and a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' intended for manual modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code structure is clean and typical for SDK customization templates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK customization template with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
