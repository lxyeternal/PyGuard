{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code, specifically for Azure SDK for Python, allowing users to add custom modifications or patches.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink as the code only defines a placeholder function and an empty list.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard licensing and structural comments, a placeholder function `patch_sdk`, and an empty list `__all__`. No suspicious or unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward template for SDK customization. It imports typing for type hints, defines an empty list for public API exports, and includes a single placeholder function `patch_sdk` intended for user modifications. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template intended for customization of SDK behavior. It contains no malicious activity or security risks. Its purpose is purely to provide a structured place for user-defined patches or extensions.",
