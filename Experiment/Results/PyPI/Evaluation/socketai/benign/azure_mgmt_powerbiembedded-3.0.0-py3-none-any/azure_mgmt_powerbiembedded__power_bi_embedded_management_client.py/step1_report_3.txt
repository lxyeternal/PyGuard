  "purpose": "The code defines a client class for managing Power BI Embedded resources in Azure, including setting up policies, serialization, and network request handling.",
  "sources": "Reading imported modules, class initialization parameters, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "The _send_request method which constructs and sends HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters -> setup policies and client configuration -> _send_request method copying and formatting requests before sending.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or obfuscated code, no backdoors, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard client implementation generated by an API code generator. It manages network policies, serializes/deserializes data, and handles HTTP requests for Azure Power BI management. No hardcoded secrets, external data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present. The request flow is typical, involving copying and formatting requests before sending, which is normal. No obfuscation or suspicious functions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical generated API client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a wrapper for Azure SDK operations, following standard practices. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
