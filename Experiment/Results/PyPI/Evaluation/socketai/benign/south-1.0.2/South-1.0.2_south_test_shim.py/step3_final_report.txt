  "purpose": "Import test modules for test discovery and setup.",
  "sources": "The import statement from south.tests, which loads test utilities or test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only imports modules without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from south.tests into the namespace; no data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from a test module; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple comment and an import statement importing all from south.tests. This is typical in test setup files to include test utilities or test cases. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The wildcard import ('*') is generally discouraged but common in test contexts and does not indicate malicious intent. The import does not involve external data, network activity, or sensitive information. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a test inclusion point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard test setup purpose. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, primarily due to the wildcard import concern, which is acceptable in this context.",
