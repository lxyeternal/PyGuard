  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and assess the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import of 'south.tests' and its role in test discovery.\n- **Flows & Sinks:** No malicious data flow or sink identified.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of 'import *' is noted but common in test setups.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just a test import.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Security Risk: 0.1 — perhaps slightly elevated due to 'import *', but acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the workaround nature and potential code execution during import.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Use of 'import *' again noted.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0 — appropriate, given no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the purpose for test discovery.\n- No suspicious activity or malicious behavior.\n- Minimal code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights the risk of wildcard import ('*') potentially importing malicious code if source compromised.\n- Notes that in test contexts, this is common but could be risky.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (no evidence of malware)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.1 — slightly higher due to wildcard import concern, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score is justified; no malware present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to others, emphasizes the benign nature of the import.\n- No suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import for test discovery.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The only minor concern is the use of 'import *', which is acknowledged but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports — consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, as this is a simple test import with minimal security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
