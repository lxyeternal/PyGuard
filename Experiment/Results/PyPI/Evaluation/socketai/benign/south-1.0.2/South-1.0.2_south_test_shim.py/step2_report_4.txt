  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Code content:** import * from south.tests\n- **Findings:** The import is standard for test setup; no malicious code or anomalies are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Code content:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** Similar reasoning; no malicious activity, just a workaround.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Code content:** Same import statement.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; minimal code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Code content:** Same import.\n- **Findings:** Use of wildcard import ('*') can be risky if source is compromised, but in test files, this is common and not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are acceptable. The report notes the risk of wildcard import but considers it minor.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Code content:** Same import.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; standard testing practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to wildcard import concerns, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the wildcard import, which is acceptable in test contexts.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import, but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature. No significant security concerns are evident, and the code serves a specific, non-malicious purpose in test setup.",
