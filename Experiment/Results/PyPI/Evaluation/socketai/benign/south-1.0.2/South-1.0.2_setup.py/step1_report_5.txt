{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the South package for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package information for Django database migrations.",
  "sources": "Import statements (setuptools.core.setup, distutils.core.setup, __version__ from south)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the setup function is used for configuration only.",
  "flows": "Import statements provide version info; setup function consolidates package metadata and package list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; standard setup script with version import from local package.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if necessary, which is a common pattern. It imports __version__ from the local 'south' package, then calls setup() with various package metadata and a long list of package names. The version import relies on the 'south' package's __version__, which is typical. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The package list and metadata are standard for a Python setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It only configures package metadata for distribution, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
