  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms the code is a straightforward setup script with no suspicious activity, code injection, or malware. The code only imports modules, retrieves a version, and calls `setup()` with static metadata.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it states the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (a minimal, perhaps default, value). This seems reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a typical setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1. The low risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard setup code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. The minimal risk score matches the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports—standard, safe setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a typical Python setup script, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no file writes, and no external data handling.\n- **Malware assessment:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code. The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree on this.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is justified. The small non-zero values (0.1) are acceptable as they may be default or conservative.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.1, but 0 is more precise given no issues)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores reflect its benign nature accurately.",
