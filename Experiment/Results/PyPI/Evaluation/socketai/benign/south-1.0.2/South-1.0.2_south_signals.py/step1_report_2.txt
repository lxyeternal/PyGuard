{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django signals related to migration events",
  "sources": "Imports from django.dispatch and django.conf, usage of settings.INSTALLED_APPS",
  "sinks": "Signals are defined and connected to potential callback functions (commented out)",
  "flows": "Signals are created; commented-out code hints at potential signal connection logic",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code that involves dynamic import and permission creation; no active malicious code or suspicious data handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for defining signals in Django. It creates three signals for migration events with specified providing_args. A block of commented-out code aims to connect a signal to create permissions for 'django.contrib.auth' but is inactive. There is no indication of data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The code appears straightforward and standard for Django signal handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django signals setup for migration events with no malicious activity detected. The commented-out code may suggest prior compatibility adjustments but is inactive and not malicious.",
