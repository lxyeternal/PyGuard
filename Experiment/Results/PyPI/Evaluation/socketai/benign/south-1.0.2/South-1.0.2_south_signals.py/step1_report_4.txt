  "purpose": "Define and connect Django signals related to database migrations, with some compatibility code commented out.",
  "sources": "django.dispatch.Signal, django.conf.settings",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines signals and comments out functions",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for compatibility, no active suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines Django signals for migration events. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs processed, no external communications, and no active malicious code. The commented-out section indicates a deprecated or removed compatibility feature, not malicious activity. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django signals setup with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The commented-out code suggests past compatibility adjustments but is inactive. Overall, it appears safe.",
