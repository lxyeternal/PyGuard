  "purpose": "Defines and registers custom Django signals related to migration events.",
  "sources": "Import statements from django.dispatch and django.conf; signal definitions; commented-out code for compatibility handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no external communication, no data leaks, no execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code defines signals but does not process external input or data flows; commented code does not execute.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code intended for compatibility, but no active malicious or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up Django signals for migration events, which is standard practice. No external inputs, data leaks, or malicious activity are evident. The commented code suggests prior compatibility handling but is inactive and safe. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django signals setup with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It appears to be standard application code.",
