  "purpose": "Defines custom Django signals related to database migrations, primarily for tracking migration events.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.dispatch and django.conf, creation of Signal objects, commented-out code involving django.contrib.auth.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or data leaks; no external network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; signals are used internally within Django's migration framework.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code that attempts to connect signals to permission creation, which is currently inactive. No suspicious code patterns or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom Django signals for migration events, which are standard Django practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The commented-out code indicates previous attempts to handle permissions during migration but is inactive. No unusual or potentially malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom signals for Django migrations with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
