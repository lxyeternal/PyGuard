{
  "purpose": "Define custom Django signals for migration events and maintain compatibility with django.contrib.auth.",
  "sources": "Importing django.dispatch.Signal, django.conf.settings, and defining signal instances; commented-out compatibility code for django.contrib.auth.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; signals are used internally within Django for application logic.",
  "flows": "Signal instances are created and potentially connected elsewhere; no direct data flow from untrusted sources identified.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code that suggests previous compatibility handling; no active suspicious code or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three Django signals related to migrations, which is standard practice. The commented-out block indicates prior compatibility code for django.contrib.auth, but it is inactive and harmless. No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no obfuscated code, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard Django signal setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The commented-out section does not introduce any vulnerabilities. Overall, it appears benign.",
