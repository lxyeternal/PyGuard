  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes for a migration framework, likely Django South.\n- All reports agree that the code is purely defining error classes with no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The traceback formatting functions used are standard and do not introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard exception class definitions; no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Only formats messages; no external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe exception class definitions, standard library usage, and no external data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Focuses on the absence of dynamic or external data handling, standard traceback formatting, and no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Correct.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Reiterates the same points: no external input, no malicious code, straightforward error classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Valid.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Similar conclusion: no suspicious patterns, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — **Consistent.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree that there's no malware present. The code is purely defining exception classes.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is only defining exception classes with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution, the overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**However,** considering the purpose of the code (error handling in a migration system), the risk score could be slightly elevated if the traceback information could potentially leak sensitive data. But in this case, the traceback is generated from internal exception info, and no user data is processed here.\n\n**Therefore, the scores should remain:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard exception class definitions.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- No external data or network activity.\n- Traceback formatting is used for debugging, not for malicious purposes.\n- The overall security posture is safe.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code analysis.",
