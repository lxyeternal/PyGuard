  "purpose": "Defines custom exception and warning classes for migration error handling in a database migration framework.",
  "sources": "Internal class attributes and traceback formatting functions used for error message generation.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and string representation methods generate messages from internal data; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Minor bug in DependsOnUnknownMigration.__str__() method: it uses print() instead of return, which is incorrect but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to migration errors. It employs standard Python traceback functions for debugging info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. The only issue is a minor bug in one __str__ method. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The traceback functions are used safely for debugging purposes. The exception classes serve error reporting without external influence or payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The minor bug in __str__ does not impact security. The overall security risk and malware scores should be 0, with high confidence.",
