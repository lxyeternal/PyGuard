{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for managing errors, warnings, and specific conditions within a migration framework, likely related to database schema migrations.",
  "sources": "None of the classes read external input or data; code mainly initializes exception objects with static or passed-in data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems, network, or files; it only formats exception messages for display.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data flow or execute any code with untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code strictly defines exception classes without any suspicious or unusual behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be exploited. It follows standard Python practices for custom exceptions and error messages. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The structure and purpose are clear, focusing on error reporting within a migration management context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of exception class definitions used for managing errors in a migration system. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It is a straightforward implementation with no security risks detected.",
