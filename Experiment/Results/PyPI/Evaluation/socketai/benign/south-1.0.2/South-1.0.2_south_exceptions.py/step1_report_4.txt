{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling migration errors and warnings in a Django South database migration context.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class and method definitions, exception instantiations, and string formatting with no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data is being written to external systems, network, or storage; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs that could lead to leaks or injections.",
  "flows": "The code only creates and formats exception messages; there are no flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. All functions and classes serve standard error handling and messaging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of custom exception classes, primarily for error reporting in migration operations. It involves class inheritance, string formatting, and exception handling, but no input processing, network operations, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The use of format_exception and format_exc for traceback formatting is standard for debugging purposes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The structure is straightforward, with clear purpose for each class.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, non-malicious collection of custom exception classes for managing migration errors. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks present.",
