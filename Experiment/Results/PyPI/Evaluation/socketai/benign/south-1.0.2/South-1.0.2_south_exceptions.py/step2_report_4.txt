  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code's content and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\nThe provided code is a collection of custom exception and warning class definitions used within a migration framework, likely for Django South. It employs standard Python practices, uses traceback formatting functions, and contains no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve error reporting and messaging purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues\n- **Presence of Issues:** None. The code is purely class definitions with no active logic that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic\n- **Minor Observation:** In the class `DependsOnUnknownMigration`, the `__str__` method uses `print()` instead of `return`. This is a mistake because exception `__str__` methods should return strings, not print them. This could lead to unexpected behavior when the exception's string representation is invoked.\n\n### Score Analysis and Recommendations\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. The code contains no malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The classes are straightforward and serve error handling purposes.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or code hiding.\n- **Risk Score:** 0. The code is standard exception class definitions with no security implications.\n\n### Specific Points\n- The `DependsOnUnknownMigration` class's `__str__` method should return the string instead of printing it. This is a logical flaw but not a security risk.\n- All other classes are correctly implemented with proper `__str__` methods returning strings.\n- The traceback formatting functions (`format_exception`, `format_exc`) are used appropriately for debugging info, not malicious purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n### Additional Recommendations\n- Fix the `DependsOnUnknownMigration.__str__()` method to return the string instead of printing it to ensure proper exception message handling.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for migration error handling. The only flaw is a minor bug in one `__str__` method, which does not impact security. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and contains no security risks or malware.",
