  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a Django South migration tool, primarily for error handling and warning notifications related to database migrations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or data; it defines classes and string representations for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could be used maliciously or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code primarily constructs exception messages based on internal data.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It relies on standard string formatting and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for exception handling within a migration framework. It does not include input validation, external data sources, or network operations. All string formatting is based on internal attributes, and there are no dangerous or malicious operations detected. The code appears to be standard application logic without obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as error and warning class definitions for migration operations. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are present. It is safe and not suspicious.",
