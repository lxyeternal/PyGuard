{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and error handling for South migration management in Django projects.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read directly in the code; only standard library functions such as format_exception and format_exc are used for exception formatting.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network communication, or untrusted data handling are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes and string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic, are present. The code strictly focuses on exception handling and messaging.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes derived from built-in exceptions, used for error reporting within South migrations. It employs standard library functions for formatting exception traceback information. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling mechanisms. All classes serve to encapsulate error information and provide meaningful messages. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for Django South migration error handling. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
