  "purpose": "Defines a Django model for tracking migration history, with utility methods for retrieving migration information.",
  "sources": "Reads from the database using Django ORM; retrieves data via cls.objects or cls.objects.using()",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to injection if app_name or migration are externally manipulated, but in this context, they are set internally or via ORM methods",
  "flows": "MigrationHistory.for_migration() retrieves data based on migration.app_label() and migration.name(), then get_migrations() and get_migration() fetch migration details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code raises an exception for unsupported Django versions and uses standard Django ORM practices",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages migration records via Django ORM, with version check at the start. The for_migration method dynamically retrieves records based on migration attributes, but it relies on migration.app_label() and migration.name(), which are assumed to be safe. No external input is directly used in dangerous ways. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy leaks. The use of ORM is standard, and the code does not perform unsafe operations or handle untrusted data beyond typical ORM usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django migration tracking model with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not include any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a normal implementation with no apparent security issues.",
