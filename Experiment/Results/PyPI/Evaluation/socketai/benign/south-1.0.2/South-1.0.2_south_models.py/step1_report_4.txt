  "purpose": "Define a Django model for tracking migration history, with utility methods for retrieving migration info.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class methods accessing database models, and external module imports (django, south).",
  "sinks": "Database queries in for_migration() method, especially the get() call, which may handle untrusted input if migration or database parameters are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to for_migration() (migration, database) flow into a database query via get() method. External modules (django, south) are used for version checks and migration handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to handle missing entries; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code. The version check at the beginning enforces South support only for older Django versions, which is standard for legacy support.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model and associated methods to manage migration history. The version check prevents use with unsupported Django versions. The for_migration() method queries the database based on provided migration info, which could be manipulated if migration app_label() or name() are unsafe. However, these are typically derived from trusted migration objects, not user input. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is detected. External modules are used appropriately, and no obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django migration tracking model with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on trusted migration objects and standard Django practices. No malware or malicious behavior is identified.",
