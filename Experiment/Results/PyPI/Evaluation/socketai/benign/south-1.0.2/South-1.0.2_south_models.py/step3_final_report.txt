  "flows": "migration.app_label()/name() -> ORM filters -> retrieval or creation of MigrationHistory objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; ORM queries depend on migration object attributes which are typically trusted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model with version enforcement and ORM methods for migration tracking. No external network calls, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. ORM queries are standard; the version check is a common compatibility measure. The migration attribute methods are trusted in typical contexts. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Django migration history model with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context. No modifications are necessary.",
