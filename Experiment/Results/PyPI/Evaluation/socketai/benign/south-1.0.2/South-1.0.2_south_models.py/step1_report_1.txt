  "purpose": "Define a Django model for tracking migration history and provide utility methods for migration management.",
  "sources": "The code reads Django version info, database alias, and migration attributes from migration objects.",
  "sinks": "Uses Django ORM queries to fetch or create MigrationHistory objects based on migration data.",
  "flows": "Version check influences import flow; migration data is used in database queries; method calls process migration info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The version check raises an exception intentionally.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies Django version to prevent compatibility issues with South. It defines a model with fields for app name, migration, and timestamp. Class methods retrieve or instantiate migration records based on migration object attributes, considering multi-database setups. No external network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration observed. The version check ensures compatibility but is straightforward. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django migration history tracking model with utility methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
