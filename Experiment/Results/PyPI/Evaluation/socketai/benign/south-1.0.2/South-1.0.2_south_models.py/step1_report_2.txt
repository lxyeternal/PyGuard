{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django model for tracking migration history and includes utility methods for migration retrieval.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.db and south.db, reading Django version info, and model fields.",
  "sinks": "Potential database queries via ORM methods, particularly in for_migration and get_migrations.",
  "flows": "Model method calls lead to ORM queries that may access the database, potentially based on external data in migration objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution; no suspicious network activity or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a Django model with class methods to retrieve migration info. The only data flow involving external inputs is through the migration object parameters in for_migration, which are used in ORM queries. These are standard and safe within the ORM context. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward, compatible with Django and South migrations, and does not contain obfuscated code or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django migration tracking code with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It is safe and does not include malicious payloads or backdoors.",
