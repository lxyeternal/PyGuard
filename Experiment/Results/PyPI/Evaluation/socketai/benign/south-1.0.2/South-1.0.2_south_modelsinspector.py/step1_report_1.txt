{
  "purpose": "The code provides introspection utilities for Django ORM models and fields, primarily for South migrations, enabling automatic generation of schema definitions and related metadata.",
  "sources": "Data is read from Django model classes, fields, and meta options, including attributes like model._meta, field properties, and class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write or send data to external systems or perform dangerous operations such as network communication or system modification.",
  "flows": "Model and field data flows through functions like get_model_fields, get_model_meta, and introspector, transforming model definitions into serializable representations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic attribute access, reflection, and introspection without validation, but these are standard for ORM introspection. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The convert_on_delete_handler function inspects closure contents, which is complex but part of standard ORM handling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility for Django ORM model introspection, facilitating schema migration tasks with introspection rules and meta-data extraction. It employs reflection and dynamic attribute access to interpret model fields and metadata, which is typical for such tools. No external network communication, file modification, or other malicious activities are present. The code does contain complex reflection logic, particularly in functions like convert_on_delete_handler and get_value, but these are consistent with ORM serialization requirements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard introspection utility for Django models, used by South migrations to automate schema serialization. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Its complexity is justified by the need for flexible ORM introspection. Overall security risk is low.",
