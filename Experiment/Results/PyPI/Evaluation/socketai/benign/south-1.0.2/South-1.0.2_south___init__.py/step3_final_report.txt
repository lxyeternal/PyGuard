  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for version and authors of a Django app package",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__version__, __authors__)",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external interactions",
  "flows": "None; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward metadata without obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string variables defining version and authors. No functions, data processing, external calls, or dynamic code are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign metadata. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the static, metadata-only nature. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the benign assessment. No adjustments needed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The code poses no threat and can be considered safe.",
