{
  "purpose": "This script checks the version of Apache Airflow and raises an error if it is below 2.9.0; it is part of a package setup or validation process.",
  "sources": "Reads the installed Airflow version via import (__version__ from airflow) and the package version string (__version__ = \"5.2.1\").",
  "sinks": "Raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the Airflow version, compares it to a minimum required version, and may raise an exception based on the comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard version check and exception raising logic. The version string (__version__) is hardcoded but appears to be standard metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version information from the airflow package, compares it with a hardcoded minimum requirement, and raises an error if the environment does not meet the requirement. The code is straightforward and typical for package validation. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The only potential concern is the hardcoded version string, which could be outdated, but that does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard version check for compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior. It is a typical validation script to ensure correct environment setup.",
