{
  "purpose": "This code sets up version checks and licensing information for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring compatibility with specific Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via import (__version__ from airflow) and uses hardcoded strings for the version comparison.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises a RuntimeError if version requirements are not met; no data output or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing dependencies to checking the Airflow version and potentially raising an error based on the version comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard for package version validation with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a version string. It compares the installed Airflow version with a minimum required version (2.9.0). If the installed version is below this threshold, it raises a RuntimeError to prevent incompatible usage. The code is straightforward, primarily for version validation, with no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard version validation check for package compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It functions solely to prevent incompatible package usage based on versioning.",
