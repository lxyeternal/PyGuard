{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a package initialization script, primarily for version validation and module exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported version of Airflow from the airflow package and the local __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a controlled exception; no data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "The airflow version is fetched from the imported airflow package; this value is parsed and compared against a minimum required version. If the version check fails, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "The __version__ is hardcoded as '5.2.1'. The code includes version parsing and comparison, but no suspicious or unusual code constructs are present. The comment notes automatic code generation, which is typical for boilerplate code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version parsing library, retrieves the airflow version, and compares it with a minimum version. If the version is lower than 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError. The purpose is to enforce version compatibility. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code performs standard version checks and module exports. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe code practices are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate version check with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to ensure compatibility before usage, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
