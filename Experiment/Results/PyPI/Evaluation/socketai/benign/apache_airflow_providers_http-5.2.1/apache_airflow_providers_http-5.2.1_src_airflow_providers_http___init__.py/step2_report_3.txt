  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code performs straightforward version validation by importing `__version__` from the `airflow` package and comparing it to a hardcoded minimum version (`2.9.0`).\n- If the installed Airflow version is below this threshold, it raises a `RuntimeError`.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for ensuring compatibility.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs, data leaks, external network calls, or secret handling are present.\n- The code is not obfuscated, and the logic is clear.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The version check logic is correct and consistent.\n- The code does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The hardcoded `__version__ = \"5.2.1\"` appears to be a package version string, which is typical.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- The `__version__` string is hardcoded as `\"5.2.1\"`. While this is standard, if this version is outdated or inconsistent with the actual package version, it could cause confusion, but it is not malicious.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are introduced by this code.\n\n---\n\n### Malware, obfuscation, and risk scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0              | No malicious code or obfuscation; standard version check. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Same as above; straightforward logic. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0              | No malicious behavior; just version validation. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Standard package validation code. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0              | Typical setup code with no malicious elements. |\n\n**All reports** should have malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports, as the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The only minor point is the hardcoded version string (`\"5.2.1\"`), which could be outdated or inconsistent with the actual package version, but this does not pose a security risk.\n- The code's purpose is purely for version validation, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n**The code is a standard, safe version validation snippet with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues.** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. I would maintain the scores at **0** for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's actual behavior.",
