{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and verifies the version compatibility for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring it is used with a compatible Airflow version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported Airflow version (__version__ from airflow) and the local __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not send data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "The code parses the airflow version and compares it with a specified minimum version to determine if an exception should be raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected; the code performs straightforward version checks and imports without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly composed of standard imports, version parsing, and a conditional check that raises an exception if the environment does not meet the minimum required version. All operations involve benign, explicit version comparisons. No user input or untrusted data is processed, and there are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version validation script for ensuring compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
