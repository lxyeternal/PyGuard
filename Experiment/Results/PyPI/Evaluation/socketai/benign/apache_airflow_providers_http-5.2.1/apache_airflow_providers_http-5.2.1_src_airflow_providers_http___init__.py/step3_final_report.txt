  "purpose": "Version validation and licensing information for the airflow provider package.",
  "sources": "Imports airflow.__version__ and uses packaging.version.parse for comparison.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Imports airflow.__version__, compares with hardcoded '2.9.0', raises RuntimeError if below.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded __version__ string '5.2.1', but this is standard metadata; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version check, importing airflow.__version__ and comparing it to a minimum required version. It raises an error if the environment does not meet the requirement. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present. The __version__ string is hardcoded, which is typical for package metadata. The logic is correct, and no external data or network activity occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version validation script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 (reflecting minimal potential concern over version string manipulation, which is not evident here). Overall, the code is safe and typical for package validation.",
