  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from AirflowException.\n   - No dynamic execution, input handling, network operations, or data processing.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for defining custom exceptions.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no issues or malicious behaviors present in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly describe the code as benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of data flow, untrusted input, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, static class definitions with no malicious activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior is observed.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustment needed; scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; they base their conclusions on the code's static, straightforward nature.\n   - No speculative claims are made about possible exploits or hidden behaviors.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python, especially within frameworks like Airflow.\n- There is no indication of malicious intent, hidden code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided reports' assessments and scores.**",
