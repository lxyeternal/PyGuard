{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP-related errors within an Airflow plugin or workflow.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could be processed or leaked, as no data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code solely defines exception classes without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard; no unusual or suspicious constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for compatibility, then defines two simple custom exception classes inheriting from AirflowException. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic or side effects are present. The file appears to be a standard part of an exception handling hierarchy for an Airflow hook, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard code defining custom exceptions for HTTP errors in Airflow. There are no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
