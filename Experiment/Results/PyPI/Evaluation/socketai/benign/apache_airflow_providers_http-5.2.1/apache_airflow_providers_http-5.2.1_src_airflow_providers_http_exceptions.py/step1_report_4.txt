  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling HTTP-related errors in Airflow workflows.",
  "sources": "Imported from airflow.exceptions, no external or user input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard; no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes inheriting from AirflowException. It includes license comments, import statements, and class definitions with docstrings. There are no input/output operations, external communications, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard definition of custom exceptions for HTTP error handling within Airflow, with no indicators of malicious intent or security issues.",
