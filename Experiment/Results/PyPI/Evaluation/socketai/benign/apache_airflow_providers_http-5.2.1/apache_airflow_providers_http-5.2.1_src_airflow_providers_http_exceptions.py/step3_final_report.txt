  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP errors within the Airflow framework.",
  "sources": "Import of AirflowException; class definitions for HttpErrorException and HttpMethodException.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Class definitions do not involve data flow; no runtime data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static class definitions inheriting from AirflowException, with license headers and docstrings. No dynamic execution, input handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is typical for defining custom exceptions in Python frameworks. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for an Airflow hook. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward structure.",
