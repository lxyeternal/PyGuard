{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP errors and invalid methods within the Airflow framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and docstrings provide information on exception handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines classes and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature, then defines two custom exception classes inheriting from AirflowException, each with descriptive docstrings. It is a typical pattern for defining specific exceptions, with no input handling, no external data sources, and no dangerous behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for use within the Airflow framework. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks identified.",
