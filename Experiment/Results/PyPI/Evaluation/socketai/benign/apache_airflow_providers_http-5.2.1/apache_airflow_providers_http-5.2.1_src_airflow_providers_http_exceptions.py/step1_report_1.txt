  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP errors in an Airflow hook.",
  "sources": "Import statement for AirflowException, class definitions for HttpErrorException and HttpMethodException.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or untrusted input processing evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from a known exception class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard exception class from Airflow and defines two custom exceptions for specific HTTP error cases. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. It does not handle or process user input, environment variables, or perform any network operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of custom exception classes intended for use within an Airflow hook context. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks present in this code snippet.",
