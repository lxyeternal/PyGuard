  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a standard, straightforward implementation defining two custom exception classes inheriting from `AirflowException`.\n   - It includes license comments, import statements, and class definitions with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, external data sources, network operations, or obfuscated code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The code's purpose appears to be to facilitate specific exception handling within an Airflow hook.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious constructs.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n   - Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0 across reports, aligning with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Logical Flaws:**\n   - No issues are evident in the code or the reports.\n   - The reasoning is sound: the code is purely class definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n   - The analysis appropriately dismisses any concerns about obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code snippet is a typical, harmless set of custom exception classes.\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code.\n   - There is no evidence to suggest any security concern.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are justified.\n- No further action or escalation is necessary.\n- The code can be considered safe and standard within its context.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
