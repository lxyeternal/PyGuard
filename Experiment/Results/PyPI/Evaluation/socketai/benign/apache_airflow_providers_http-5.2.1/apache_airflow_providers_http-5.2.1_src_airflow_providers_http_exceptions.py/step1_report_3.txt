  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for HTTP errors in an Airflow context.",
  "sources": "Import statement for airflow.exceptions and the class definitions which are static.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, input, or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific exception class and defines two new exception subclasses with descriptive docstrings. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or network interactions. The structure and content are standard for exception class definitions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for an Airflow plugin or module. No malicious or security issues detected.",
