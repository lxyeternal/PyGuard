  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for `HttpErrorException` and `HttpMethodException`, both inheriting from `AirflowException`.\n   - It includes standard license headers and an import statement.\n   - No dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or data processing are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, static, and serve as custom exception types within an Airflow context.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - No external data sources, user inputs, or environment variables are processed.\n   - No network communication, credential handling, or data leaks are evident.\n   - The code is typical for defining custom exceptions in a framework.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks & Scores:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior or code. The code is benign.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present.\n\n4. **Review of Report Conclusions & Scores:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n   - The detailed analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime behavior, it inherently carries no security risk.\n   - The purpose of these classes is to facilitate exception handling, which is standard practice.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nGiven the evidence, the code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of custom exceptions. The scores reflect this accurately. No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**No adjustments needed.**",
