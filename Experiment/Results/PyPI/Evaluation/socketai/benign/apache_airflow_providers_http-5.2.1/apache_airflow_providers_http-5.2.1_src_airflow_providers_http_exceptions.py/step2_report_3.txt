  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining two custom exception classes inheriting from AirflowException.\n- The code includes a standard license header, an import statement, and straightforward class definitions with docstrings.\n- No dynamic behavior, input handling, external data sources, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.\n- The confidence scores are all at 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: simple class definitions for exceptions.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- Since the code is purely class definitions, it cannot be malicious or obfuscated unless intentionally hidden, which is not indicated here.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment and scoring.\n\n**Risk and malware scores:**\n- Given the benign nature, the risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- Malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Obfuscated code score of 0 is correct.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for an Airflow hook.\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The current scores accurately reflect the code's benign nature.",
