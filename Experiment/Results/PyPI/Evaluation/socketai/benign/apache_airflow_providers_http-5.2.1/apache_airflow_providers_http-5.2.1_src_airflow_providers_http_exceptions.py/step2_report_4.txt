  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `AirflowException`.\n   - The code only imports a known exception class and defines two subclasses with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and contains no security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, standard, and free of suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues with the reports' reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is purely class definitions, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, such as executing external code, handling untrusted input, or including obfuscated segments.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for an Airflow hook. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scoring reflects the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
