  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only a license header comment with no executable code or data processing.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only static comment headers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; comment block does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; purely licensing comments with standard formatting.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is solely a license header comment with no executable statements, data sources, sinks, or flows. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the content. No suspicious activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The comments are standard licensing boilerplate, and there are no anomalies or irregularities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only licensing comments with no security implications. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
