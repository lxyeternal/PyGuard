  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard HTTP hook implementation with no suspicious activity. It reads configuration from Airflow connections, handles requests with retries, and manages errors responsibly.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The low security risk score aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no hardcoded secrets, and proper error handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical HTTP client with configurable options. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring is consistent; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard HTTP request handler with no signs of malicious behavior. Uses connection info and request parameters securely.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation; the code aligns with typical HTTP client implementations.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard HTTP hook with secure handling of connection details and request execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** No malicious indicators; the code's logic is straightforward and secure.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical HTTP client with standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects the low but non-zero inherent risk of network code that processes untrusted input. These are reasonable given the context.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of HTTP hooks within Airflow.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, typical network code risk, especially given untrusted input handling)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
