  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate for its intended purpose but includes a serialization method (pickle) that could be exploited if response data is malicious and deserialized insecurely elsewhere. No malware or malicious intent is detected. The overall security risk is moderate due to pickle serialization, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious behavior."
