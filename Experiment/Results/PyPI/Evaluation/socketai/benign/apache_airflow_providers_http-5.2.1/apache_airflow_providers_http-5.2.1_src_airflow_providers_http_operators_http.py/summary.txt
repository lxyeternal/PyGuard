  "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the use of pickle.loads() on data from trigger events, which can be exploited for remote code execution if the payload is malicious. This vulnerability justifies high malware and risk scores (around 0.8-0.9). The rest of the code is standard and not malicious. The scores in the initial reports are generally accurate, but for the deserialization step, higher scores should be assigned to reflect the severity of this security flaw."
