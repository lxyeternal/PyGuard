  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code; only licensing comments, no unusual or suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The provided code is solely a licensing comment header, which is standard boilerplate text used to specify licensing terms for open-source projects. There are no executable statements, data inputs, or data outputs. Since it contains only comments, there are no potential security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The header appears to be typical of Apache-licensed code files, with no signs of hidden or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely a licensing comment header with no executable code or suspicious activity. It presents no security threats or malware risk.",
