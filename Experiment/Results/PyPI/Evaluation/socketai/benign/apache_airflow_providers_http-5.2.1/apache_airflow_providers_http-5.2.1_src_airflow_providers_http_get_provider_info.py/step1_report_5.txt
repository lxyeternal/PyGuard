  "purpose": "This code defines a function that returns metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-http' package, including its versions, integrations, operators, sensors, hooks, triggers, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The data source is the return statement within the get_provider_info() function, which supplies static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present. The code only returns static data without processing external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks, as all data is predefined and returned statically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains straightforward static data definitions and a simple function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated Python function that returns a dictionary containing package metadata information. There are no external input sources, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, no network communication, and no user-controlled data. It primarily serves as a data provider for package info, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns. The code structure is simple and standard, with no complex logic or potentially dangerous constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, auto-generated metadata function that provides static information about a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
