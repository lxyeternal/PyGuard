  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated, and merely returns hardcoded package metadata.\n- No external data sources, user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious logic are detected.\n- The dependencies are standard Python packages with specified version constraints.\n- The code structure is simple, straightforward, and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports indicate the code is benign, static, and auto-generated with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None. The code functions as a static data provider without any logical flaws.\n- **Security flaws:** None. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Reporting inaccuracies:** No inaccuracies detected; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, as there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is purely static and auto-generated, with no external data handling or dynamic execution, the risk score should remain **0**.\n- The malware score should also be **0**, given the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly **0**.\n\n### Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- No claims are made that suggest vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions; all evidence points to benign static data.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, static metadata provider with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply returns hardcoded package information, which is typical for such auto-generated files.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, benign, and poses no security threat.",
