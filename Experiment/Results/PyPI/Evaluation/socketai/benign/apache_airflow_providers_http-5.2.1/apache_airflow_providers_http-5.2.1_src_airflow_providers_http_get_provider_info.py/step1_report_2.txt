{
  "purpose": "The function get_provider_info returns static metadata about the apache-airflow-providers-http package, including version info, integrations, operators, sensors, hooks, triggers, dependencies, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded within the get_provider_info function and its return statement; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs a static dictionary; there are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the code solely returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning fixed package metadata. It includes version lists, documentation URLs, and dependency specifications, all hardcoded. No input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution occurs. The content appears standard and typical for a package metadata function. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static metadata provider with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely returns predefined information about the package. No anomalies or malware are detected.",
