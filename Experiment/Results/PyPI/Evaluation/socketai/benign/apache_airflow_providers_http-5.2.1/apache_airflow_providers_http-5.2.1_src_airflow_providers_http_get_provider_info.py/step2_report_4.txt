  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no dynamic or external data handling.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The code simply returns hardcoded package metadata, dependencies, and documentation links.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No signs of malware, suspicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is a straightforward function returning a static dictionary.\n- The dependency list is standard and version-constrained appropriately.\n- No external input, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The reports are consistent and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No vulnerabilities or security issues identified.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The static nature of the code minimizes risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the assessments are accurate and justified.",
