  "purpose": "This code provides metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-http' package, including version info, integrations, operators, sensors, hooks, triggers, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, lists, and dictionaries hardcoded within the get_provider_info() function. No external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially cause security issues. No output operations involve external or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code simply returns a static data structure; there are no data flows from sources to sinks, nor any dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and auto-generated. It contains no obfuscated code, malicious logic, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static, auto-generated metadata provider for a Python package, listing various package details and dependencies. It contains no user input, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution. The dependencies are standard Python packages with specified version constraints. The code's structure is simple and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, auto-generated metadata provider with no malicious behavior or security risks. It serves solely to supply package information. There are no indications of malware, suspicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
