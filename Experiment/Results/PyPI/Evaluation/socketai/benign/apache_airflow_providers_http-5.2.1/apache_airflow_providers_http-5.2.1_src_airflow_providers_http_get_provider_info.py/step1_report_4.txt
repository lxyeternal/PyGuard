  "purpose": "Provide metadata and version information about the apache-airflow-providers-http package, including its description, versions, integrations, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings and lists within the get_provider_info() function.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The data flows from hardcoded metadata sources through return statements to consumers of this function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that returns a dictionary with static package metadata. It contains no user input handling, no external data fetching, no command execution, and no dynamic code evaluation. All data is hardcoded and static. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs present. The code appears to be automatically generated metadata for documentation or package management purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a static, automatically generated metadata provider with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply returns package information and dependencies without any processing of external or untrusted data.",
