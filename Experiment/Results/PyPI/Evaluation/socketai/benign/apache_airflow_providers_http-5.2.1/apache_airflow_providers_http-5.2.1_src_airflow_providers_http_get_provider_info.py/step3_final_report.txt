  "purpose": "Provides static package metadata information for the apache-airflow-providers-http package, including versions, dependencies, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within the get_provider_info() function, including package details, dependencies, and documentation URLs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "The function simply returns static data; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, auto-generated, and contains no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning a fixed dictionary with package metadata. It involves no external data sources, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is simple and standard for auto-generated package info files. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. Dependencies are standard with version constraints. The code's purpose is informational, and it poses no security risks or vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign, static data provisioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and auto-generated, serving as package metadata. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
