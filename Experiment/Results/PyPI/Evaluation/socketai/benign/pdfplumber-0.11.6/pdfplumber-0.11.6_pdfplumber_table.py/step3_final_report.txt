{
  "purpose": "The code implements utilities for detecting, merging, and analyzing table structures within PDF pages, primarily through geometric and clustering methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from PDF page edges, text characters, and clustering outputs, notably via functions like 'extract_words', 'cluster_objects', and 'edges'.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks such as network calls, file modifications, or system commands; data flows are contained within geometric and text processing functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from PDF page extraction (edges, characters) through clustering and geometric processing, culminating in table structure detection without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and relies on standard geometric and clustering operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs geometric analysis of PDF page layout, clustering of text and edges, and table cell detection. It uses utility functions presumed benign for processing. No signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions are typical for layout analysis, with no suspicious logic or external system interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of PDF table detection techniques, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behaviors. The utility functions and data flows are benign, and the overall security profile is very low.",
