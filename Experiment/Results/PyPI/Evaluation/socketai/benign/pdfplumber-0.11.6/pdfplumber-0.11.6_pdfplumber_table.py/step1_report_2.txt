{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for detecting and processing table structures in PDF pages, including identifying edges, intersections, and organizing table cells.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters, object properties, and external modules like utils for processing PDF page data, edges, words, and bounding boxes.",
  "sinks": "Uses external utility functions for processing data, but no direct sinks like network, file I/O, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from page extraction methods through edge and intersection calculations, leading to table cell organization and final table object creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code mostly handles geometric calculations and data organization; no malicious obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically processes page data to identify table structures, relying on external utility functions for core operations such as snapping, clustering, and filtering edges. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden malicious logic. All functions perform geometrical and organizational tasks. No network, system, or privacy-violating actions are present. No obfuscation or suspicious control flow detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for table detection in PDFs. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage elements. The functions focus on geometric processing and data organization relevant to table extraction, with no evident security risks.",
