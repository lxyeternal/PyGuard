  "purpose": "Module initialization and API export setup for a PDF processing library.",
  "sources": "Imports of pdfminer, utils, __version__, PDF, repair; assignment of PDF.open to open.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Imported modules and assigned open = PDF.open; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Assignment 'open = PDF.open' may be unconventional but is a common aliasing pattern; no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing necessary modules and creating an alias for PDF.open. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The aliasing pattern is benign and standard. No suspicious signals, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with the slight risk score justified by the aliasing pattern but not indicative of any threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe module setup with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the benign, standard nature of the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
