  "purpose": "Rendering, annotating, and saving images of PDF pages for visualization and debugging.",
  "sources": "Input streams/files (stream, path), PDF document, page data, user-provided coordinates.",
  "sinks": "Generated PIL images, saved image files or streams, drawing operations on images.",
  "flows": "Input stream/path -> PDF document creation -> page rendering -> image cropping and scaling -> drawing annotations -> saving output image.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (pypdfium2, PIL) for PDF rendering and image annotation. It handles input streams or files safely, with exception handling for PDF errors. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or secret handling are present. Drawing functions are for visualization, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation observed. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for rendering and annotating PDF pages. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low security risk score is appropriate given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
