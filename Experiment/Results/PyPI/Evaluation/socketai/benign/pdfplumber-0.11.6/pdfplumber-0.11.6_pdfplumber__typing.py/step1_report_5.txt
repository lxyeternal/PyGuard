{
  "purpose": "This code defines type aliases for various data structures and types, likely to improve code readability and type checking.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and aliases are defined directly within the code; no external data input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks or data flows are present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident, as the code only declares type aliases without runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code consists solely of type alias definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases for sequences, numbers, points, bounding boxes, objects, and text directions. It uses Python's typing module to enhance static type checking. There are no function calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed. The code appears to be a standard, straightforward set of type alias declarations for use in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign code defining type aliases for clarity and type safety. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
