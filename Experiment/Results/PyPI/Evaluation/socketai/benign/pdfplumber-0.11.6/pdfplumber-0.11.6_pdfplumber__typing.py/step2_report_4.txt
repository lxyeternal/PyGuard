  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static type alias definitions using Python's typing module.\n- None mention any runtime logic, data handling, external interactions, or suspicious constructs.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving to improve code readability and static type checking.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The use of `Literal` within `Union` for `T_dir` is standard and not suspicious.\n- The code does not contain any executable code, data processing, or network interactions.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and purely structural.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, clear code.\n- Security risk: 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign, standard set of type alias definitions with no security concerns.",
