{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various data structures used in Python programs, likely for type hinting and code clarity.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "targets": "No data sinks or outputs; code only establishes type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow; this is purely type aliasing without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Literal in Union, which is valid but slightly verbose; no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes multiple type aliases for sequences, numbers, points, bounding boxes, objects, lists of objects, iterables of objects, and directional hints. It uses Python typing constructs to improve code readability and type checking. There are no functions, data inputs, outputs, or logic that could be exploited or used maliciously. The use of type hints with Literal is standard for constraining values. Overall, the code appears purely declarative and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward set of type alias definitions intended for type hinting, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and purely structural.",
