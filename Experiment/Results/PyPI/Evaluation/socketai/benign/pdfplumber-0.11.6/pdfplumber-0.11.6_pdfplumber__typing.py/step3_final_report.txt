  "purpose": "Define various type aliases for use in static type checking within Python codebases, improving code clarity and consistency.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains static type alias definitions using the typing module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process data or execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions for sequences, numbers, points, bounding boxes, objects, object lists, object iterables, and directional literals. It uses standard Python typing constructs, including Union, Tuple, Dict, List, Iterable, and Literal. No runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. The use of Literal within Union for T_dir is standard and not suspicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The code is static, declarative, and serves as a structural aid for static type checking. All signals indicate benign intent, with no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as purely structural, and the assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
