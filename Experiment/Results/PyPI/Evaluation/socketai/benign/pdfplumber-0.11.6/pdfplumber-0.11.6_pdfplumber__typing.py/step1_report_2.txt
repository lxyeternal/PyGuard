{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various data structures and constants for use in Python code, likely to improve code readability and type checking.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains import statements and variable/type alias definitions without input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data processing or untrusted data handling operations present.",
  "flows": "None; as there are no data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses type aliasing with the 'typing' module; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple type hints and defines several type aliases for readability and type safety, including unions and tuples for different data structures. No input, output, network activity, or dynamic code execution exists. The code appears to be purely declarative and structural, with no logic or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard type alias definitions and import statements, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
