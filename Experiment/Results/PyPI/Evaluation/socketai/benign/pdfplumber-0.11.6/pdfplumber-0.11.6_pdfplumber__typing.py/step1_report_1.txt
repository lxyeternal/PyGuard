{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various data structures used in a Python program, enhancing code readability and type checking.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; type alias definitions are static and declarative.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely contains type alias assignments without runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and adheres to standard type annotation practices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for sequences, numerical types, points, bounding boxes, objects, object lists, object iterables, and directional literals. All definitions are static, using Python's typing module, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of type alias declarations intended for static type checking. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is purely structural. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present.",
