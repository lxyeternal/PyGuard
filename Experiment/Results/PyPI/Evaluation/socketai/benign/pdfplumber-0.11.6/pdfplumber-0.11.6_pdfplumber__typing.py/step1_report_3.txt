  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various data structures and data types used in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "N/A (The code contains only type alias definitions; no data input sources are present.)",
  "sinks": "N/A (No data processing, output, or external data sinks are present in this code snippet.)",
  "flows": "N/A (There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only declares type aliases.)",
  "anomalies": "Use of Literal within Union in T_dir; no executable or dynamic code present; no secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines type aliases using Python's typing module, including Sequence, Union, Tuple, Dict, List, and Literal. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. The use of Literal in T_dir specifies allowed string literals for directionality, which is standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward, static type alias declaration intended for type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of type alias definitions for data structures and types, with no executable code or data processing. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious intent. It is a benign part of a larger codebase focused on type annotations.",
