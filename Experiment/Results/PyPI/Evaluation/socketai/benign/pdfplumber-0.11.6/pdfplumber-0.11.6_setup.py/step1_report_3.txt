  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the pdfplumber Python library, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads from local files: '_version.py', 'requirements.txt', 'requirements-dev.txt', 'README.md'; environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec() to execute code from '_version.py'; no other sinks such as network or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from '_version.py' via exec(), then proceeds to read dependency files and package setup configuration without untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from '_version.py' introduces potential risk if this file is tampered with; otherwise, the code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard setup tasks: reading version info via exec(), loading requirements, and configuring setuptools. The use of exec() on a local version file is a potential concern if that file is malicious, but typically this is a controlled process. No network connections, cryptic obfuscation, or hidden code are present. The rest of the code involves static data and conventional setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor risk associated with executing version information via exec(). No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident beyond this controlled risk. The overall security posture is acceptable with low confidence that malicious activity exists, provided the '_version.py' file is trustworthy.",
