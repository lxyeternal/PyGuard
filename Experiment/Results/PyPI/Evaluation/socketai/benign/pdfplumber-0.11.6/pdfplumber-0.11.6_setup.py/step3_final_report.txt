  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for the pdfplumber package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py', reads requirements files, reads README.md, and loads package data.",
  "sinks": "Executes code from '_version.py' via exec(), which could run arbitrary code if the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Reads '_version.py' content and executes it with exec(), loads dependencies, and reads long description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on '_version.py' introduces a potential security risk if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of exec() to evaluate '_version.py', which could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with. No other suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The scores in the reports vary, but generally, malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The security risk score should reflect the potential for code execution; a moderate score (~0.2-0.45) is justified if the version file is trusted. To mitigate risk, consider replacing exec() with safer alternatives like importlib or static import. Overall, the code is benign, with the primary concern being the trustworthiness of '_version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and benign, with the only notable security consideration being the use of exec() to load version info. Ensuring the integrity of '_version.py' minimizes this risk. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is detected.",
