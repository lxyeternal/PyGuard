  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script, no malicious intent.  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, straightforward code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0  \n**Assessment:** Fully benign. The score is appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with emphasis on the 'exec' on '_version.py'.  \n- **Findings:** The use of `exec()` on '_version.py' is flagged as a potential risk, since executing code from a file can be malicious if the file is compromised.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.45  \n**Analysis:**  \n- The use of `exec()` is indeed a security concern, as it can execute arbitrary code if '_version.py' is malicious.  \n- However, the report assigns a 'malware' score of 0, which underestimates the risk associated with executing external code.  \n- The 'securityRisk' is set to 0.45, which seems reasonable given the potential for malicious code execution.  \n**Recommendation:**  \n- Increase 'malware' score to at least 0.6 or higher, since executing code from a file can be exploited.  \n- The current 'malware' score of 0 is inconsistent with the identified risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar setup script, again noting the `exec()` on '_version.py'.  \n- **Findings:** The same concern about executing code from a local version file.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2  \n**Analysis:**  \n- The 'securityRisk' is lower here (0.2), but the fundamental issue remains the same.  \n- The 'malware' score remains at 0, which is inconsistent with the risk.  \n**Recommendation:**  \n- Increase 'malware' to at least 0.5, reflecting the potential for malicious code execution.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script, no malicious activity.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, only reading files and executing version info.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0  \n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly identifies no risks. The scores are appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, standard setup script.  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0  \n**Assessment:**  \n- Appropriate and consistent.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- The main concern across multiple reports is the use of `exec()` on '_version.py'. While this is a common pattern in setup scripts, it introduces a potential attack vector if the version file is maliciously modified.  \n- The current malware scores are set to 0 in reports 2 and 3, which understate the risk. Executing code from a file that could be tampered with is a security concern, and the malware score should reflect this.  \n- The 'securityRisk' scores are moderate (around 0.2 to 0.45), which seems reasonable given the context, but the malware score should be higher to align with the potential for code execution.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Justification                                              |\n|----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1        | 0              | 0            | 0              | No issues, benign setup script.                              |\n| 2        | **0.6**        | 0            | **0.45**      | Executing code from '_version.py' poses a real risk.        |\n| 3        | **0.6**        | 0            | 0.2           | Same concern, but lower risk score; should be higher.      |\n| 4        | 0              | 0            | 0              | No issues, benign.                                           |\n| 5        | 0              | 0            | 0              | No issues, benign.                                           |\n\n**Overall Recommendation:**  \n- The 'malware' score for reports 2 and 3 should be increased to at least 0.6 to accurately reflect the potential risk of executing untrusted code via `exec()`.  \n- The 'securityRisk' scores are acceptable but could be slightly increased if desired, but they are less critical than the malware score.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code itself appears standard and benign, the use of `exec()` on local files is a known pattern in setup scripts but should be carefully managed. Ensuring that '_version.py' is securely maintained and not tampered with mitigates this risk.",
