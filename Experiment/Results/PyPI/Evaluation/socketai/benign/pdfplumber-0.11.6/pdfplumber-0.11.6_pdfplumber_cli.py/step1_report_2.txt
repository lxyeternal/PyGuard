  "purpose": "This script processes PDF files to extract and output their structure or content in various formats such as JSON, CSV, or text, based on user-specified command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Input file specified via command-line or stdin; command-line arguments for configuration; external PDF and json modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout, including JSON dumps, CSV data, or text extraction; data from PDF pages and characters are processed but only outputted in benign formats.",
  "flows": "Input data (file and command-line args) → PDF processing (structure extraction, text extraction) → output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard libraries and external modules in a typical manner. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a command-line utility for PDF processing. It parses arguments securely, processes PDF content via an imported PDF module, and outputs data in various formats. No network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration is present. No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are identified. The functions perform standard parsing, data collection, and output formatting without any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for PDF data extraction without any indications of malicious intent or security risks. It handles input and output safely, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
