  "purpose": "A utility to repair PDF files using Ghostscript, supporting various input types and output options.",
  "sources": "File paths, in-memory streams (BytesIO, BufferedReader), environment variables for Ghostscript path.",
  "sinks": "External Ghostscript process, file writing.",
  "flows": "Input data (file path or stream) is passed to Ghostscript via command-line arguments or stdin; output is captured from Ghostscript's stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External process invocation with user input is inherent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code locates Ghostscript dynamically, constructs command-line arguments, and executes it via subprocess. It handles input streams and file paths securely, raising exceptions on failure. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess usage is standard for such utilities, and no network activity or data exfiltration is observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and inherent risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured PDF repair utility leveraging Ghostscript. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities beyond the inherent risks of executing external commands with user-controlled input. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
