  "purpose": "Define the version of the package using a tuple of version components.",
  "sources": "The 'version_info' tuple is a static variable defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The tuple 'version_info' is converted to string and joined to form '__version__'. No external data flows in or out.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version_info tuple with static version numbers. It then joins these numbers into a string to assign to __version__. This is a common pattern for defining package version info. No input, no output, no suspicious code behaviors, or malicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and does not include any dynamic or external operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. It merely assigns a version string based on a predefined tuple.",
