  "purpose": "Define the version string of the module based on a version tuple.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version_info tuple to generate the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the version_info tuple to the __version__ string via join and map functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version_info tuple with static integers, then creates a string __version__ by converting each tuple element to string and joining with periods. This is a common practice for versioning and does not involve any data input or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present, and the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and standard version string assignment, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
