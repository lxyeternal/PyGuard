  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string based on a tuple of version components.",
  "sources": "Static tuple 'version_info' containing version numbers.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to '__version__' string; no untrusted data involved.",
  "flows": "Tuple 'version_info' is converted to string and assigned to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a static tuple with version numbers and joins its elements into a string assigned to '__version__'. There are no inputs, outputs, external data, or dynamic code execution. The code follows standard practices for version declaration in Python packages. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, straightforward code. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and their assessments are appropriate.",
