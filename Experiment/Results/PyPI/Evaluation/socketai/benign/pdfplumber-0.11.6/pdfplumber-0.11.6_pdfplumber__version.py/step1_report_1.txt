  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module using a tuple and string conversion.",
  "sources": "The variable 'version_info' is a hardcoded tuple within the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is used or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code converts 'version_info' to a string and assigns it to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; simple version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple 'version_info' with static version numbers, then joins these into a string assigned to '__version__'. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and standard for defining a package version. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
