  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, no suspicious imports or operations.",
  "analysis": "The code simply initializes a version tuple, then creates a string representation of the version. There are no external data inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no data leaks or malicious operations. The code performs a straightforward operation common in package versioning. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard version assignment logic with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
