  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness**: All reports correctly identify that the code defines a static version tuple and converts it into a string assigned to `__version__`. The original code matches the described logic perfectly.\n\n2. **Malicious behavior and obfuscation**: All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic inputs, no external data, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The code is a standard version declaration.\n\n3. **Security risks**: Since the code only assigns a static version string, there are no apparent security risks. The reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Malware score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Score justification**: The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the analysis. No report suggests any reason to adjust the scores upward.\n\n6. **Potential errors or flaws**: There are no logical errors or flaws in the reasoning of the reports. They all correctly interpret the code as a benign, standard version assignment.\n\n7. **Assumptions about vulnerabilities**: The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly noting that the code is simple and does not involve untrusted data or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\nGiven the simplicity and static nature of the code, I agree with the existing scores. The code is standard practice for defining a package version and poses no security concern.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is a straightforward version declaration.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommended scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0",
