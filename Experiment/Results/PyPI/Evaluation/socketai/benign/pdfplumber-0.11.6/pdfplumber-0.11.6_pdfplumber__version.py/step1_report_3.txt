  "purpose": "Define the version of the module/package as a string based on a version tuple",
  "sources": "The tuple 'version_info' defined at the start of the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code",
  "flows": "Conversion of 'version_info' tuple to string and assignment to '__version__'",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version_info tuple with static version numbers (0, 11, 6). It then creates a string '__version__' by joining the string representations of these numbers with periods. This is a common practice in Python packages to define their version string. There are no input sources, data flows involving untrusted data, or suspicious code patterns present. The code is simple and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It only constructs a version string from a predefined tuple.",
