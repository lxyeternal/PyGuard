{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for data serialization, encoding, and attribute filtering, primarily for PDF and text data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from bytes, PDF objects (PSLiteral, PDFStream), and general data structures (dict, list, tuple). Uses external functions like decode_text.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into system effects; primarily transforms data in-memory.",
  "flows": "Source data (bytes, PDF objects, dicts) is processed through serialization and encoding functions, with safe error handling; no external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the do_bytes method attempts multiple decodings, which is standard practice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module for serialization and encoding, with proper error handling and attribute filtering. It does not perform any network, file system, or system modification operations. The use of decode_text from an external utils module is not suspicious without further context. The do_bytes method's multiple decoding attempts are a common pattern for handling uncertain encodings and are implemented safely. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for data serialization and encoding, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
