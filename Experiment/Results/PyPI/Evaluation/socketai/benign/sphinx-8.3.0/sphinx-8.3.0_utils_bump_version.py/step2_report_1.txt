  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The script manages versioning and changelog updates. No suspicious code, malware, or obfuscation detected. The confidence is high (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is primarily file manipulation for versioning, with no malicious behavior. The low malware score (0) aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk score (0.2) seems slightly conservative but acceptable given the file write operations, which could be misused if files are compromised.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes safe file manipulations, no network activity, no obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior. Confidence is 0.9; malware is 0; security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's operations. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate. The security risk is marginally increased due to file modifications, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The script automates version and changelog updates, with no suspicious code or malicious activity. Confidence is 0.9; malware is 0; security risk is 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low malware score is justified, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The security risk score is very low, reflecting the limited scope of file modifications.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on version bumping and changelog management, no malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation. Confidence is 1; malware is 0; security risk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is clear and aligns with the code's functionality. The malware score of 0 is justified. The security risk score of 0 is appropriate given the lack of external communication or sensitive data handling.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, handles versioning and changelog updates with no malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence is 0.9; malware is 0; security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The malware score remains at 0, which is justified. The security risk score (0.2) is reasonable considering the file modifications.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal potential risk due to file modifications, which is acceptable in this context.\n\n**Final assessment:** The code is a standard, legitimate release management utility with no signs of malicious activity. The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to file write operations, which are expected in such scripts but could be misused if files are compromised.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, and the reports' evaluations are accurate.",
