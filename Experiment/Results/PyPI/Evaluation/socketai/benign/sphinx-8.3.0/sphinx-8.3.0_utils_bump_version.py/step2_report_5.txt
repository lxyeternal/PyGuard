  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script manages versioning and changelog updates, reading/writing files, parsing version strings, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (low, due to file operations)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script performs file modifications related to versioning and changelog management, with no signs of malicious behavior. The low malware score is appropriate. The slight security risk stems from file writes, which are expected in such scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, focusing on version info and changelog updates, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with report 1, the script's operations are standard for release automation. No malicious activity is evident. The security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a version management utility, updating version info and changelog files, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (even lower)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The logic remains straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The minimal security risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on release finalization, version bumping, changelog updates, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Very clear that the script is a standard release management tool. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, handling version and changelog updates, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The script's purpose and operations are consistent with legitimate release management. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code performs version parsing, file updates, and changelog management.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None of the reports detect or suggest any malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** The minimal risk is associated with file write operations, which are expected for such scripts and do not pose significant security threats.\n- **Behavioral analysis:** The code is straightforward, using standard regex, file I/O, and version management logic. No network activity, external data exfiltration, or code injection is observed.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, typical for file-modifying scripts in release workflows)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe script is a legitimate, well-structured release and version management utility. No signs of supply chain attack vectors, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. The low security risk reflects the expected file operations in a controlled release environment.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese are consistent with the detailed reviews provided.",
