  "purpose": "Automates building Sphinx documentation in specified directories and copies the generated search index files to a fixtures directory.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories with 'conf.py' files; external command 'sphinx-build' invoked via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executing 'sphinx-build'; shutil.copy2 copying 'searchindex.js' files.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths derived from directory checks → subprocess executes build command → searchindex.js files copied to fixtures directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; external command execution based on filesystem data, which is controlled.",
  "analysis": "The script identifies project root directories by checking for 'conf.py', then runs 'sphinx-build' via subprocess with controlled parameters, and copies the resulting 'searchindex.js' files. No user input, network activity, or code injection is present. The subprocess call uses filesystem-derived paths, which could be risky if environment is compromised, but in a trusted environment, this is standard. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are detected. The code's behavior is typical for build automation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build automation utility with no malicious intent or behavior. It relies on controlled filesystem paths and external tools. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The overall security posture is safe in a trusted environment.",
