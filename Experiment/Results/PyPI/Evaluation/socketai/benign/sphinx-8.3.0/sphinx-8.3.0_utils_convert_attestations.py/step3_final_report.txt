  "purpose": "Convert Sigstore attestations to PEP 740 format, decode payloads, and verify attestations.",
  "sources": "Reading bundle file bytes, JSON decoding, base64 decoding, command-line arguments for file paths and signer identity.",
  "sinks": "Writing attestation JSON files, printing verification logs, asserting file existence.",
  "flows": "Read bytes from bundle file -> decode JSON -> decode base64 payload -> parse subjects -> create and save attestation -> validate attestation with distribution and identity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' for file existence check; no other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code processes attestations by decoding base64 payloads, converting them into a specific format, and verifying them using external libraries. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'assert' for file existence is a minor code quality concern but not a security issue. External dependencies are standard for attestation handling. The overall logic is straightforward and aligns with legitimate attestation processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for converting and verifying Sigstore attestations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low malware score (0) and risk score (0.2) are justified based on the code's functionality and structure.",
