{
  "purpose": "Convert Sigstore attestations to PEP 740 format and verify attestations using provided identities and distributions.",
  "sources": "Reads input file from sys.argv[1], reads lines as JSON, reads files from disk (DIST / filename), reads attestation JSON from generated files",
  "sinks": "Writing attestation JSON files, printing verification messages, accessing disk files, decoding base64 payloads",
  "flows": "Reads bundle data from input, decodes base64 payload to get subject filenames, processes each filename to create and verify attestations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity or backdoors; reliance on external libraries is typical; straightforward JSON processing and file I/O",
  "analysis": "The code reads a bundle file, processes each line to extract the payload, and converts each subject into a PEP 740 attestation. It performs file existence checks, creates attestations, writes JSON data, and verifies each attestation. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to perform legitimate attestation conversion and validation tasks. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized network access are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed for converting and verifying attestations in a development or CI/CD context. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the code provided. It operates on local files and standard data transformations without any suspicious side effects.",
