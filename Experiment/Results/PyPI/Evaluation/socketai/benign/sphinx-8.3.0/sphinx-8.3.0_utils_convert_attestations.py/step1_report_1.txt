{
  "purpose": "Convert Sigstore attestations to PEP 740 format and verify attestations.",
  "sources": "Reading bundle file from sys.argv[1], reading bytes from the bundle file, reading attestation JSON files from disk, reading environment variables for signer identity.",
  "sinks": "Writing attestation JSON files to disk, printing verification logs, decoding base64 payloads, JSON parsing.",
  "flows": "Read bundle file bytes -> decode base64 payloads -> parse JSON -> convert to Attestation object -> save JSON -> read back for validation -> verify with identity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of environment variables for signer identity is standard, but reliance on command-line argument for file path is noted. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script processes input files, decodes base64 data, and converts JSON representations of attestations, then verifies them. No suspicious code paths, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The script performs expected operations for attestation processing and verification. Use of assertions to check file existence is standard, and the code handles data securely without apparent leaks or malicious data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for converting and verifying Sigstore attestations with no signs of malicious intent. It handles data securely and performs expected functions in the attestation workflow.",
