  "purpose": "Convert Sigstore attestations to PEP 740 format and verify them.",
  "sources": "Reads a bundle file from a path provided via command-line argument; reads JSON lines from the file; reads files from the 'dist' directory; reads contents of attestation files.",
  "sinks": "Writes converted attestation JSON files to the 'dist' directory; outputs verification status to stdout.",
  "flows": "Reads bundle lines -> extracts payload -> decodes base64 -> loads JSON -> processes subjects -> creates and saves attestations -> reads attestations for validation -> verifies attestations using provided identity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code; straightforward use of libraries and data handling. Uses command-line arguments for file paths and identity, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code processes a bundle file line-by-line, extracting payload data and converting it into attestation files in a designated directory. It performs JSON parsing, base64 decoding, and file I/O in a typical manner. It then reads the generated attestation files and validates them using provided identities and distributions. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. The operations are limited to file handling, JSON processing, and library use aligned with attestation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for converting and verifying attestations with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It follows standard data handling practices relevant to its purpose without engaging in malicious activities.",
