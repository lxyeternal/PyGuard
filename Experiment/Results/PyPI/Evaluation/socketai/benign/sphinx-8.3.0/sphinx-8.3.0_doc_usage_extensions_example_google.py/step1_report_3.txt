  "purpose": "The code provides examples of Python docstring formatting, class, function, exception, and attribute documentation following Google style and PEP standards.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input, environment variables, or network data. It defines variables, functions, classes, and docstrings without any data input sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leakage, system commands, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are present; the code solely consists of documentation and class/function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or hidden behaviors detected.",
