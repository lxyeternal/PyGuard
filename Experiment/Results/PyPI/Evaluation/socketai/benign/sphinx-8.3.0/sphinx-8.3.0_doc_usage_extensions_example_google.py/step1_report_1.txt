  "purpose": "This code serves as a comprehensive example and documentation template for Python modules, functions, classes, and attributes following Google Style Guide conventions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, exception initialization, and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that could lead to data leaks, malicious network activity, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters and exception args flow through methods and class attributes, but no external untrusted sources or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The code strictly demonstrates documentation practices with no network, file, or sensitive data handling.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a static example illustrating docstring formats, class and function structures, and attribute annotations. It contains no dynamic or executable code beyond standard class and function definitions. No input or output data sources are connected to external systems. The exception class and property methods are straightforward and serve as documentation examples. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely demonstrative and adheres to documentation standards without any malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat and is safe for use.",
