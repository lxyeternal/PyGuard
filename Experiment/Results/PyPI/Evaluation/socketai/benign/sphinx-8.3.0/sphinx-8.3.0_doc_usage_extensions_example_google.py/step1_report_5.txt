  "purpose": "This code provides examples and templates for documenting Python code following Google Style Guide conventions, including functions, classes, exceptions, and attributes.",
  "sources": "Code reads input through function parameters, class attribute initializations, and property getters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal attribute assignments and function argument processing, with no indication of untrusted data reaching sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code is solely documentation and class/function definitions. No obfuscated language features or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of examples demonstrating Python docstring formatting for functions, classes, exceptions, and attributes, following the Google Style Guide. It includes typical code structure with function signatures, docstrings, type annotations, class attributes, properties, and exception classes. No network operations, file I/O, or data leaks are evident. The code is static documentation examples intended for instructive purposes, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely illustrative documentation code with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a reference for coding style and docstring formatting. There are no signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
