{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an educational example demonstrating Python documentation style following Google Style Guide conventions. It includes functions, classes, attributes, and exception definitions with detailed docstrings, but contains no runtime logic, external data sources, or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it only defines static variables, functions, classes, and attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process or transmit data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static with definitions and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code strictly adheres to documentation standards and contains no suspicious or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive demonstration of Python docstring formatting, class and function documentation, and attribute annotations, following Google Style Guide. It contains no dynamic execution, input/output, or network activity. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's purpose is purely educational and stylistic, with no external dependencies or runtime behavior that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured example of Python documentation practices. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and does not introduce any security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
