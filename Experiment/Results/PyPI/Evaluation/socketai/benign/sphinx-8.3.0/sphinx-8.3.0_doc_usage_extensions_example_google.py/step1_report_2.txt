  "purpose": "This code demonstrates documentation styles for Python, including docstrings, class, function, and attribute documentation, adhering to Google style guide conventions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, class attributes, and exception messages. No external input sources, such as user input or environment variables, are explicitly accessed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, perform network I/O, or write to files. No sensitive data processing or external communication is present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to potential vulnerabilities; the code solely contains documentation and simple class/method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, focusing on documentation examples. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides comprehensive docstring examples for functions, classes, and attributes following Google style. It includes definitions of functions with type annotations, exception classes, and class attribute documentation. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or harmful behaviors. The code is purely illustrative and meant for documentation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of Python documentation styles with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any code or patterns associated with malware, data theft, or malicious activities.",
