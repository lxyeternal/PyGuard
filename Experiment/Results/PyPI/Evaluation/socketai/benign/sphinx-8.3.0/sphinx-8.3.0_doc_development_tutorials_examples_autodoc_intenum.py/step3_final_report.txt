  "purpose": "A Sphinx extension that documents IntEnum classes, adding headers and formatted member listings with optional hexadecimal display.",
  "sources": "Class hierarchy inspection, enum member iteration, options for hex formatting",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Inspection of class subclasses and enum members, formatting output lines",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx extension for documenting IntEnum classes, utilizing safe class introspection and enum member iteration. It adds documentation headers and formatted enum member listings, with an option to display values in hexadecimal. The code does not process untrusted data, perform external calls, or handle secrets. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. The only minor inconsistency is report 5's securityRisk score of 0.1, which should be adjusted to 0, as the code is entirely benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented Sphinx extension with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safety; the small security risk score in report 5 is an overestimation and should be set to zero.",
