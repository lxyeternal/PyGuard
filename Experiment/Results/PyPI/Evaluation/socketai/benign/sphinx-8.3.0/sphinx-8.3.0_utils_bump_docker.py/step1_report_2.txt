{
  "purpose": "The script updates version references in Dockerfiles and tags the corresponding Git repository with the new version.",
  "sources": "User provides version argument via command line; reads Dockerfile contents from specified paths.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to execute Git commands that interact with remote repositories and create tags.",
  "flows": "Input version argument → regex substitution in Dockerfile contents → subprocess.run executing Git commands with version and branch info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of subprocess.run is controlled and only executes predefined Git commands. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution beyond parameterized subprocess call.",
  "analysis": "The script validates the version argument using regex, then updates version strings in specific Dockerfiles by regex substitution. It defines a helper function to run Git commands, which it then uses to checkout, commit, tag, and push to remote repositories. The subprocess calls are straightforward and use controlled parameters, reducing risk of command injection. No external data sources are accessed; all operations are deterministic based on user input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to perform a standard version bump workflow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a version update automation script with no evident malicious behavior. It performs file modifications and Git operations in a controlled manner, with proper validation of inputs. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond normal development workflow. Overall, the script appears safe and legitimate.",
