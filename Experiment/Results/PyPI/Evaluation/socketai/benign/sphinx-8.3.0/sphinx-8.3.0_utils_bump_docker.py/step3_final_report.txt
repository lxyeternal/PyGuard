  "purpose": "Automates updating Dockerfiles with a new version, commits, tags, and pushes changes via git.",
  "sources": "Reads Dockerfile contents, takes version input from command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run to execute git commands with arguments including user-provided version.",
  "flows": "Version input validated with regex, then incorporated into command arguments passed to subprocess without shell invocation.",
  "anomalies": "Potential for command injection if input validation is bypassed or insufficient, but regex validation and list-based subprocess mitigate this risk.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file modifications and git operations, with input validation to ensure version format. Subprocess calls are constructed with argument lists, preventing shell injection unless malicious input bypasses regex. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The main concern is the reliance on regex validation; if the validation is strict and the input is well-formed, the risk of injection is minimal. The code is clear, standard, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version bump automation script with a low security risk primarily related to potential command injection if input validation is compromised. Malware presence is not detected. The overall security risk score should be around 0.2, reflecting minimal residual risk. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0.",
