{
  "purpose": "This script updates version numbers in Dockerfiles and manages Git version control operations such as commit, tag, and push for a project.",
  "sources": "Input comes from command-line argument (the version string). The script reads content from specific Dockerfiles in the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands executed via subprocess.run, specifically Git commands that perform checkout, commit, tagging, and pushing to remote repositories.",
  "flows": "User provides a version string as input -> script updates Dockerfiles -> script executes Git commands to commit, tag, and push changes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The script dynamically updates version strings using safe regex substitutions. No obfuscated code features or suspicious code patterns are observed. The use of subprocess.run is controlled and only executes predefined Git commands.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by validating the input version string against a regex pattern to ensure it is a valid semantic version. It then constructs paths to Dockerfiles and updates the version labels using regex substitutions. The 'git' function wraps subprocess.run to execute Git commands within the DOCKER_ROOT directory. These commands perform standard version control operations: checkout, commit, tag, and push. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, executing arbitrary commands, or connecting to external malicious domains. The script's functionality is straightforward and focused solely on version updates and Git operations, with controlled command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs version updates and Git operations in a controlled manner without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The use of subprocess is limited to predefined Git commands, and no external network connections are made outside of Git interactions. Overall, it appears safe and aligned with typical CI/CD scripting tasks.",
