  "purpose": "This code demonstrates documentation and examples of NumPy-style docstrings, including functions, classes, properties, and exceptions.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input or external data sources. No data is fetched, parsed, or manipulated from external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or vulnerable points where untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; all operations are static and related to documentation structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code strictly defines docstrings, functions, classes, and attributes with no dynamic or unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of docstring examples, function definitions with parameter and return annotations, class definitions with attribute documentation, and exception handling. There is no evidence of code executing external commands, network connections, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The content appears to serve purely educational or documentation purposes. All attributes, functions, and classes follow standard Python conventions, with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive example of NumPy-style docstrings for Python functions, classes, and attributes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely illustrative of documentation standards and best practices.",
