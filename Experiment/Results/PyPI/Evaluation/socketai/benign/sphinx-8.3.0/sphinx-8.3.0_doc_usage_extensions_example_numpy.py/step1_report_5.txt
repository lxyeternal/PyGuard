  "purpose": "The code provides examples and templates for NumPy-style docstrings, demonstrating documentation practices for Python functions, classes, exceptions, and modules.",
  "sources": [
    "Variable assignments (module_level_variable1, module_level_variable2)",
    "Function definitions (function_with_types_in_docstring, function_with_pep484_type_annotations, module_level_function, example_generator)",
    "Class definitions (ExampleError, ExampleClass) and their methods, including __init__, property getters, and other member functions."

  "sinks": [],
  "flows": [],
  "anomalies": "The code contains no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or unusual code patterns. It strictly comprises documentation templates and example functions/classes with no runtime logic or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is entirely focused on illustrating NumPy-style docstring formats for functions, classes, and modules. It includes example parameters, return types, exception documentation, property definitions, and class attributes. There are no dynamic code execution, data input/output, or network activity. All functions are examples with no meaningful logic, and class methods are placeholders or simple property getters. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or other anomalies are present. The initial variables are simple numeric types with inline type annotations, typical for documentation examples.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely illustrative, intended for demonstrating documentation standards. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The absence of runtime logic, data flows, or external interactions indicates it is safe and not intended for malicious purposes.",
