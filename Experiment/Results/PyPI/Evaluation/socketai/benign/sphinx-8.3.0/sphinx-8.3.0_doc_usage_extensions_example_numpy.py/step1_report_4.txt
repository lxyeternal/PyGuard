{
  "purpose": "The provided code appears to be a collection of example functions, classes, and documentation comments demonstrating NumPy style docstrings and documentation practices in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads input and data from function parameters, class attributes, and exception attributes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow from input parameters or attributes into the code's logic, but there are no explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system modification present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters into functions, class attributes, and exception attributes, but there are no evident malicious flow paths targeting external systems or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code is purely demonstrative with no operations that perform data exfiltration, network connections, or system modifications. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of example functions, class definitions, and docstrings illustrating proper documentation style, with no actual operational logic beyond basic parameter handling and property access. It includes exception classes and methods, all standard and benign. There are no signs of malicious code, external data flows, or security risks. All methods and classes serve to demonstrate documentation conventions, with no indication of data leakage, code injection, or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely illustrative, focusing on documentation style and structure, with no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
