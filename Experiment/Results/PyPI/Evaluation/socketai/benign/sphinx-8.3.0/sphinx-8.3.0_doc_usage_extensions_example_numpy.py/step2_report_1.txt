  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of examples demonstrating NumPy-style docstrings, function/class definitions, attributes, and exception documentation.\n- No external data handling, system interaction, or malicious code is reported.\n- The code is purely instructional, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The purpose across all reports is educational/documentational.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are identified; the code matches the descriptions and is consistent with documentation examples.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no network, file, or system operations.\n- **Data flow:** Only within functions/classes, no external or malicious flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 or 0.0.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely illustrative with no malicious payloads, no obfuscated code, no external data handling, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep at **0**.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports indicate no obfuscation (scores of 0 or 0.0).\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and clear.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep at **0**.\n\n#### Risk Score:\n- All reports assign a very low or zero risk score (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n- **Justification:** Since there's no malicious activity, no external data leaks, or security flaws, the risk is minimal.\n- **However:** The reports are consistent with the code being purely educational/documentational, so a risk score of **0** or **0.1** is appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep at **0** or **0.1**.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Checks:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, purely documentation-focused.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n- The scores align with the described nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- Given the code's purpose as an educational example of NumPy-style docstrings, the absence of any runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious payloads justifies a **malware score of 0**.\n- The obfuscated score remains **0** as there's no obfuscation.\n- The risk score remains **0** because the code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis, confirming the code's safety and benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard, well-structured educational example with no malicious or risky elements. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
