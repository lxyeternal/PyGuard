{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an educational example demonstrating NumPy-style docstrings, function and class documentation, and exception handling in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only from function parameters and class attributes; no external data sources or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal parameter passing within functions and class methods; no external or malicious data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of illustrative examples for documentation purposes, including functions, classes, attributes, and exception classes. It does not process external data, perform I/O, or execute any system commands. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0) are consistent with the code's benign and educational nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a documentation template or educational resource. It contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
