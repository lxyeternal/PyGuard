  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as an educational or documentation example, focusing on NumPy-style docstrings, function signatures, class structures, and exception handling.\n- No report indicates any external data input, output, or interaction.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected: no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, network operations, or data leaks.\n- The code's purpose appears solely to demonstrate documentation standards.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** The code is purely illustrative. There are no functional issues, security vulnerabilities, or malicious code segments. The code is consistent with its purpose.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. The malware score should be 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation present. Obfuscated score should be 0.\n- **Risks:** Given the nature of the code, the overall security risk is negligible, score should be 0.\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n- The scores assigned in each report are all 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The purpose of the code is explicitly educational/documentational, not operational or data-processing.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary; the scores seem appropriate.\n- The detailed descriptions correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is purely illustrative, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the purpose of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard example of NumPy-style docstrings and class/function structures, intended for documentation or educational purposes. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores provided in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
