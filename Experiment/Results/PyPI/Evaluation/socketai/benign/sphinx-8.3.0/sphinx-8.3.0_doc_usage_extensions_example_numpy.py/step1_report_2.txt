{
  "purpose": "This module provides examples and documentation styles for NumPy docstrings, demonstrating various formats and conventions for documenting Python functions, classes, attributes, and exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class attributes, and exception initializers. It also includes docstrings as metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in the code that process untrusted data or perform data leaks. No network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code does not include data flow from sources to sinks; it is purely illustrative of documentation standards and class structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code is well-structured and solely focused on documentation examples.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions, a class, and an exception class, all implementing standard Python documentation practices for NumPy style docstrings. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The class attributes, functions, and exception initializers follow typical patterns. There are no network operations, data leaks, or obfuscated constructs. The code's purpose is educational, and it contains no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely educational and demonstrates documentation styles without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and review.",
