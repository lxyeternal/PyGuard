  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward localization utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) reflect minimal inherent risks associated with filesystem and environment variable usage, which are typical in such scripts."
