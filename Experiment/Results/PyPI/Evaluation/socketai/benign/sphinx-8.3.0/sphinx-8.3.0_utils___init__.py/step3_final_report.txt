  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input functions, environment variables, file reads, network interactions, system commands, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, subprocess calls, environment variables, data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment, files) to sinks (network, files, system commands) via code execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), obfuscated variable names, incomplete code, lack of input validation, suspicious network routines, hidden routines, inconsistent code completeness.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate no concrete malicious patterns such as backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious network activity. Reports noting dynamic execution or obfuscation are cautious but lack definitive evidence. Scores are generally low, reflecting minimal malicious suspicion, with some reports assigning moderate obfuscation and risk scores due to potential concerns. The confidence levels vary but are mostly high when code appears benign. The incomplete or absent code in some reports limits definitive conclusions. Overall, the assessments are consistent, with slight adjustments suggested for Report 1's malware score to reflect the mention of dynamic execution functions, but remaining within a low suspicion range.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign overall, with no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are appropriate given the evidence, with minor concerns about obfuscation and dynamic code features. No significant revisions are necessary; the threat level remains low.",
