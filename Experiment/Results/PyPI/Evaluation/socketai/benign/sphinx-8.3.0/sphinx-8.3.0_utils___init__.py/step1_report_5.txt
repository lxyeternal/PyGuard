  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose cannot be fully determined due to lack of comments or context.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function arguments, environment variables, or external files (if any are present). No explicit data sources are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data could potentially be written to files, printed to stdout, or sent over network connections if such code exists. No explicit sinks are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Unclear without specific function calls or data handling logic; likely involves passing input through functions or modules, but no concrete source-to-sink paths are observable.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks identifiable malicious patterns or security issues. It doesn't include external data handling, network communication, or credential management. The absence of comments and context limits full assessment, but nothing suspicious is evident from the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard, with no indications of malware or obfuscation.",
