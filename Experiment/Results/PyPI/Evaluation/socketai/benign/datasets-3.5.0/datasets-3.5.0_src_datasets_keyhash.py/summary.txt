  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for dataset key hashing with minor cryptographic weakness due to MD5. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2 due to MD5's weakness, which does not imply malicious intent."
