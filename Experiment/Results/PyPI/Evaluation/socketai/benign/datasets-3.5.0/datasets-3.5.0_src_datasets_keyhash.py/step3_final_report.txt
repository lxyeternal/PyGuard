  "purpose": "Utility for hashing dataset keys using MD5, supporting multiple input types and salting with split name to avoid hash collisions across splits.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'hash_salt' for salting, 'key' for hashing, and the external dependency 'insecure_hashlib.md5'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; the function outputs an integer hash value.",
  "flows": "Input 'hash_salt' is converted to bytes, used to initialize MD5 hash object; 'key' is converted to bytes and fed into the hash; the final hash digest is converted to an integer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. Use of 'insecure_hashlib.md5' suggests weak cryptography but not malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard hashing utility with proper input validation and error handling. It supports string, integer, and byte inputs, converting them appropriately. The use of MD5 via 'insecure_hashlib' is noted; while MD5 is cryptographically weak, its use here for dataset key hashing is acceptable. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The error handling for invalid types is appropriate, and the code is clear and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for dataset key hashing with minor cryptographic weakness due to MD5. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2 due to MD5's weakness, which does not imply malicious intent.",
