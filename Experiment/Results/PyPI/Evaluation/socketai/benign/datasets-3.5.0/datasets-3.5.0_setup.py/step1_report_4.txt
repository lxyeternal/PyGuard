{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'datasets' Python package, specifying dependencies, package metadata, and build instructions.",
  "sources": "The code reads package requirements, package data, and version information. It also reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the setup script primarily handles package configuration. No untrusted data is used in a way that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The script flows from importing modules, defining dependency lists, reading the README file, and calling setup() to configure the package build.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code follows standard setup.py structure with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines dependency lists with specific version constraints, and configures package metadata. The dependencies are clearly specified, and the README is loaded safely. No user input or untrusted data sources are incorporated dynamically. The structure is typical for a Python package setup file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a legitimate configuration file for building and distributing the 'datasets' package. It contains no malicious code or supply chain security risks. It adheres to standard practices and does not exhibit any signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
