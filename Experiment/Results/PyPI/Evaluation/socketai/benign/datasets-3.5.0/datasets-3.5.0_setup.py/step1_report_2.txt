{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'datasets' Python package, including dependencies, package metadata, and build instructions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the README.md file for the long description. Dependencies are specified directly in the script. No user input or external data is processed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in security-sensitive contexts. The setup script executes only static configuration code, with no external data handling or command execution.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The setup process is static and standard, with no source-to-sink data paths that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The script uses standard setuptools functions and static lists of dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains package configuration data, including dependency lists, package metadata, and setup parameters. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or network operations are present. The dependencies are explicitly listed with version constraints, and the code relies on standard setuptools functions for package setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated/malicious code. It is a benign, standard package setup script with static content and no malicious signals.",
