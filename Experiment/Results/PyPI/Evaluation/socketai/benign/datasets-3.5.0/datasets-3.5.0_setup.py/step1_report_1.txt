  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'datasets' Python package, including dependency management and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools; hardcoded package dependencies; version strings; metadata fields; long description read from README.md.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; static package metadata and dependencies are hardcoded, no dynamic execution or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No dynamic data flow; static configuration and package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. All dependencies and metadata appear standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python library. It specifies dependencies, package data, and metadata without any dynamic or malicious code. The dependencies are well-formed, and there are no indications of code injection, network calls, or hidden backdoors. The long description is read from a file, which is common practice. No suspicious code or behavior was identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
