{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'datasets' Python package, including dependencies, package metadata, and configuration for building and distribution.",
  "sources": "Package dependencies, configuration parameters, and setup instructions within the setup.py file.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of arbitrary code during setup (e.g., reading files, installing dependencies), but no direct untrusted data sinks or network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content during setup, defining dependencies, and configuring package data. No flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic observed. Setup process is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package, specifying dependencies, metadata, and package configuration. It reads the README.md for the long description, defines dependencies and extras, and sets up packaging instructions. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The only operations are file reading, dependency declaration, and package configuration, which are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package setup file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly performs package configuration and dependency management, typical for Python distribution scripts.",
