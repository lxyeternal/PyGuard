{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'datasets' Python library, specifying dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Imports (setuptools), dependency lists, setup() function parameters, and versioning information.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function which initiates package installation and dependency installation.",
  "flows": "The code initializes dependency lists, then executes setup() which uses these dependencies during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The code primarily contains dependency definitions and standard setup procedures. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution. All dependencies appear appropriate for the package's purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'find_packages' and 'setup' from setuptools. It defines various dependency lists for core requirements, optional extras, testing, documentation, and more. The dependencies include version constraints and environment markers, but no suspicious or unnecessary dynamic behaviors. The setup() call specifies package metadata, dependencies, package data, entry points, classifiers, and other configuration options. There are no signs of malicious code such as network calls, system modifications, or data leaks. The code is consistent with a typical, legitimate Python package setup script. All dependencies are standard for such a package, and there are no anomalies that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It properly defines dependencies and package configuration. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns present.",
