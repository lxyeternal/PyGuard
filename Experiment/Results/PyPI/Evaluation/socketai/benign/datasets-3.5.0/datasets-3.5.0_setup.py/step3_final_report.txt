  "purpose": "Configuration script for packaging the 'datasets' Python library, defining dependencies, metadata, and setup parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static dependency lists, package metadata declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network calls, no dynamic code execution or user input handling.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data used during package setup; no runtime data flows or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script for packaging a Python library, with explicit dependencies and metadata. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated logic. All dependency versions are explicitly constrained, and the script performs static configuration only. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and static nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0, consistent with the code's characteristics.",
