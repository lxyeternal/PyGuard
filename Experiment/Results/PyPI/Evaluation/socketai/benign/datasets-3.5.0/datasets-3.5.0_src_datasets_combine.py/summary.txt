  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured dataset utility module with no security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (0.1 to reflect potential untrusted dataset sources, but no malicious activity). The high confidence scores across reports are justified given the code's clarity and validation."
