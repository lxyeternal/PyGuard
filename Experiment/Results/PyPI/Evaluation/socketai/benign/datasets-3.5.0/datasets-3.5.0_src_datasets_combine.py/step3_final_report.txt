  "purpose": "Functions for interleaving and concatenating datasets with validation and delegation to internal processing functions.",
  "sources": "Dataset inputs, parameters for probabilities, seed, info, split, stopping strategy.",
  "sinks": "Internal dataset processing functions; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Validation of datasets -> delegation to internal functions (_interleave_map_style_datasets, etc.)",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs thorough input validation, type checks, and delegates processing to internal functions. It does not perform external network or file operations, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code. The functions are standard dataset utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured dataset utility module with no security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (0.1 to reflect potential untrusted dataset sources, but no malicious activity). The high confidence scores across reports are justified given the code's clarity and validation.",
