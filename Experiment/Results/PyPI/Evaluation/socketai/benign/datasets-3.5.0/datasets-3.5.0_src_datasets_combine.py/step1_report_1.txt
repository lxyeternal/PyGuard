  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to interleave and concatenate datasets, supporting both map-style and iterable datasets, with configurable options for probabilities, seed, info, split, and stopping strategy.",
  "sources": "Inputs include dataset lists (`datasets`, `dsets`) provided by the user, and dataset parameters such as `probabilities`, `seed`, `info`, `split`, and `axis`. It reads dataset objects and their attributes, as well as optional configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flow could involve `probabilities` and `seed` influencing dataset sampling; however, these are used internally for controlled random selection. Dataset objects are returned but there are no evident sinks that transmit untrusted data externally, such as network operations or file writes. No data leaks, credential use, or external data transmission are present.",
  "flows": "Input datasets are validated for type and consistency, then passed to internal functions (`_interleave_map_style_datasets`, `_interleave_iterable_datasets`, `_concatenate_map_style_datasets`, `_concatenate_iterable_datasets`). Probabilities and seed influence the internal sampling process for interleaving. No external or network interactions occur. Data flows from input datasets through validation, into internal processing functions, and finally outputs combined datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns, are evident. The code performs standard dataset validation and combination. No obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for interleaving and concatenating datasets with extensive input validation to ensure dataset types and consistency. It supports both map-style and iterable datasets, with options for probabilistic sampling and stopping strategies. All validation steps are standard, with clear error messages. Internal functions called are imported modules, likely implemented in Cython or C++ for efficiency, but their details are not provided here. The functions do not perform external network calls, file writes, or system modifications. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be well-structured, focused on dataset management with rigorous validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data leaks. It is a legitimate utility module for dataset processing with no security concerns identified.",
