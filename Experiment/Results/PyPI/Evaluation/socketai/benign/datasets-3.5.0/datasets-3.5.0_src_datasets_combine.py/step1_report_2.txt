{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interleave and concatenate datasets, primarily for data processing pipelines involving map-style and iterable datasets.",
  "sources": "Inputs include datasets lists, probabilities, seed, info, and split parameters. Datasets are passed as arguments to functions; datasets are checked for their type and content.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could originate from datasets being passed into functions, especially if datasets are constructed or sourced externally. No direct sinks for data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset inputs through validation checks, then to internal functions (_interleave_map_style_datasets, _interleave_iterable_datasets, _concatenate_map_style_datasets, _concatenate_iterable_datasets) which process and return datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic, are evident. All operations are standard dataset handling procedures. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation to ensure datasets are of expected types and structures, raising errors for invalid or empty datasets. It uses internal functions to process datasets based on their type (map-style or iterable). There are no indications of malicious behavior or code injection. The code relies on established data processing logic and external functions for dataset manipulation. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious constructs. The use of logging is standard for debugging and informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured dataset utility for interleaving and concatenating datasets, with proper validation and no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
