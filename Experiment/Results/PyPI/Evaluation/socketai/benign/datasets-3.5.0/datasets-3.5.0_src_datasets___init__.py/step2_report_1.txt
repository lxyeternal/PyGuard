  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence and reasoning provided.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is purely licensing comments and import statements from internal modules. No functions, data processing, or external communication.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate, as this is standard library setup code.  \n- **Confidence:** High (1).  \n**Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the use of wildcard imports.  \n- **Findings:** Wildcard imports can sometimes hide unwanted code, but are common in package `__init__.py` files. No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.1 due to wildcard imports, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.  \n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9) but still high.  \n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious intent or security risk evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, with focus on import statements and use of wildcard imports.  \n- **Findings:** No network activity, no data leakage, no obfuscated code.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 due to wildcard imports, which is acceptable in this context.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9.  \n**Conclusion:** Reasonable assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no runtime logic or external actions.  \n- **Findings:** Standard import module, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n**Conclusion:** Correct; benign code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard package initialization.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or security issues.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.  \n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard package setup with import statements, licensing info, and versioning.  \n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.  \n- Wildcard imports are typical in package `__init__.py` files, though they can sometimes hide unwanted code, but this is not a security concern here.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 at most, due to wildcard imports, but this is standard practice and not a real security risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard imports, but acceptable)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the overall security posture is safe.",
