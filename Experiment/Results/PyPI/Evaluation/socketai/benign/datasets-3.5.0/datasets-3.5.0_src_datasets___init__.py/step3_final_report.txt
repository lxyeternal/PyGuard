{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the initialization module for the HuggingFace datasets library, importing various components and setting up the package environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules and licensing comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; no network or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules at startup; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (e.g., 'from .download import *') which can obscure imported objects but are common in package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments, version info, and import statements. No executable functions, data processing, or external communication. Wildcard imports are standard in package initializers but could hide unwanted code; however, no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard imports is standard in this context and does not pose a security risk. Overall, the package initialization code is safe.",
