  "purpose": "This code is part of the HuggingFace Datasets library, intended for dataset management, loading, and processing.",
  "sources": "Imports various modules and functions from local files and submodules, and sets version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points identified. No external network or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; primarily imports and definitions with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. All import statements are standard for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of license headers, version declaration, and a series of import statements from local modules within the package. There is no dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious logic. All imported modules are typical for a dataset management library. No source-to-sink data flows or anomalous behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization script for the HuggingFace Datasets library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. No suspicious activity or security issues detected.",
