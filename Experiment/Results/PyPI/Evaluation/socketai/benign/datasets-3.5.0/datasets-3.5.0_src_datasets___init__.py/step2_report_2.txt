  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is purely import statements and licensing comments, standard for a library setup.\n- **Findings:** No executable logic, no untrusted data handling, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified; no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** This report is accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** The code is part of an `__init__.py` for a dataset library, with imports from internal modules.\n- **Findings:** Uses wildcard imports (`from .download import *`, etc.), which can be considered less explicit but are common in package initializers.\n- **Potential concerns:** Wildcard imports can hide imported objects, but in the context of a package's `__init__.py`, this is standard practice.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — perhaps a slight concern due to wildcard imports, but overall very low.\n\n**Justification:** The code is a typical package initializer. Wildcard imports are not inherently malicious but could hide unwanted code. However, in open source package setup, this is common and not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no malware or malicious intent is evident. The minor security risk score is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard package `__init__.py` with imports.\n- **Findings:** Wildcard imports again, but no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor concern due to wildcard imports, but standard practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct assessment. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard import module for a dataset library.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no external network calls, no data leaks.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup with imports and version info.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no network activity, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are accurate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to wildcard imports, but in context, this is standard practice and not indicative of security risk.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, standard import statements.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no real security risk; minor concerns about wildcard imports are typical and do not constitute a threat.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign module initialization for a dataset library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
