  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is purely import statements, licensing comments, and version info.\n- No functions, classes, or executable logic that process data or perform actions.\n- Wildcard imports are used in some cases, which can be a minor concern but are common in __init__.py files.\n- No network activity, external calls, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Correctly identifies that the code is just import statements and licensing.\n- Finds no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- Security risk score: 0, malware score: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n- Accurate; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, notes standard package initialization.\n- Slightly mentions wildcard imports as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- Security risk: 0.1, malware: 0, confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n\n- The 0.1 security risk is due to wildcard imports, which can sometimes hide unwanted code, but in package init files, this is common practice.\n- Malware score remains 0, as no malicious activity is observed.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n- Reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same conclusion: standard package __init__.py pattern.\n- Wildcard imports are noted but considered typical.\n- No malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Security risk: 0.1, malware: 0, confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n- Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same as above: standard import module, no suspicious activity.\n- No anomalies or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- Security risk: 0, malware: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n- Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Same conclusion: benign, standard import code.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- All zero or minimal risk.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\n- Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some (0.1) due to wildcard imports, which is acceptable and common in package init files.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1, mainly due to wildcard imports, which are standard in such files but could theoretically hide unwanted code.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the code's nature. No security risks or malware are present. The minor wildcard import concern does not constitute a real security threat here.\n\n---\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in the reports align well with the actual code content.",
