  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing datasets on Hugging Face Hub, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily due to the handling of tokens and remote code trust flags, but these are standard practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk."
