  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for dataset management errors, with a method to generate detailed error messages involving path resolution.",
  "sources": "Path resolution via HfFileSystem in from_cast_error method, exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external commands, or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with standard path resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions for dataset errors, with a single method that constructs error messages by resolving file paths using HfFileSystem. There is no processing of untrusted input, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The path resolution is used solely for informative error messages within the context of dataset management. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The external library usage is standard and safe. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to best practices for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of dataset error classes with path resolution for error messages. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should all be 0.",
