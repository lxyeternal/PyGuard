  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the dataset processing library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read in this code; only class definitions and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward class and method definitions with no external data handling or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes for error handling in a dataset management context, including methods that resolve paths and generate detailed error messages. It uses standard Python features, external library calls for path resolution, and no data leaks, network operations, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be well-structured and intended solely for error handling, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining error classes and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
