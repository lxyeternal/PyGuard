{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for dataset handling and errors in the HuggingFace dataset processing library.",
  "sources": "No input or untrusted data sources; exception classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; exception handling code does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; mainly class definitions and error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; uses standard exception patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions related to dataset errors. It includes a class method that constructs an exception message with detailed information, including resolving paths using the huggingface_hub's HfFileSystem. The method involves path resolution and string formatting but relies on external functions and configurations. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be standard for error handling within a dataset library, with no external or untrusted data processing present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions with a method for detailed error messaging, using external libraries for path resolution. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; it is a standard error handling module.",
