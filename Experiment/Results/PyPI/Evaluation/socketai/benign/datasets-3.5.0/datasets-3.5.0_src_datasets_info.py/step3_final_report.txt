{
  "purpose": "Management and serialization of dataset metadata, including reading/writing JSON, YAML, and dataset cards, merging dataset info, and handling dataset splits and features.",
  "sources": "File system reads for JSON, YAML, dataset card files; data loaded into data classes; external modules like fsspec and huggingface_hub used for file access and dataset card handling.",
  "sinks": "Writes JSON, YAML, and license files; updates dataset card data; outputs dataset info files to specified directories.",
  "flows": "Reads dataset info from files into data classes; processes and merges info; writes updated info back to files; no untrusted data flows into code execution or network activities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns detected. Uses standard, well-known libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dataset metadata management with controlled file I/O, serialization, and deserialization. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External modules are used appropriately for file system abstraction and dataset card handling. Data flows are predictable and involve only trusted file sources. No signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, code injection, or credential theft. The code is purpose-driven, well-structured, and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, purpose-specific, and free of malicious intent. It employs standard practices for dataset info management without obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is effectively zero.",
