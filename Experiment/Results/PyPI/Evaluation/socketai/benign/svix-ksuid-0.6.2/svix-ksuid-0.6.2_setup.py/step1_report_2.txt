{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package called 'svix-ksuid', used to facilitate packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or used in a way that affects execution or data security.",
  "flows": "The README file content flows into the 'long_description' parameter of setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard setup script conventions are followed. No hardcoded credentials or external connections.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads a local README file to include as the long description, adjusts the current working directory to ensure correct path resolution, and invokes setuptools.setup() with standard arguments. There are no dynamic code executions, external data fetching, or other suspicious behaviors. All operations are typical for a Python packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
