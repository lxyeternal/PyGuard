{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'svix-ksuid', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing os and setuptools modules, and executing os.chdir for directory navigation.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the script primarily reads local files and sets up package metadata without executing untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Setting current working directory -> Running setup() to define package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The script functions as a typical setup.py file.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing standard modules (os, setuptools) for package setup. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author, URL, and dependencies. It reads the README.md file content into a variable. The current working directory is adjusted to ensure relative paths are correct. The setup() function is called with all necessary parameters to prepare the package for distribution. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup.py script used for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
