  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'svix-ksuid' Python library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; obtaining package data; importing os and setuptools modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only reads a local file and sets package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, sets package metadata, reads a local README file, and configures setup parameters. It modifies the current working directory to the script's directory to ensure relative paths work correctly. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears to be a straightforward, conventional setup file for Python packaging with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a typical, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
