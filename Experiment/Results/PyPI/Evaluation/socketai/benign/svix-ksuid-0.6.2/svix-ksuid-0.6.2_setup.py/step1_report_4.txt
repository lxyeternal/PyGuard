  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'svix-ksuid'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, os.path functions for directory and file path manipulations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data leakage, network calls, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reads local file (README.md), sets current working directory, then runs setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code. Usage of standard setup tools and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup activities: importing modules, defining package metadata, reading a local README file, adjusting the working directory, and invoking setup(). No input from untrusted sources, no network or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves purely as a packaging utility without any malicious intent.",
