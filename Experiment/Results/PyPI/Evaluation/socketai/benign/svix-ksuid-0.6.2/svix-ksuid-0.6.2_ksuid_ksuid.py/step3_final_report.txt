  "purpose": "Implementation of KSUID and KSUID with millisecond precision classes for generating time-ordered unique IDs using cryptographically secure payloads and base62 encoding.",
  "sources": "secrets.token_bytes for payload generation, datetime.now for timestamping, base62.decode for decoding, and internal byte slices for timestamp extraction.",
  "sinks": "Base62 string representation of the ID, internal byte array for timestamp and payload extraction.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (datetime, payload) to internal byte array; internal byte array to base62 string; byte array to timestamp and payload properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity. Proper length checks and secure payload generation are used.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, secure practices for generating KSUIDs with high confidence. Payloads are generated securely using secrets.token_bytes, timestamps are calculated correctly relative to a custom epoch, and encoding/decoding is handled via a well-known library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code structure is clear, and the logic aligns with best practices for such ID generation. Minor variations in security risk scores across reports are justified by the inherent minimal risk in ID generation without external exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of KSUIDs with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores in the reports are accurate; all indicate no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The overall assessment confirms the supply chain safety of this dependency.",
