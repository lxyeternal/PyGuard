{
  "purpose": "This code is exporting specific classes and exceptions related to KSUIDs (K-Sortable Unique Identifiers) for use in other modules or packages.",
  "sources": "The code imports components from a local module named .ksuid",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only defines exports",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing imports and exports, with no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and an exception from a local module, then explicitly defines the public API using __all__. There are no data processing, input/output handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code structure is straightforward, focusing on modular exports. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module that exposes classes and exceptions related to KSUIDs. It contains no malware, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard part of a larger package intended for ID generation or manipulation.",
