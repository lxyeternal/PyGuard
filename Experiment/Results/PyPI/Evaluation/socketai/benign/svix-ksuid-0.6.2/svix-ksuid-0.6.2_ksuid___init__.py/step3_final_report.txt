  "purpose": "Re-export specific classes and exceptions from the local 'ksuid' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .ksuid module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flow",
  "flows": "Import from .ksuid → export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components from a local module and exposes them via __all__, serving as an interface. It contains no data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code's simplicity indicates no security risks or malware potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module interface with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
