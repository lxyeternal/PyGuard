  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes/exceptions from a local 'ksuid' module and re-exports them via `__all__`.\n   - The code snippet itself contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and does not contain issues or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n   - They correctly interpret the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and provide reasonable conclusions.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Risk Score > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a malware and security risk score of 0, and the code is purely re-exporting symbols without any suspicious activity, this is justified.\n   - No higher risk scores are warranted based solely on this snippet.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No signs of backdoors, malicious payloads, or obfuscated malware.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - The assumption that re-exporting classes from a local module is benign is correct here.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a simple, benign module interface with no security concerns.**",
