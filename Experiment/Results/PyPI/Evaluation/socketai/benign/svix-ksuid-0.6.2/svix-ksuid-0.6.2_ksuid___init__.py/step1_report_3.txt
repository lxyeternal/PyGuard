{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports specific classes and exceptions from the 'ksuid' module, likely related to generating or handling KSUIDs (K-Sortable Unique Identifiers).",
  "sources": "The code imports components ('ByteArrayLengthException', 'Ksuid', 'KsuidMs') from a local module '.ksuid'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or external communication within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module to the exported list, but no untrusted input or data manipulation occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward module interface with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple import statement from a local module and an '__all__' declaration to specify exported names. It does not process input, execute code dynamically, or perform any network or file operations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present. It is a typical Python module interface pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard, benign module interface that exports certain classes and exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this code alone.",
