  "purpose": "Implement a character-level RNN language model for training, sampling, and saving/loading models.",
  "sources": "Reading corpus data, model parameters, and lookup tables; input tokens during training and sampling.",
  "sinks": "Model file storage on disk; no external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from corpus to model for training; model parameters are saved/loaded locally; sampling generates text based on learned probabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard libraries and routines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard character-level RNN (LSTM or SimpleRNN) for language modeling. It reads corpus data, builds vocab, trains the model with stochastic gradient descent, and samples text. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The sampling uses Python's 'random' module, which is benign in this context. The model's save/load functions are typical for ML workflows. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious routines are detected. The code's structure and data flow are straightforward and consistent with benign ML training scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign character-level RNN language modeling script with no malicious intent or behavior. The security risk is minimal, and no malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects the benign nature of the code.",
