  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script automates building dyNET, fetching Eigen, configuring, and compiling. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering the nature of build scripts.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in the assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency download, configuration, and build process. Notes potential risks from external commands and network fetches but finds no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — slightly higher, reflecting the potential risks of external fetch and command execution, but still low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights fetching Eigen via URL, extraction, build steps, and macOS-specific modifications. Recognizes the lack of malicious code but notes the risk of unvalidated downloads.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — aligns with the standard build process and the absence of malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing dependency fetching, build steps, and potential risks from external commands and downloads. No malicious code found.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern — dependency download, build, configuration, with no signs of malicious activity. Recognizes standard build procedures.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2–0.3) due to the inherent risks in executing external commands and downloading dependencies, but these are standard for build scripts and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### My Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, considering the potential vulnerabilities introduced by external fetches and subprocess calls, but typical for build systems.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is a legitimate build script with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the reliance on external URLs and command execution, which is standard but should be trusted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Final Estimate |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0              |\n| Obfuscated   | 0              |\n| Risk         | 0.2            |\n\nThe overall security posture of this code is low risk, assuming the external sources are trustworthy.",
