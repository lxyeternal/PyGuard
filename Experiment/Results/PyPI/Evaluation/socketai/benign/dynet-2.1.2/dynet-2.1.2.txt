      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and installation tool with low security risk. It performs expected tasks for building a complex library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The potential vulnerabilities relate to external dependency fetches and command execution without validation, which are common in build systems but should be used with trusted sources. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
