      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor risk relates to the runtime execution of the CLI command, which is common for CLI tools and outside the scope of static analysis. Therefore, malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential runtime behavior, but the setup code itself is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard automation framework for energy simulation workflows with no malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate; malware score is low (0.1), obfuscation absent (0), and security risk moderate (~0.4) due to external process calls and embedded secrets. Minor improvements include input validation and avoiding hardcoded secrets, but overall, the code is safe from malicious activity."

The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects routine file and directory management routines. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, consistent with the code's transparency and purpose."

The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. Minor concerns about assertions are operational rather than security issues. Overall, the supply chain appears secure, and the code is safe for use."
