{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the Python package 'dragonfly-energy' with metadata, dependencies, and entry points for CLI execution.",
  "sources": "Reads static files ('README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'standards-requirements.txt') and defines package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations beyond static file reading; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static file contents flow into setup configuration; entry point 'dragonfly_energy.cli:energy' is registered for CLI but not executed here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and adheres to standard package setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static documentation and dependency files, then calls setuptools.setup() with standard parameters. The only point of potential runtime concern is the CLI entry point 'dragonfly_energy.cli:energy', which could execute arbitrary code when invoked, but this is outside the static setup script. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The setup script itself is benign and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor risk relates to the runtime execution of the CLI command, which is common for CLI tools and outside the scope of static analysis. Therefore, malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential runtime behavior, but the setup code itself is safe.",
