{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'dragonfly-energy', managing dependencies, package info, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading files: 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'standards-requirements.txt'; package metadata provided directly in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into variables (long_description, requirements, standards_requirements) which are used in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code performs standard setup tasks without suspicious constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files for package description and requirements, then calls setuptools.setup() with typical parameters. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input processing, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The setup process appears conventional, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
