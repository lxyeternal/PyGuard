  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'dragonfly-energy', including reading dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, requirements.txt, standards-requirements.txt for descriptions and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Uses setup() to define package configuration; no direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system modification operations.",
  "flows": "Reads external files into variables and passes them to setuptools.setup(), with no further processing or data flow manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code; standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads external documentation and dependency files, and configures package metadata and requirements. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No code injection, insecure handling, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical and legitimate setup configuration for a Python package. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
