  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor risk relates to the runtime execution of the CLI command, which is common for CLI tools and outside the scope of static analysis. Therefore, malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential runtime behavior, but the setup code itself is safe."
