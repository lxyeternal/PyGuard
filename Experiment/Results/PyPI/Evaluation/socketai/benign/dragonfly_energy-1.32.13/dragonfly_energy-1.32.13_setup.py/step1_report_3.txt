{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'dragonfly-energy' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, 'requirements.txt' and 'standards-requirements.txt' for dependencies, and package data via setuptools.find_packages.",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies, package data inclusion, and console script entry point.",
  "flows": "Reading files (sources) to configure package setup, which results in installed package and console script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward setup script with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. It reads dependencies and description files, then configures setuptools parameters accordingly. The console script points to a likely legitimate function 'dragonfly_energy.cli:energy'. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. All operations are typical for open-source package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It follows common packaging practices and contains no suspicious behavior.",
