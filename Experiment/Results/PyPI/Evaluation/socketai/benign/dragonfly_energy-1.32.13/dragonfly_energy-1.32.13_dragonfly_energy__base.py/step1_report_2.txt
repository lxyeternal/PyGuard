{
  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for GeoJSON geometry objects, providing methods for geometry manipulation, conversion from geoJSON data, and object duplication.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'identifier' during initialization, geojson_coordinates in static conversion methods, and method arguments such as 'angle', 'origin', 'plane', 'factor', 'moving_vec'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or harmful effects are present; the code does not execute external commands, write files, or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (geojson_coordinates, identifiers, transformation parameters) into conversion functions that produce geometry objects; these objects can then be moved, rotated, reflected, or scaled.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Assertions are used for validation but are standard practice. The code relies on external libraries for geometry but does not execute external code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class for geometry objects with methods for manipulation and conversion. It performs validation and type checks but does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to code injection or data exfiltration. The static methods convert geoJSON coordinates into geometry objects using external libraries and do not perform network operations or system calls. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of geometry handling, conversion, and manipulation without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or dangerous vulnerabilities based on the analyzed content.",
