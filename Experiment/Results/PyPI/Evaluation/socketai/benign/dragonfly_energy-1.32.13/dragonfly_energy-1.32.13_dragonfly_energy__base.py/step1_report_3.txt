{
  "purpose": "This code provides a base class for GeoJSON geometry objects, enabling transformation and conversion of geographic data, primarily for visualization or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters such as 'identifier', 'geojson_coordinates', 'origin_lon_lat', 'convert_facs', and object properties.",
  "sinks": "Transforms data through geometry operations like move, rotate, reflect, and scale; uses external libraries for geometry manipulations; no direct data sink or output functions evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., geojson coordinates, identifiers) flows through conversion functions to generate geometry objects; geometry operations modify internal geometry state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of assert for plane normal check is standard. The code relies on external geometry libraries but does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class for geographic geometries with methods for manipulating geometric shapes, including conversion from geojson formats. It uses external libraries for geometry handling, with no signs of malicious intent. No network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code are present. All data flows appear to be standard geometric transformations. No suspicious or malicious patterns or backdoors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for geographic data manipulation with no malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It primarily performs geometry transformations and conversions, with no indications of malware or malicious intent.",
