  "purpose": "A base class for GeoJSON geometry objects, providing methods for geometric transformations and conversions from geojson coordinates to internal geometry representations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for geometry creation and transformation methods, such as coordinate data, origin points, and transformation vectors.",
  "sinks": "Internal geometry objects; no external data sinks or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through conversion functions into internal geometry objects, then through transformation methods like move, rotate, reflect, and scale.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external system interactions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward geometric utility class relying on external libraries for geometry operations. It performs data validation, geometric transformations, and coordinate conversions without network or file I/O. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The static methods convert geojson coordinates into internal geometry objects safely, and the class methods perform standard transformations. The code structure is clear, with proper validation and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured geometric utility class with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain security issues. It relies on external libraries for geometry operations and performs safe data handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (0.1).",
