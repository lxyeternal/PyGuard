{
  "purpose": "This code extends existing property classes to add energy-related attributes and links model exporting functions to the model_writer module.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dragonfly.properties' and local module properties; class attributes and method calls within the code.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of _energy attributes, method calls to create energy property instances, and addition of functions to model_writer.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class attribute assignments lead to property method calls that instantiate energy properties; finally, functions are assigned to an external module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls. The code uses standard class modifications and function assignments without malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies class properties by setting a private attribute '_energy' to None and defining methods to instantiate energy property objects on demand. It then assigns these methods as properties of the classes. Additionally, it assigns functions to the model_writer module. All operations appear to be standard class extension practices. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors such as network communication, file manipulation, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of property classes with no malicious intent. It adds energy property attributes and links export functions for models. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
