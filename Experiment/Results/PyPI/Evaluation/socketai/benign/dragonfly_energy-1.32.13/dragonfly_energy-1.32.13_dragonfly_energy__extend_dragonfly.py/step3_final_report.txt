  "purpose": "Extend property classes with lazy-initialized energy attributes and assign model export functions to external module.",
  "sources": "Class attribute '_energy', property methods accessing 'self.host', external functions assigned to 'model_writer'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Property methods access 'self.host' to instantiate energy properties; functions assigned to 'model_writer' for exporting models.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'self.host' in property methods is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard class extension patterns, adding lazy-loaded energy properties and linking export functions. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The use of 'self.host' is typical in such frameworks and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report is conservative; overall, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of property classes with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; no modifications needed.",
