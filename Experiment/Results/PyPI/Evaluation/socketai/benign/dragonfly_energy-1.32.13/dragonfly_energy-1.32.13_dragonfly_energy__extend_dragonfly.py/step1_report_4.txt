{
  "purpose": "This code extends property classes with energy calculation methods and assigns model writer functions for exporting data.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dragonfly.properties' and local module properties; class attributes such as '_energy'; method definitions accessing 'self.host'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of 'self._energy' attributes, call to 'self.host' in property methods, and assignment of functions to 'model_writer' module attributes.",
  "flows": "Property methods read 'self.host' and assign to 'self._energy'; 'model_writer' functions are linked to module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code detected. Use of '_energy' as a private attribute is standard. No unusual dynamic code execution or external data transfers observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily modifies class properties to lazily initialize energy-related properties, which is a common pattern. It assigns functions for exporting models. No external data inputs, network calls, or file manipulations are present. The '_energy' attribute is used internally within the class instances, and the property methods rely on 'self.host' but without any apparent malicious use. The added functions for model export are assigned straightforwardly to a module, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension of existing classes to add energy properties and model export functions. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The structure and content are consistent with typical application code.",
