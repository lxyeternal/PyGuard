  "conclusion": "The code is a standard automation framework for energy simulation workflows with no malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate; malware score is low (0.1), obfuscation absent (0), and security risk moderate (~0.4) due to external process calls and embedded secrets. Minor improvements include input validation and avoiding hardcoded secrets, but overall, the code is safe from malicious activity."
