{
  "purpose": "This code imports a function 'energy' from the 'dragonfly_energy.cli' module and executes it when the script runs as the main program. Its purpose appears to be to run some energy-related CLI functionality.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'energy' from the 'dragonfly_energy.cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'energy()' function call is a potential sink; any untrusted input or malicious behavior would depend on the implementation of 'energy()' within that module.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are visible in this code; the flow depends entirely on what 'energy()' does when invoked.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies in this minimal code snippet. It is a straightforward module import and function call.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a function and calls it within a standard Python entry point guard. No suspicious or malicious code is visible in this fragment. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'energy()' in the 'dragonfly_energy.cli' module. Without inspecting that module, there is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The structure and format are typical for CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The security risk and malware likelihood are low, but further review of the 'energy()' implementation is necessary to confirm safety.",
