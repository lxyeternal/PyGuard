  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes the 'energy' function from 'dragonfly_energy.cli'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'energy' from 'dragonfly_energy.cli'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'energy()' which executes external code; potential for malicious behavior depends on 'energy()' implementation.",
  "flows": "Source: import of 'energy' -> Sink: execution of 'energy()' in main guard.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward code with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple script that imports and runs 'energy()'. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'energy()'. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are visible in this snippet. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting uncertainty about 'energy()' but no evidence of malicious intent. The confidence in benignity is high, but the overall risk depends on external code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for CLI entry points. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The security assessment hinges on 'energy()' implementation, which cannot be evaluated here. Scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of anomalies.",
