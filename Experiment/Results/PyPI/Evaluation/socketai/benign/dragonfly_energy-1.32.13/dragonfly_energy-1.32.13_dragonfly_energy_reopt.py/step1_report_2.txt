  "purpose": "Define classes and parameters for configuring REopt simulation settings and photovoltaic ground mount systems.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from JSON files for the REopt parameters and from class attributes for ground-mounted PV system definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks; the code mainly manipulates objects and data structures internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input JSON files into parameter objects; these objects modify dictionaries used for simulation configurations. GroundMountPV objects generate GeoJSON and dict representations for spatial data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No external network activity, no file manipulations beyond reading configurations, and no code injection points are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of class definitions, property setters/getters, and data serialization methods. It performs data validation and conversions but contains no network operations, file writes, or execution of dynamic code. The input data is read only from files specified via filenames, and no user input is directly processed within the code. No suspicious behaviors such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data structures for simulation configuration with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It mainly handles data validation, object copying, and serialization, with no network, file modification, or execution of untrusted code.",
