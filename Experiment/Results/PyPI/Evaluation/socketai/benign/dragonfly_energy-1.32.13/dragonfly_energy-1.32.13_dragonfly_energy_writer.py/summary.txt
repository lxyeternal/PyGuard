  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for preparing urban simulation input files. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) reflects routine file and directory management routines. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, consistent with the code's transparency and purpose."
