  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports a parsing function for UK postcodes, likely intended for processing or validating postcode data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the source code file itself and the imported 'parse_uk_postcode' function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the future feature, then importing a specific function from a local module, with no further data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for compatibility, then imports a single function from a local parser module. There are no input sources or untrusted data flows shown. The simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, functioning as a simple import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
