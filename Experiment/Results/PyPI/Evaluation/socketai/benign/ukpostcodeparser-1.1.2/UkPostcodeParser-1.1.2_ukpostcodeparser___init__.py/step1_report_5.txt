{
  "purpose": "The code imports the absolute_import feature for Python 2/3 compatibility and imports a parse_uk_postcode function from a local parser module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statements and the local parser module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports are present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure with no unusual patterns or suspicious code segments; the import of a parser function itself is not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module import snippet. It uses future import for compatibility and imports a parsing function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network operations, credential handling, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only standard import statements without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
