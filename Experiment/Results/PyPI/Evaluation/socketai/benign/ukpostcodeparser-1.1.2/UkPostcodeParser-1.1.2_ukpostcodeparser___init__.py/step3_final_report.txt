  "purpose": "Import a future feature for compatibility and a local parser function for postcode parsing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ and local module .parser",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import statements do not create data flows or source-to-sink paths",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It imports a future feature and a local function, which are standard practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statements are standard and do not pose any threat. All signals and reports correctly assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero, consistent with the code's nature.",
