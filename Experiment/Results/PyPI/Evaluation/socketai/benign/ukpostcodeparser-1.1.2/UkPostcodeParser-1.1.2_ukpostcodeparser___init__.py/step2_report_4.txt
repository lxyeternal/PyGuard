  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the content.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal set of import statements: importing a future feature and a local function.\n- No data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Benign, straightforward import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues detected.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Also benign, standard import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Minimal import, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n- The **confidence scores** are high, which is reasonable.\n- No changes needed; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet is benign, serving a simple import purpose with no security concerns.",
