{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'parse_uk_postcode' from a local module called 'parser'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.parser'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; only a module import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with no additional logic or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature to ensure compatibility across Python versions and then imports a function from a local module. There are no network connections, data handling, or execution of untrusted input. The minimal nature of the code does not present any malware or security risks. The presence of a local import indicates it's part of a larger codebase, but nothing malicious is apparent from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a harmless module import statement with no malicious intent or security issues.",
