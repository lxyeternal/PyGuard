{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions based on its structure and imports.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables, function parameters, or external modules, but no specific data sources such as files, network, or user input are clearly evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communication, or data output functions, but none are explicitly shown in the code fragment provided.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows identified; the code mostly performs calculations or utility operations without external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are observed. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines functions that perform basic operations. There is no indication of data leakage, insecure data handling, or malicious behavior. No suspicious external network connections or system modifications are present. The lack of complex or hidden logic suggests this is standard utility code. Since no data is being sent externally or system commands executed maliciously, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be standard utility or processing code without harmful intent.",
