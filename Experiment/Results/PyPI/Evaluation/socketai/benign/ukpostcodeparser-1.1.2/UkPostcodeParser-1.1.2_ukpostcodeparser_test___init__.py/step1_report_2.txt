  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing, potentially involving external inputs and outputs.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console, writes to files, or makes network requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec), obfuscated variable names, or unnecessary complexity. Hardcoded credentials or suspicious network domains would also be anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports and environment setup, then includes functions that process data. It contains conditional logic and possibly dynamic execution. No evident hardcoded secrets or network connections are immediately visible. However, if there is dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts, they could indicate malicious intent. The absence of explicit malicious functions or known bad patterns suggests it is benign, but without full visibility into external dependencies or hidden code, there is some uncertainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical data processing script with no clear signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network communications, or backdoors are detected. However, potential dynamic execution or obfuscated code warrants caution. Overall risk is low, but a thorough review of the entire codebase and dependencies is recommended.",
