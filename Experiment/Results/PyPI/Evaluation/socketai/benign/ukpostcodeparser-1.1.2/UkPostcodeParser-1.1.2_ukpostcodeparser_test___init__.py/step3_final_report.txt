{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, or standard library functions, with no external data sources or untrusted inputs evident.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent over the network, written to sensitive files, or executed in an unsafe manner; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows within the module are straightforward, from input parameters through processing functions to return statements, with no untrusted data reaching sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are present. The code structure is clear and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns. The high confidence (0.9) reflects the straightforward nature of the code. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The low security risk score (0.1) aligns with the benign assessment, and the malware score (0) is justified by the absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
