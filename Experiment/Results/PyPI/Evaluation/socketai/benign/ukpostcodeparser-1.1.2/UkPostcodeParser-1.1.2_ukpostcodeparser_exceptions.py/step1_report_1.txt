  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to postcode validation errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this code only defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply defines exception classes with inheritance",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes for specific postcode errors. These classes inherit from built-in exception classes and contain no executable logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs. There are no sources or sinks, and the code appears to be purely declarative. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code's structure is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class declaration for postcode-related errors with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
