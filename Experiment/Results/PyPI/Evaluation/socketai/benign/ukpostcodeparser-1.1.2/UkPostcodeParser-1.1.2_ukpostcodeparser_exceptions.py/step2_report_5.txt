  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from `ValueError`.\n   - There are no sources, sinks, or data flows, confirming that the code is purely declarative.\n   - No evidence of executable logic, data handling, or malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a risk of 0, there's no need to justify higher scores.\n   - The code is harmless, so a high risk score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious behavior is present; the code only defines exception classes.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of class definitions for postcode validation errors. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is standard practice for error handling in Python.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
