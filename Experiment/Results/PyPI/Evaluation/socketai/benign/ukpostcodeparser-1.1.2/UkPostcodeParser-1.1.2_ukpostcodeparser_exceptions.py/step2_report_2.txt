  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the correctness of their conclusions and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - Confirms the code is benign, no anomalies, no malicious intent.\n   - Scores: malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n   - **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - Similar to Report 1, confirms no suspicious patterns.\n   - Scores: malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n   - **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - Same conclusion, standard class definitions.\n   - Scores: malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n   - **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - Same reasoning, straightforward exception classes.\n   - Scores: malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n   - **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Consistent with others, no issues detected.\n   - Scores: malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 1.\n   - **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscation concerns.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a straightforward, benign declaration of custom exception classes with no security concerns.",
