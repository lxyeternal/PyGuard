  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for postcode validation errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink identified",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no data input, output, or processing operations. No external library usage, no code execution, no network activity. The class hierarchy appears standard for exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of custom exceptions related to postcode errors. It contains no malicious intent, no security risks, and is structurally simple and benign.",
