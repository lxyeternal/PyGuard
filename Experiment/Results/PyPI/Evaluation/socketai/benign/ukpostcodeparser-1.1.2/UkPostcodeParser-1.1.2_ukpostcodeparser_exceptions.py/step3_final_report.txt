  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes for postcode validation errors",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, no data input or external interactions",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows",
  "flows": "None; purely declarative class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class inheritance without suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from ValueError, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of security-sensitive operations. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent, and the scores accurately reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward declaration of custom exception classes with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
