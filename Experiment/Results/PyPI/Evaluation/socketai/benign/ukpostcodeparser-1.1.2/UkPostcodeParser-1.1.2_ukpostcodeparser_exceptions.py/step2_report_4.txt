  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports agree that the code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, with no data input, output, or processing. There are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs. This is consistent across all reports.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning.**  \nThe reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of security risks. They correctly identify that the code is purely declarative and does not involve any suspicious activity. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- Confidence: All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.  \n- Malware: All reports assign 0, which is correct—no malicious behavior is detected or suggested.  \n- SecurityRisk: All reports assign 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any higher risk scores.**  \nSince all reports and analyses indicate no malicious intent, no security risks, and no obfuscation, there is no justification for raising the risk score above 0.5. The code is clearly safe.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores.**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities.**  \nThe reports correctly assume that the code is just class definitions. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary, as there are none.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency between scores and report content.**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis—no discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign declaration of custom exception classes with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is harmless, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive review and the consistent findings across all reports.",
