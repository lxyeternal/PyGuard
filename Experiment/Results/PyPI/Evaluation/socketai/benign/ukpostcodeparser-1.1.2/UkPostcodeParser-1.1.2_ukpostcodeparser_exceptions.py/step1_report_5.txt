  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for postcode validation errors",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading in this code segment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance for exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in ValueError. These classes are likely used elsewhere in the project for handling postcode validation errors such as invalid postcodes, length violations, and missing incode segments. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no data leaks, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no external communication or file operations. The code appears to be a standard and clean implementation of custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception class definitions used for error handling related to postcode validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation in this fragment.",
