  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this and note the benign nature.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning. They correctly state that there are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, which is justified given the code's simplicity and lack of security-sensitive operations.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any potential security risk that would warrant a higher score. The code is purely declarative, defining exception classes, which inherently pose no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain any malicious constructs. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content and structure.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and clarity of this code snippet, I would agree with the reports' assessments. There is no reason to assign any higher scores or suspect malicious intent.\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, benign class declaration for custom exceptions with no security concerns.**",
