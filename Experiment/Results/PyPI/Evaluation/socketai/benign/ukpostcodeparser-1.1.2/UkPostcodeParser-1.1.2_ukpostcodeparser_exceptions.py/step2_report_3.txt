  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `ValueError`. There are no data flows, input/output operations, or executable logic. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly state that the code is purely declarative, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. No flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions with no executable or external interactions, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The same applies to malware and obfuscation scores.\n\n5. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly state that there are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard, benign set of class definitions for custom exceptions related to postcode validation. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nI agree with the assessments provided in the reports. The code is safe, straightforward, and carries no security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
