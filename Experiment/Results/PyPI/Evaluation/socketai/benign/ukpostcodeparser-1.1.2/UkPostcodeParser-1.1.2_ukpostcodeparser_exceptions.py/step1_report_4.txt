  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes related to postcode validation errors",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output points present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of inheritance for custom exceptions is standard; no unusual code patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code only declares custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception classes. There are no data input, data processing, or output operations. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious behavior. The structure is typical for custom exception definitions in Python. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes for validation errors related to postcodes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and standard.",
