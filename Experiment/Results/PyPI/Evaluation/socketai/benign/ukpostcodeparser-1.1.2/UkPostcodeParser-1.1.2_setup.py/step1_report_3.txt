  "purpose": "Setup script for the UkPostcodeParser Python package, used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs; static metadata such as package name, version, author info, and package list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no runtime data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static package configuration without dynamic execution or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, no external data sources, nor any suspicious behaviors. The package metadata appears typical for a Python package. The only files included are package directories and test directory, with no code execution or data handling beyond static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a typical package configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs standard setup operations for publishing a Python package.",
