  "purpose": "Define package metadata for UkPostcodeParser using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters: name, version, author, author_email, packages, url, description, license.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed metadata. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network calls, or external data handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, harmless nature.",
