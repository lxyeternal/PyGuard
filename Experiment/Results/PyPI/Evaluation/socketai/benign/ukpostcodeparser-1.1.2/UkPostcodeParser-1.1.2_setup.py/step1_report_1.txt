  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the UkPostcodeParser Python package, defining package metadata and structure.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, no output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of setuptools.setup() with static metadata. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package information such as name, version, author, email, packages, URL, description, and license. All data are static strings, with no user input, external data, or dynamic code execution. No indicators of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no malicious code or security risks detected. It contains static metadata only and does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
