  "purpose": "UK postcode parser that normalizes, validates, and splits postcodes into outcode and incode components.",
  "sources": "Input string 'postcode' after whitespace removal and uppercase normalization.",
  "sinks": "Regex matching groups for postcode components; exception raising for invalid formats.",
  "flows": "Input -> normalization -> regex validation -> match groups -> return outcode and incode or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external system access; reliance on regex patterns and external exceptions module.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard UK postcode validation using regex patterns based on postcode standards. It normalizes input, checks length, and matches against regex for full or partial postcodes. Special cases like 'GIR0AA' are handled explicitly. Exception handling is delegated to an external module, but no malicious behavior is evident. No external network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. The regex patterns are complex but standard for postcode validation. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with a benign validation utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign UK postcode parser with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
