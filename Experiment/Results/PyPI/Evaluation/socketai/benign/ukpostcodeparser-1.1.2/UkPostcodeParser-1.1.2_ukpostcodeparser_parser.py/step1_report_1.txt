  "purpose": "UK postcode parser to validate and split postcodes into outcode and incode components.",
  "sources": "Reads input 'postcode' parameter, uses regex patterns for validation.",
  "sinks": "Returns tuples of postcode parts, raises exceptions on invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input postcode -> normalization -> regex matching for validation -> return parts or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Use of regex patterns appears standard for postcode validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs postcode validation through regex matching and simple string operations. It imports exceptions for error handling, which are likely standard or well-defined. No dynamic execution, no network activity, or system modifications are present. The regex patterns seem correctly constructed for postcode validation; no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The code does not read sensitive environment variables, nor does it perform any data leakage or external communications. The only potentially suspicious aspect is the use of exceptions for control flow, but these are likely standard exception classes. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward postcode parser with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard UK postcode parser with validation logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. It appears safe and benign.",
