{
  "purpose": "UK postcode parser that validates and splits UK postcodes into outcode and incode components.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'postcode' parameter in the 'parse_uk_postcode' function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access; the code only processes and returns data.",
  "flows": "Input postcode -> normalization and validation -> regex matching -> return outcode and incode.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom exceptions from 'ukpostcodeparser.exceptions' suggests reliance on external error handling, but no suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs pattern-based validation of UK postcodes using regex and predefined postcode components. It normalizes input, matches against complex regex patterns, and raises specific exceptions for invalid input or when incode is missing if mandatory. There are no network operations, file access, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident. The code's sole purpose appears to be postcode validation and parsing, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain tampering.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward UK postcode parser that performs validation, normalization, and splitting of postcodes. It does not contain malicious behaviors or security risks. It relies on standard regex validation and exception handling. No indicators of malware or malicious supply chain behavior are present.",
