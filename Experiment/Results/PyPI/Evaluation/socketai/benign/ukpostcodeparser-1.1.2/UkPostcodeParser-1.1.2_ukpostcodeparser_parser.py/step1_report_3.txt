{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse UK postcodes into their components (outcode and incode).",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'postcode' parameter passed to 'parse_uk_postcode' function.",
  "sinks": "Returns parsed postcode components; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input postcode -> normalization -> regex matching -> return outcode and incode components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls; code appears standard for postcode parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines extensive regex patterns for UK postcode validation, then uses them to parse input postcodes. It normalizes input, validates length, and performs regex matching to split into outcode and incode. The 'strict' mode enforces postcode validation rules, while non-strict mode simply slices the string. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic is present. No external network calls, data leaks, or malware behavior observed. The exceptions module is imported but not shown; assuming standard exception handling. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate UK postcode parser with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and parsing as expected, with no suspicious or malicious operations.",
