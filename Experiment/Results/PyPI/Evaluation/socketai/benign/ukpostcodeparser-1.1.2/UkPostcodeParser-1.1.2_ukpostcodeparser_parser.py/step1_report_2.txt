  "purpose": "UK postcode parser for splitting and validating UK postcodes into outcode and incode components.",
  "sources": "Reads input postcode string provided as a function argument.",
  "sinks": "Returns tuple of outcode and incode; raises exceptions on invalid input; no external sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input postcode is normalized, validated against regex patterns, and then split into outcode and incode or errors raised if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Regex patterns are complex but standard for postcode validation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Special case for 'GIR0AA' handled explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward UK postcode parser that normalizes input, validates format via regex, and splits the postcode. It uses regular expressions built from known postcode components for validation. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The only notable aspect is the use of regex for validation, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Exception handling is for validation errors, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate UK postcode parser without malicious intent. It performs input validation, parsing, and error handling solely related to postcode formatting. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
