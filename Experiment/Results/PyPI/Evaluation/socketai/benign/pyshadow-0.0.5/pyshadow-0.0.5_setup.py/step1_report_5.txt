{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pyshadow' Python package, which is a Selenium plugin for managing shadow DOM elements on web pages.",
  "sources": "Reads the package description from 'README.md', reads package data from resources directories, and gathers package dependencies specified in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted. No sensitive data handling is detected.",
  "flows": "The code flows from source inputs (package metadata and dependencies) to package setup and installation configuration; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed in a dangerous manner.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. The 'long_description' reading from 'README.md' is a common pattern and appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README file for long description, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and includes package data. No code execution, data manipulation, or network operations occur. No anomalies or suspicious code structures are identified. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for package distribution.",
