  "purpose": "Package configuration for the pyshadow library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, dependencies list, package data definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static data from package metadata to setup configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without error handling when reading README.md, but this is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools for packaging. It statically defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data. The only dynamic operation is reading README.md, which is common and safe. No user input, network activity, or code execution occurs. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The open() call could raise an error if README.md is missing, but this does not impact security. All signals indicate benign, straightforward package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code. Minor note: error handling for file reading could be added but is not a security concern.",
