  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pyshadow' Python package, primarily to facilitate packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package description from 'README.md', package dependencies from 'install_requires', and package data from specified resource paths.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data or external inputs directly.",
  "flows": "Reads description and package data from filesystem, dependencies from PyPI, and metadata for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code is standard setup script using setuptools.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, then calls setup() with static metadata fields such as name, description, version, author info, dependencies, and package data. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, and no network communications present. All components follow standard packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The script solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
