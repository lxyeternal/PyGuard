{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging of the 'pyshadow' Python library, primarily for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the long_description from 'README.md', gathering package data, and collecting dependency requirements.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits data to external sources; no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (README.md) and package metadata into the setup configuration; no untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard package setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setuptools modules and invokes the setup() function with typical package metadata, dependencies, and package data. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. All inputs are static strings or file reads, with no user input or external data processing. The open('README.md').read() call is safe as it simply reads a local file, assuming the file exists. There are no backdoors, hidden behaviors, or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It follows typical packaging conventions without any suspicious behaviors.",
