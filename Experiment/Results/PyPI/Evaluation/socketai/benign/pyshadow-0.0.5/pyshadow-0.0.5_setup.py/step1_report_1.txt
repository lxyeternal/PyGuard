{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'pyshadow' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the long description from 'README.md' file; static string definitions for package info; dependency list in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' without error handling; no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, then calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and package data. The only dynamic operation is reading a README file, which is standard for package setup. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling present. No suspicious or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or insecure practices.",
