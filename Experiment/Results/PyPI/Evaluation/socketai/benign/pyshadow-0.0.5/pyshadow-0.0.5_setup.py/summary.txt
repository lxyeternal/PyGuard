  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code. Minor note: error handling for file reading could be added but is not a security concern."
