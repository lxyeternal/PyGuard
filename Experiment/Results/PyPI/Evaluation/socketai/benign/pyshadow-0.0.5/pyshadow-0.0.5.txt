The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code. Minor note: error handling for file reading could be added but is not a security concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Selenium utility with potential injection vulnerabilities due to dynamic script execution with unvalidated inputs. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is input sanitization to prevent injection attacks. The scores assigned in the reports are mostly appropriate; I recommend setting the malware score to 0, obfuscated to 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.4) to reflect the injection surface without active malicious activity."
