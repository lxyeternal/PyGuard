  "purpose": "This source code appears to be designed for a typical Python script or module, potentially for performing specific data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input, configuration files, or environment variables; possibly includes external library imports that may access network or file systems.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or console output; uses functions that could execute system commands or write to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly passing untrusted data to sinks such as system commands or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. No evident malicious or privacy-invading behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code was carefully reviewed for malicious behavior. It employs standard library functions and typical coding patterns. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or sabotage were identified. The code structure and format are consistent with legitimate Python scripts. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows were found. The overall logic and functions appear benign and aligned with normal usage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign Python script without any malicious behaviors or security issues.",
