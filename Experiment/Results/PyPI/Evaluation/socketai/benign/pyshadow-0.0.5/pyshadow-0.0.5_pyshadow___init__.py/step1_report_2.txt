  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or system interaction, but without explicit comments or documentation, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, input functions, or external files (if any are present), but no specific sources are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or system commands if present, but none are clearly observable in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows; the code's logic appears straightforward, with no suspicious data manipulation or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code lacks obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no signs of malicious behavior. It does not include network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries is typical, and no suspicious patterns or backdoors are present. The overall structure and content do not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard in behavior, with no indications of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
