  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, file operations, dynamic imports, logging, standard data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into processing functions, possibly reaching sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic imports and verbose logging noted but justified; no suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code descriptions across reports indicate straightforward, benign behavior with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are consistent with the absence of suspicious patterns. Low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the lack of code snippets but trusting the summaries. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the dependency poses minimal security risk.",
