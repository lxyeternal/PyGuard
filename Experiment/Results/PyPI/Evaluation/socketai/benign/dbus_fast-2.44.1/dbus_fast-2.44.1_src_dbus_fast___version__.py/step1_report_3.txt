  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'dbus_fast' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author, email, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for metadata variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A - static metadata assignment, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments containing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright. No external input processing, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling or network operations are present. This is typical for Python package setup or module info and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
