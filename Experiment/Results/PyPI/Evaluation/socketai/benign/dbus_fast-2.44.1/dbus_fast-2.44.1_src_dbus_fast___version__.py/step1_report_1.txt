  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'dbus_fast' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author, contact info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments at the top of the module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns static metadata values",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module-level string assignments setting package metadata. There are no input handling, data processing, or external interactions that could pose security risks. The code appears to be straightforward, clean, and typical of Python package metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely metadata with no malicious or suspicious content. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
