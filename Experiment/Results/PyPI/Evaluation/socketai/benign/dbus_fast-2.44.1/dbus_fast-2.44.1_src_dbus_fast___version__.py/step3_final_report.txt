  "sources": "Static string assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__)",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, external interactions, or dynamic code execution present",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static metadata without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata, with no input handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence (1). The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign nature. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is present. The scores are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe package metadata file with no security concerns or malicious activity. All reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
