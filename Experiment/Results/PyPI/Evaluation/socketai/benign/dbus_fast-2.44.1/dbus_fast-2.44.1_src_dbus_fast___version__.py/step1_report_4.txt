  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'dbus_fast' Python library.",
  "sources": "Module-level variables assigning metadata values (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely sets static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; standard metadata declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward assignments of package metadata variables. No input, data reading, or dynamic execution present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The metadata aligns with common Python package conventions, and no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate and benign part of the package setup.",
