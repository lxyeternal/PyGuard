  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a DBusError class for error handling in a messaging system, specifically for D-Bus communication.",
  "sources": "Import statements for constants, message, and validators modules; Exception class initializers; Methods in DBusError class.",
  "sinks": "Method calls such as assert_interface_name_valid and type checks on reply; Construction of Message objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (error types, message objects) are processed through exception initializers and static methods, with validation functions invoked to ensure data correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Exception classes follow standard patterns. The DBusError class performs validation and constructs error messages safely.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes for various error types used in a messaging context. The DBusError class validates input parameters, ensuring they are of expected types and formats, particularly validating message types and interface names. The methods involve safe construction of error messages, leveraging existing message classes and validation functions. There is no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The use of assertions and type checks is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. No external data is read or written in a manner that could lead to leaks or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of standard exception class definitions and a well-structured error handling class for D-Bus communication. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are apparent. The code appears to serve its intended purpose securely.",
