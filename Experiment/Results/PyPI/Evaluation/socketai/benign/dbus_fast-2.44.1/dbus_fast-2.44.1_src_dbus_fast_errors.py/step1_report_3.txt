  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a DBusError class for error handling within a D-Bus communication library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructors, method parameters, and assertion functions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written to external systems, files, or network within this code segment.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; data used is either input parameters or internal class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is used.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines error classes and a specialized error handling class, with validation and type assertions. It imports constants and message classes and performs type checks and assertions. No external data handling, no system calls, and no malicious behaviors are evident. All code appears standard for error management in a D-Bus context.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as standard error class definitions for a D-Bus library, with proper type validation and message handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this fragment.",
