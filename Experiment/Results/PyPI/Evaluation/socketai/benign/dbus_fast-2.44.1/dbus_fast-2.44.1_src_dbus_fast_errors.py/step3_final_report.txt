  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and a DBusError class for error handling and validation within a Python D-Bus messaging library.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, assertions, type checks, imports from constants, message, and validators modules.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of DBusError, validation functions, message creation via Message.new_error.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation and into error message creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions for error handling, with validation via assertions and type checks. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The validation ensures data integrity, and the code relies on external modules for message handling and validation, which appear standard. No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes and error handling logic for a D-Bus Python library. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
