{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a messaging system, particularly for DBus error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .constants, .message, and .validators modules; usage of class constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "Usage of assert_interface_name_valid() and type checks; creation of Message objects via Message.new_error().",
  "flows": "Validation functions are called before creating or transforming Message objects, ensuring type and value integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic execution. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes and a DBusError class with methods for constructing and representing error messages. It performs input validation using assert_interface_name_valid() and type checks to ensure proper usage. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. All code appears to be standard for error handling and message management within a messaging protocol. The use of assertions and type validations enhances robustness but does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard part of a messaging system's error handling module. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation appears safe, clean, and purpose-specific.",
