  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes and error handling logic for a D-Bus Python library. It shows no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
