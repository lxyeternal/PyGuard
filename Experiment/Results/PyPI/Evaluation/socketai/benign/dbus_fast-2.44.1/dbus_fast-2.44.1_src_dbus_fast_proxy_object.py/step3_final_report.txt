{
  "purpose": "The code manages proxy interfaces and objects for message bus communication, handling introspection, signals, and message processing.",
  "sources": "Reads include introspection data, message bodies, and signal signatures.",
  "sinks": "Signal handlers and message callbacks, potentially affecting application state or triggering user-defined functions.",
  "flows": "Signals received from bus → message handler → user callback functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard proxy and object management patterns for message bus systems, with dynamic method and signal handling. It performs validation, manages signal subscriptions, and processes messages in an event-driven manner. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The use of introspection data and dynamic attribute creation is typical for such frameworks and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and logic are consistent with benign, well-established patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, secure implementation of a message bus proxy system. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The risk score is low, primarily due to reliance on external introspection data, which is a known aspect of such systems but not inherently malicious.",
