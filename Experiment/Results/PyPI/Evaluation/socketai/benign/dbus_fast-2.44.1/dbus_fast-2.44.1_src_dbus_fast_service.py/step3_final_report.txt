  "purpose": "Framework for defining DBus interfaces with decorators for methods, signals, and properties, enabling communication over the bus with introspection and callback handling.",
  "sources": "Annotations, class members, message bodies, decorator arguments, dynamic attributes for methods/signals/properties.",
  "sinks": "Method invocation, property get/set, signal emission, callback execution, message handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from message bodies and annotations into method calls, property accessors, and signal broadcasts; decorators register metadata; callbacks process results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute setting (__DBUS_METHOD, etc.) is typical for decorators; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "Standard reflection, annotation parsing, async handling, and callback mechanisms are employed. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code structure aligns with common patterns for such frameworks. Deep copying message bodies is noted but not malicious. The use of dynamic attributes is typical for decorator metadata storage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a DBus service interface framework. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The low risk score of 0.2 reflects the inherent trust in such frameworks but does not indicate any actual vulnerabilities.",
