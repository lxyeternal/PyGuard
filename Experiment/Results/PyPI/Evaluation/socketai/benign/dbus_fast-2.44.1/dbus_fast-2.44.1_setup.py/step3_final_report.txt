  "purpose": "Package setup script for 'dbus-fast', defining metadata, build instructions, and package data.",
  "sources": "No external untrusted input; static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'build' and 'setup' functions; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Execution of build(setup_kwargs) before setup(), no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Import from 'build_ext' and invocation of 'build(setup_kwargs)' are unusual but not malicious; typical in custom build environments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with some non-standard build extension usage. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, network activity, or data exfiltration. The 'build_ext' import and 'build()' call are consistent with custom build steps, not malicious behavior. No external inputs or secrets are present. The high confidence scores across reports reflect the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. The unusual build extension usage is a common pattern in customized build processes and does not indicate malicious activity.",
