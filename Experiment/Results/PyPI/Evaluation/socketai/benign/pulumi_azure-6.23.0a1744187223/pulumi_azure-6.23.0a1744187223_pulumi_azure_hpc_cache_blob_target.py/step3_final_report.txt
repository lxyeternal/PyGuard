  "purpose": "Auto-generated Pulumi resource definitions for managing HPC Cache Blob Targets in Azure, including input types, resource classes, and property accessors.",
  "sources": "Resource argument classes, property getters/setters, import functions, and resource registration code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no external network calls, no file manipulations, no command executions.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into resource properties; resource IDs are used for referencing storage containers; no external data flows or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is standard, auto-generated boilerplate with explicit warnings against manual editing; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated Pulumi resource class for Azure HPC Cache Blob Targets. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The resource properties and import mechanisms are standard for infrastructure as code. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or secrets are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscation: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's nature. The resource IDs and import paths are typical in IaC scripts and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's purpose is purely declarative resource management, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi resource definitions for managing HPC Cache Blob Targets. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The resource IDs and import paths are standard, and the overall security risk is very low. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. This dependency is safe and suitable for use in infrastructure management.",
