{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource types and arguments for managing HPC Cache Blob Targets within Azure, including input classes, state classes, and the resource class itself.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from constructor parameters, class properties, and Pulumi input functions. It does not process external untrusted input streams or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks, command execution, or system modifications outside the Pulumi resource management context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor arguments into internal state, then through Pulumi's get/set functions to manage resource properties; no external untrusted data is used for system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is primarily boilerplate for resource management with standard structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource definition with input/output property management, resource initialization, and get methods. It includes documentation, example usage, and resource registration logic. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or external data processing that could be exploited. The code appears to be auto-generated, with safeguards against obfuscation or malicious modifications. No sensitive data handling, network calls, or command execution is visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource class implementation for managing Azure HPC Cache Blob Targets. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for infrastructure as code management. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is detected.",
