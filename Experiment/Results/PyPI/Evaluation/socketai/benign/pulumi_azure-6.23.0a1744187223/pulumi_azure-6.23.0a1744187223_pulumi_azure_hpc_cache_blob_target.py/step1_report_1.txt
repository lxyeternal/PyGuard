{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi resource types and arguments for managing HPC Cache Blob Targets, including resource classes, input types, and property accessors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for resource creation, including resource names, IDs, paths, and optional properties; data source fetches (e.g., resource_manager_id).",
  "sinks": "Resource creation and property getters; no data flows into untrusted sinks such as network calls or file writes; resource import functions are present but standard.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are assigned to resource properties, which are used during resource initialization; no suspicious data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Generated by Pulumi's code generation tool; includes extensive comments warning against manual editing; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs; no obfuscated code or unusual logic patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily auto-generated boilerplate for defining resource classes and input/output property accessors using Pulumi SDK conventions. It manages resource arguments and state with no embedded malicious behavior. No network, file, or system manipulation code is present. The only potential concern is the reliance on resource IDs and import paths, but these are standard in infrastructure as code workflows and do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate auto-generated resource management library with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Pulumi resource definition for managing HPC Cache Blob Targets. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is generated by a tool and adheres to typical infrastructure as code patterns. No malware or suspicious anomalies are identified.",
