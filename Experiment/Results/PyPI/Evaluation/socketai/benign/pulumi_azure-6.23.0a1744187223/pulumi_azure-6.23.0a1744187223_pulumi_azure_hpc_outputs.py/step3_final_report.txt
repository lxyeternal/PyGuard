{
  "purpose": "The code models configuration data structures for HPC Cache resources, generated by Pulumi's tfgen tool. It defines classes that encapsulate resource properties, primarily for infrastructure as code, with data read from constructor parameters and internal state.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters and internal property getters, which access stored configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No network, file, or code execution; data flows are confined within object properties and internal storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs into internal state, then accessed via property getters; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. Warnings about deprecated or misspelled keys are benign and intended for API stability.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated boilerplate for resource configuration, with straightforward data modeling. It handles sensitive data like passwords and credentials, but only stores and retrieves them without active transmission or malicious use. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is observed. Warnings for key mismatches are benign. The code's structure and purpose are purely configuration-focused, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, legitimate infrastructure configuration code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Handling of sensitive data is explicit but standard for configuration code. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and minimal security risk (~0.2) are justified based on the analysis.",
