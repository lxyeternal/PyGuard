  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes resource classes for HPC Cache Access Policies.\n- Sources: Constructor parameters, property getters, get method.\n- Sinks: No harmful data sinks.\n- Flows: Input data flows into resource properties; get retrieves state.\n- Anomalies: No malicious logic, code injection, or obfuscation. Warns about code generation, which is typical.\n- Analysis: Standard Pulumi resource pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate code, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1: Defines classes and resources, standard patterns, no suspicious logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate Pulumi code, very low security risk.\n- Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on resource class and input argument classes.\n- No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Auto-generated, standard, safe Pulumi resource code.\n- Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern: resource classes, input handling, no malicious activity.\n- No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, auto-generated SDK code.\n- Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, standard resource and argument class definitions.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Proper Pulumi resource code, safe.\n- Confidence: 0.95, Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present; code is clear and standard.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently zero, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n### Final Justification:\nAll reports indicate the code is auto-generated Pulumi resource definitions for managing Azure HPC Cache Access Policies. They follow standard patterns, contain no obfuscated or suspicious logic, and do not process or transmit untrusted data in a harmful way. The high confidence scores and zero malware scores reinforce this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear, standard SDK pattern)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mostly due to the code being auto-generated and potentially misused if misconfigured, but no inherent vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate infrastructure as code, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
