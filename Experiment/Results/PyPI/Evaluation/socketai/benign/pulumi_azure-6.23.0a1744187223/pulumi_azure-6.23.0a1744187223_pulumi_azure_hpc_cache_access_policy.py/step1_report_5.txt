{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes and argument types for managing HPC Cache Access Policies, including creating, retrieving, and filtering such resources.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for resource creation and retrieval (access_rules, hpc_cache_id, name). Property getters and setters that access Pulumi's internal state. No external data sources or untrusted input streams identified.",
  "sinks": "Pulumi's internal get/set functions that manage resource properties. No direct sinks for untrusted data or actions that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource initialization (__internal_init__), which sets resource properties. Getter methods retrieve property values. No external or untrusted data flow identified outside Pulumi's resource management flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard Pulumi resource definition with comprehensive documentation and typical usage patterns. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines argument and state classes for a Pulumi resource, with clear property management and resource initialization routines. It includes standard resource import/export capabilities, well-structured class methods, and proper type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The initial comment warns about auto-generation but does not indicate malicious intent. All operations are consistent with typical infrastructure as code practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi resource module for managing HPC Cache Access Policies. It follows standard patterns for resource definition, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident. The code is well-structured, and no indicators of malware, malicious data flow, or security risks are present.",
