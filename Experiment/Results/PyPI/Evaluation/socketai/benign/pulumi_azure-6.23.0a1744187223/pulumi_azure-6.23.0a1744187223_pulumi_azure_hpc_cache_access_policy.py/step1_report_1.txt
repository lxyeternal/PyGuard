{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi classes and data structures for managing HPC Cache Access Policies, including resource argument classes, input state classes, and the main resource class with methods for creation and retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructors (__init__ methods), property getters (access_rules, hpc_cache_id, name), and the get method for fetching existing resources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data directly. No sinks are present that process untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from user input through constructors and property setters into resource property definitions. The get method uses provided IDs to retrieve resource state.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard boilerplate for Pulumi resource definitions with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns are evident. No network or system interactions are visible in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi resource class implementation with argument classes, input state classes, and resource methods for create and get. It includes type annotations, property accessors, and resource initialization logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The comments and structure are consistent with standard resource definitions. It is purely declarative and does not perform any suspicious operations. The initial comments warn about code generation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pulumi resource definition with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for managing HPC Cache Access Policies. No malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is apparent.",
