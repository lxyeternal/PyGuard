{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes and argument types for managing HPC Cache Access Policies in Azure, enabling infrastructure as code deployments.",
  "sources": "Inputs from parameters such as access_rules, hpc_cache_id, and name; data read from method calls like pulumi.get; resource properties and optional args.",
  "sinks": "Pulumi resource creation and property setting functions; resource state retrieval functions; no explicit data output or network transmission points are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are set during resource initialization, and resource properties are retrieved via getter methods; no flows indicating data leak or malicious activity are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated with standard patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. Usage of standard Pulumi SDK functions and typical resource management patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for input types and a resource class for managing HPC Cache Access Policies in Azure. It employs Pulumi SDK conventions, including property getters/setters, resource initialization, and import capabilities. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden network calls, or data exfiltration logic. The comments, example usage, and resource management logic follow normal patterns. The use of resource options, state retrieval, and input validation is consistent with standard Pulumi practices. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi infrastructure code for Azure HPC Cache Access Policies. It manages resources using standard SDK methods without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. The risk of malware or security vulnerabilities within this module is very low.",
