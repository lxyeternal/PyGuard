{
  "purpose": "Defines Pulumi resource classes and argument/state classes for managing Azure HPC Cache Access Policies, enabling infrastructure as code deployment.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, property getters/setters, resource retrieval methods, and internal Pulumi SDK functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks are present; the code only manages resource definitions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into resource properties; get methods retrieve resource state; no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; the code is standard auto-generated SDK boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Pulumi SDK resource class with associated argument and state classes, following standard patterns. It contains no obfuscated logic, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity. The purpose is to declaratively manage cloud resources. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and comments confirm it is auto-generated SDK code, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free from malicious activity or obfuscation. It represents standard infrastructure as code resource definitions for Azure HPC Cache Access Policies. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the nature of SDK code, which does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
