{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource types and input argument classes for managing HPC Cache Access Policies in Azure, including resource creation, retrieval, and property handling.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters during resource initialization (__init__ methods) and property getters, especially for 'access_rules', 'hpc_cache_id', and 'name'. No external or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external locations, execute external commands, or perform network communication. It primarily manages resource state within Pulumi's infrastructure provisioning framework.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (source) flow into resource properties during initialization; property getters access stored resource state; no external data flows or malicious data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a generated code warning comment indicating it was auto-generated, but there is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious logic, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Pulumi resource and input classes for Azure HPC Cache policies, with typical patterns for defining, initializing, and retrieving resource properties. It uses type hints, property decorators, and resource options correctly. There are no signs of malicious code, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network communication. The presence of a warning comment about code generation is typical for auto-generated SDK code and does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, auto-generated SDK for managing Azure HPC Cache Access Policies via Pulumi. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It solely manages infrastructure resources within the expected framework.",
