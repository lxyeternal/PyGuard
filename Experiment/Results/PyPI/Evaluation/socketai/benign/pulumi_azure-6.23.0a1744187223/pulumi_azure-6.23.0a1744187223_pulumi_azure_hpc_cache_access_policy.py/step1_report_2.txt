{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and resources for managing HPC Cache Access Policies using Pulumi infrastructure as code framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, pulumi modules, and local modules. Reads input parameters during resource initialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses pulumi.set and pulumi.get to handle resource properties. No direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource property setters, which are then used by Pulumi to create/update cloud resources.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a warning comment about code generation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code features. Usage of standard Pulumi resource patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up resource classes and constructors for managing Azure HPC Cache Access Policies via Pulumi. It uses standard Python and Pulumi patterns, including type annotations, resource options, and property getters/setters. No evidence of malicious logic, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The warning at the top indicates automated code generation but does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are present. The structure and content align with typical Pulumi resource definitions for infrastructure management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Pulumi resource class definition for managing HPC Cache Access Policies. It contains no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The warning comment reflects code generation, not malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and typical for its purpose.",
