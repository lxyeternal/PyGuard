  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently identify the code as an autogenerated module for Pulumi Terraform Bridge.\n- The code primarily consists of import statements and module exports.\n- No data processing, input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The comments explicitly state the code is auto-generated, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- The malware scores are all zero, and the security risks are minimal (mostly 0.1 or 0).\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating the reviewers agree on benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors?** No. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no malicious logic.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?** None apparent. The code does not handle untrusted data, execute commands, or perform risky operations.\n- **Obfuscation or secrets?** No. The code is clean and transparent.\n- **Malware or suspicious activity?** No evidence supports this.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws are evident.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, consistent with the clean, autogenerated nature.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code is purely import/export boilerplate with no runtime or dynamic behavior, high malware or obfuscation scores are unjustified.\n- The slight security risk score (0.1) in some reports might reflect the fact that autogenerated code, if compromised at the source, could pose risks, but as-is, the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Overall obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Overall risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, given the benign nature, but the small risk could be justified as a conservative measure for autogenerated code)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, autogenerated module for Pulumi, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nI would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0 if a more conservative stance is preferred)\n\nThis reflects the code's benign, boilerplate nature and the lack of any suspicious or malicious activity.",
