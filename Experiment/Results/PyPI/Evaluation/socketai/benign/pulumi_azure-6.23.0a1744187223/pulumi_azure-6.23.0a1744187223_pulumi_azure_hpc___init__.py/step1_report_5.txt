  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated module setup for Pulumi Terraform Bridge, exporting various submodules related to cache and target configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning, including built-in modules and local submodules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Generated code warning; no malicious code or obfuscation detected; standard import/export structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script, mainly importing and exporting submodules. The comments explicitly state it is auto-generated by a known tool (Pulumi Terraform Bridge), and the structure is typical for package setup. No input reading, no data processing, and no suspicious patterns or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface for a larger Pulumi infrastructure codebase. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
