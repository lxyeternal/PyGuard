  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence for malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, as well as the validity of their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for Pulumi, handling versioning, environment variables, dynamic imports, resource registration, and decorators. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious activity. Dynamic import functions could pose risks if misused externally, but in this context, they are controlled.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing resource registration, version management, environment variables, and dynamic imports. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The potential risk from dynamic imports is acknowledged but considered controlled.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on resource and module registration, version handling, environment variables, and dynamic imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed flow analysis supports the benign interpretation. Dynamic imports are standard in plugin systems and are not malicious here.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — consistent and reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, highlighting utility functions for Pulumi, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The potential misuse of dynamic imports is acknowledged but deemed unlikely in this context.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for Pulumi SDK, versioning, environment variables, dynamic imports, with no malicious intent or malware.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the controlled use of dynamic imports and absence of malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no network activity, no system modifications, no embedded payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, and the code is straightforward, generated boilerplate, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in all cases, reflecting the potential risk of dynamic import misuse if inputs are manipulated externally. This is a reasonable assessment, given the utility nature of the code.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard Pulumi utility module, with functions for version parsing, environment variable access, dynamic module loading, resource registration, and decorators.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The dynamic import functions could pose a risk if external inputs are maliciously crafted, but within the context, they are controlled and typical for plugin systems.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware and obfuscated are 0, and risk is low but non-zero due to potential misuse.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and generated boilerplate.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — potential risk from dynamic imports if inputs are manipulated, but this is standard and controlled.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and justified. The code is benign, with minimal risk primarily related to dynamic import mechanisms, which are common in plugin architectures but should be handled carefully if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No concerns about malware or obfuscation; maintain awareness of dynamic import risks but overall, the code is safe.",
