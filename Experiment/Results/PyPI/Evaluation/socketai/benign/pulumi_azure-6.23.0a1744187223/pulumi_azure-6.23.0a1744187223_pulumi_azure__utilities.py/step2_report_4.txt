  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for Pulumi, handling version management, environment variables, dynamic imports, resource registration, and decorators.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Dynamic import functions could pose risks if fed untrusted module names, but in normal use, they are controlled internally.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, consistent with utility code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for Pulumi, with environment variable access, version parsing, dynamic imports, and resource registration.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior. Use of JSON inputs and dynamic imports is standard but could be risky if inputs are untrusted, though no actual malicious activity is detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for resource packages, modules, version handling, environment variables, and decorators.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or backdoors. Dynamic import functions are typical for plugin systems and are controlled.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no evident risk, though dynamic import could be a concern if misused)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for environment variables, version handling, resource registration, and SDK interaction.\n- **Findings:** No malicious indicators. Dynamic imports could be misused if inputs are untrusted, but no malicious activity is present.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Utility module for Pulumi SDK, managing resource options, dynamic imports, versioning.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or behavior. Dynamic import functions are standard utilities.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, and the code is clearly a standard utility module for Pulumi, with no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** All indicate the code is straightforward, generated boilerplate, or standard utility code—no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** The low risk scores (0.2) are appropriate, considering the use of dynamic imports and environment variables, which could be vectors if inputs are manipulated externally, but within the provided code, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical utility library for Pulumi, handling version parsing, environment variables, dynamic module loading, resource registration, and decorators.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.\n- Dynamic import functions could be risky if misused with untrusted inputs, but in this context, they are internal utilities.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent with all reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (appropriate for utility code with dynamic import capabilities, assuming controlled inputs)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard Pulumi utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score reflects potential concerns with dynamic imports if misused externally, but within this context, it appears safe.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
