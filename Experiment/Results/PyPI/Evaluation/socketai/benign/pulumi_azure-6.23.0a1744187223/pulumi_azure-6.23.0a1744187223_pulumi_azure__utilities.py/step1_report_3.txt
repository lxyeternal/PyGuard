{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for managing Pulumi resource packages, resource modules, version handling, environment variable access, and utility decorators for a Pulumi-based infrastructure-as-code framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via get_env, get_env_bool, get_env_int, get_env_float; importlib.metadata for version info; dynamic imports via lazy_import and _lazy_import_temp; user-provided resource modules and package data via JSON input; function arguments in resource constructors and call_plain.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data to external systems, files, or network connections. It mostly manages internal resource creation and version handling. No evident data leaks or untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → get_env functions; version info → _get_semver_version → get_version; dynamic import → lazy_import/_lazy_import_temp → module/classes instantiation; JSON inputs → register → resource package/module registration; resource args/opts parsing → get_resource_args_opts; function decoration and resource call → lift_output_func, call_plain.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of importlib.metadata.version, dynamic imports, and JSON-based resource registration are standard for modular frameworks. No suspicious data flows or obfuscated code detected. No external network activity or sensitive data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard resource and version management for Pulumi, including dynamic imports, environment variable parsing, version conversion, and resource registration. It employs dynamic import patterns and environment variable access, but these are typical for flexible plugin systems. No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior identified. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate utility library with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pulumi utility module used for resource management, version handling, and dynamic imports. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code is well-structured and appears intended for modular resource provider setup, with no evidence of malware or security threats.",
