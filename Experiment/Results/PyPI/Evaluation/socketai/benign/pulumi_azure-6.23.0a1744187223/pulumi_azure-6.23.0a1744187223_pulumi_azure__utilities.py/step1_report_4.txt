{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for environment variable access, version handling, resource and module registration, and interaction with Pulumi SDK for infrastructure as code workflows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (get_env, get_env_bool, get_env_int, get_env_float), importlib.metadata for package version, importlib for dynamic imports, JSON inputs for resource registration.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import functions (lazy_import, _lazy_import_temp), resource registration, and API calls such as pulumi.runtime.register_resource_package and register_resource_module.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> version extraction; resource registration data (JSON) -> resource registration functions; dynamic imports -> resource class instantiation; API calls -> resource and provider construction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets present. Dynamic import functions could potentially be misused if provided malicious module names, but this is typical for plugin systems and controlled via the input data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as utility functions for Pulumi resource management, version handling, environment variable access, and dynamic module loading. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code that would harm the host system directly. The dynamic import functions (lazy_import, _lazy_import_temp) could theoretically be exploited if malicious module names are supplied, but in normal usage, these are controlled by the package's own internal data. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The resource registration functions process JSON inputs, which could be manipulated externally, but this alone is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate infrastructure management utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a utility module for Pulumi infrastructure deployment, involving version handling, dynamic resource registration, and environment variable access. There are no malicious indicators such as network activity, data theft, or hidden backdoors. Its dynamic import functions could be a potential attack vector if misused, but within this code, they are used in a controlled manner. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
