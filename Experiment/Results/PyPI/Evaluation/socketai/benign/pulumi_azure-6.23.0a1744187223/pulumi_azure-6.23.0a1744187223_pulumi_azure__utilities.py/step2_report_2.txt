  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is primarily a utility module for Pulumi, involving version management, environment variable access, dynamic imports, resource registration, and decorators.\n   - No report indicates any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The dynamic import functions (`lazy_import`, `_lazy_import_temp`) could pose risks if supplied with untrusted module names, but in the context of this code, they seem controlled and standard for plugin systems.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - No significant logical flaws or mistakes are identified across reports.\n   - The reasoning about dynamic imports and their potential risks is accurate but contextualized as controlled.\n   - No mention of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with their conclusion that there's no malicious behavior.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are around 0.2, reflecting a cautious stance due to the dynamic import functions, which is reasonable.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward and generated code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The cautious `securityRisk` score of 0.2 is justified by the potential misuse of dynamic imports if external input is manipulated, but this is a known and controlled pattern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware or malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform network communication, system modifications, or data exfiltration.\n   - The dynamic import functions could be misused if fed malicious module names, but this is a standard pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; they all reasonably interpret the code as benign.\n   - The potential risk associated with dynamic imports is acknowledged but not overstated.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - The `malware` scores of 0 are appropriate.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are cautious but not exaggerated.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n*Reasoning:* No malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n*Reasoning:* The code is clear, generated boilerplate, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.2  \n*Reasoning:* Slight caution due to dynamic imports, but overall, the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, generated utility module for Pulumi, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The dynamic import functions are typical for plugin systems but should be used cautiously if external inputs are involved. Overall, the code is benign and safe.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Maintain the current low malware and obfuscated scores.\n- Keep the risk score at 0.2, acknowledging the potential misuse of dynamic imports but considering the controlled context.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to prepare a detailed report or further analysis.",
