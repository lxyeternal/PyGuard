  "sources": "Environment variables, importlib.metadata, importlib.util, sys.modules, resource registration functions",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import functions (lazy_import, _lazy_import_temp) that load modules based on module names",
  "flows": "Module name strings from function parameters flow into importlib.util.find_spec and importlib.util.module_from_spec",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import functions with module names supplied as strings; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated utility module for Pulumi, handling version parsing, environment variable retrieval, dynamic imports, resource registration, and decorators. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import functions could pose a risk if external inputs are manipulated, but in this context, they are controlled and standard for plugin systems. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and controlled use of dynamic imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Pulumi utility module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the potential misuse of dynamic imports if inputs are untrusted, but within this context, it is safe. Overall, the code does not pose security concerns.",
