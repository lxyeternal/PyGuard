  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for Pulumi, handling version management, environment variables, dynamic imports, resource registration, and function decoration. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, as the code is standard utility functions.\n- **Justification:** The code performs common tasks with no signs of malicious intent. Dynamic import functions could be misused if external input is untrusted, but in this context, they seem controlled.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing resource registration, version handling, and dynamic imports, with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected; the code is boilerplate for Pulumi resource management.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on resource and module registration, version handling, environment variables, and dynamic imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — perhaps even lower, but 0.2 is acceptable considering potential misuse of dynamic imports.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; the dynamic import functions are standard for plugin systems.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for Pulumi, with environment variables, versioning, dynamic imports, and resource registration. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; dynamic imports could be risky if external input is malicious, but within this code, they are controlled.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for Pulumi, versioning, dynamic imports, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; dynamic import functions are standard utilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly conservative at 0.2, reflecting the potential risk of dynamic imports if misused, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to dynamic import mechanisms that could be exploited if misused externally, but in this context, they are controlled.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign Pulumi utility library with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately conservative given the dynamic import functions, but overall, the code appears safe.",
