{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi input types and argument classes for configuring an HPC Cache with various settings, including access policies, LDAP, DNS, and identity management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from constructor parameters, class attributes, and Pulumi's internal getter/setter functions for each property.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks in this code where untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations such as system commands, network connections, or file manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs into class properties via pulumi.set, then potentially to Pulumi's resource management system. No external untrusted sources or sinks are explicitly connected within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is predominantly boilerplate, auto-generated, and solely defines data structures without any dynamic code execution, external network access, or manipulation of sensitive system resources. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The initial comment warns the file is generated and should not be manually edited, which is standard for auto-generated infrastructure code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a collection of Pulumi input type definitions for configuring cloud resources. It uses typical pattern for Pulumi classes: constructor parameters, property getters/setters, and type annotations. No external data sources, no command executions, no network calls, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be auto-generated, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All data handling follows predictable, standard practices without anomalies or suspicious code pathways.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, auto-generated set of Pulumi resource configuration classes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely structural, used for infrastructure as code deployment, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
