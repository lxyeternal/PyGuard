{
  "purpose": "Define input data structures and classes for configuring HPC Cache resources and access policies using Pulumi.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard and third-party modules; class constructors and property setters/getters; usage of Pulumi's input and output functions; class initializations with parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow from user-provided inputs to resource configuration parameters; use of Pulumi's get/set functions which handle input data; no direct data leaks or unsafe operations are evident.",
  "flows": "User inputs or configuration data flow into class constructors, which set internal attributes via pulumi.set(); these attributes may be used by Pulumi to create or modify cloud resources; no suspicious data transmission or external calls detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of code comments indicating generated code and warnings not to edit; use of deprecated or version-dependent imports; extensive boilerplate code for data classes; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be auto-generated resource input definitions for a Pulumi-based infrastructure setup. It uses typed classes, property decorators, and Pulumi's input/output functions to define resource configurations such as LDAP, DNS, Active Directory, and access policies. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The code structure and comments suggest it is intended for infrastructure provisioning, not malicious purposes. All data handling is confined to configuration parameters, with no suspicious external communications or code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of structured data classes for resource configuration in Pulumi, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code for infrastructure-as-code deployment, generated by tools. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated malicious logic.",
