{
  "purpose": "The code defines auto-generated Pulumi input types and data classes for configuring HPC Cache resources, serving as infrastructure as code boilerplate.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters and class property setters/getters used to assign configuration data; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from constructor arguments into Pulumi's internal state via set/get functions; no external commands, network calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to class properties, which are then used by Pulumi during resource provisioning; no untrusted data processing or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Comments indicate auto-generation, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of auto-generated classes for resource configuration, with data encapsulation via constructor parameters and property accessors. No runtime code executes commands, network requests, or manipulates files outside of Pulumi's internal mechanisms. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The data flow is confined to configuration data passing into Pulumi's resource model. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The comments and structure are typical for infrastructure as code boilerplate, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, auto-generated infrastructure configuration classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and standard for Pulumi resource setup.",
