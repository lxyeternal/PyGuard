  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is auto-generated Pulumi input classes for configuring HPC Cache resources. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or system modifications are present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is boilerplate for resource configuration, with no malicious activity. The high confidence and zero malware risk are justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a structured set of classes for resource configuration, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No external or malicious operations are detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code is auto-generated configuration classes with no malicious intent, no dynamic or unsafe operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous analyses; the code is purely declarative.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is boilerplate resource configuration code, with no signs of malicious activity or data exfiltration.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—resource configuration classes with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is auto-generated, purely declarative, defining resource configuration data structures for Pulumi.\n- **Malware Risk:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated logic, or external network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Security Risk:** The code does not perform any runtime operations that could introduce security risks; it only defines data models.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Justification:** The code is standard, auto-generated infrastructure-as-code definitions. It contains no dynamic code, no external data manipulation beyond configuration, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis dependency is safe. It is a boilerplate set of Pulumi resource configuration classes with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
