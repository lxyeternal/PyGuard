{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi resource classes and argument structures for managing Azure HPC Cache Blob NFS Targets, handling resource creation, lookup, and import with standard patterns.",
  "sources": "Input parameters during resource instantiation and property getters retrieving resource attributes; no external data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; data flows are internal within class constructors and property accessors, with no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into resource properties during creation; getters retrieve resource state; no external or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Auto-generated boilerplate code with standard patterns; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated Pulumi SDK implementation for managing Azure HPC Cache Blob NFS Targets. It uses typical resource class patterns, with input validation for required fields and property accessors. No external network calls, file operations, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The auto-generated comments and structure are consistent with SDK code, indicating a benign purpose. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the low inherent risk of infrastructure management code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, auto-generated SDK code for resource management with no malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use and poses minimal security risk.",
