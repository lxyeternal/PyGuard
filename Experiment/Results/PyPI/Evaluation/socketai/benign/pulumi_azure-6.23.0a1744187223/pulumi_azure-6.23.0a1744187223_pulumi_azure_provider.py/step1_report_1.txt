{
  "purpose": "The code defines Pulumi provider and argument classes for AzureRM, enabling infrastructure as code with specific configuration options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in class constructors and property setters; environment variables accessed via _utilities.get_env; file paths and secrets used for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Setting of properties that may include secrets or sensitive credentials; environment variables providing configuration data; secret handling via pulumi.Output.secret.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables and user-provided arguments flow into class properties, which may include secrets; secrets are handled with pulumi.Output.secret to prevent leakage; properties are set and retrieved via pulumi.get and pulumi.set functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pulumi.Output.secret for secret values, which is standard for secret management; environment variables used for configuration, not inherently suspicious; code comments include warning about generated code. No obfuscated language features, no suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated Pulumi classes for configuring AzureRM provider, with extensive handling of authentication secrets and environment variables. Secrets are properly masked using pulumi.Output.secret, reducing risk of leakage. There are no indications of malicious logic such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The overall structure and behavior follow standard patterns for infrastructure as code and secret management, with no suspicious anomalies. Use of deprecation warnings and environment variable defaults are typical in such configuration classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate auto-generated Pulumi provider classes for Azure, with proper secret handling and no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain any signs of sabotage or malware. Risks are limited to configuration mishandling, which is outside the scope of this review.",
