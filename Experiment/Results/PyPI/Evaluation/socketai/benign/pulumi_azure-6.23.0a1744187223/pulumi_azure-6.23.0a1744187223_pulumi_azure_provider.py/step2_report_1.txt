  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators of Supply Chain Attack:**\n   - All reports describe auto-generated Pulumi classes for AzureRM provider configuration.\n   - They handle secrets securely using Pulumi's secret outputs (`pulumi.Output.secret`) and environment variables.\n   - No network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are mentioned.\n   - Warnings about deprecated properties and comments about code generation are typical and benign.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Reasoning Mistakes:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the purpose of the code as configuration and secret management.\n   - They acknowledge the use of environment variables and secret wrappers, which is standard practice.\n   - No logical inconsistencies or malicious assumptions are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting typical configuration code with some secret handling, but no evident security issues.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.9–0.95), consistent with the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**\n   - The malware scores are appropriately zero; no adjustments needed.\n   - The risk scores are low but not zero, considering the handling of secrets and environment variables—this is reasonable.\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities based on assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard configuration.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is auto-generated, well-structured, and follows best practices for secret management.\n   - No signs of sabotage, malware, or supply chain compromise.\n   - The environment variable defaults and deprecation warnings are normal maintenance signals, not malicious.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal risk, mostly configuration handling)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, the code is legitimate, auto-generated Pulumi provider code for Azure, with proper secret management and no malicious behavior. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Estimated Score | Justification                                                  |\n|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors observed.   |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Clear, well-structured, auto-generated code with no obfuscation. |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1–0.2           | Standard secret handling, environment variable usage, no vulnerabilities. |\n\n**Final Note:** No further action is necessary. The supply chain risk from this dependency appears negligible.",
