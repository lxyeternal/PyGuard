  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and assess the potential security risks, malware presence, obfuscation, and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is auto-generated Pulumi classes for AzureRM provider, with proper secret handling (`pulumi.Output.secret`) and environment variable defaults. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both set to 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code's purpose is configuration, secrets are masked, and no suspicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing secure secret handling, environment variables, and standard patterns. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2 (low), Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is typical infrastructure configuration code, with secrets handled securely and no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard Pulumi provider classes with secret management, environment variables, and no suspicious external activity. Warnings about deprecated properties are normal.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration and secret handling, with environment variables and Pulumi secret wrappers. No malicious logic or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with proper secret management and no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—resource classes with secure secret handling, environment variables, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or sabotage logic:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward and auto-generated.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Low, reflecting configuration code handling secrets properly.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a typical, auto-generated Pulumi provider class for Azure, focusing on configuration, credential management, and environment variable defaults. Secrets are handled securely with Pulumi's secret wrappers (`pulumi.Output.secret`), and no suspicious external activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The environment variable defaults and deprecation warnings are standard maintenance practices.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slight risk due to configuration complexity and secret handling, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, secure, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the detailed analysis.",
