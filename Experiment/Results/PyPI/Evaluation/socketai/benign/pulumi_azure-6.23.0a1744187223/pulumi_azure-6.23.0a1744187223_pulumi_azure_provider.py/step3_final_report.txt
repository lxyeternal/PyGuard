{
  "purpose": "The code defines auto-generated Pulumi classes for AzureRM provider configuration, handling secrets securely via Pulumi's secret outputs and environment variables for defaults. It manages various authentication parameters and resource registration options, facilitating infrastructure deployment with proper secret and credential management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for defaults (e.g., AZURE_ENVIRONMENT, ARM_METADATA_HOSTNAME, ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID), input parameters for secrets and configuration, Pulumi secret outputs for sensitive data.",
  "sinks": "Pulumi secret outputs (e.g., pulumi.Output.secret) for secrets; environment variables for configuration defaults; property getters and setters for resource properties.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (secrets, environment variables) flow into Pulumi secret outputs and resource properties; environment variables provide default values when parameters are not supplied; secrets are wrapped with Pulumi's secret functions to prevent exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard secret handling; use of deprecated properties with warnings; no network calls, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated Pulumi provider class for Azure, managing credentials and configuration parameters securely. Secrets are handled via Pulumi's secret outputs, environment variables supply defaults, and the structure follows best practices for infrastructure as code. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code's purpose is configuration management, with no external network activity or suspicious logic. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. It handles secrets securely and uses environment variables appropriately. The supply chain security risk from this dependency appears negligible, and no further action is necessary.",
