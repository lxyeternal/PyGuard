{
  "purpose": "The code defines auto-generated Pulumi classes for Azure resource feature configurations, encapsulating various resource parameters and options in a declarative manner.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters and property setters/getters within Pulumi classes, which set and retrieve configuration data via pulumi.set and pulumi.get methods.",
  "sinks": "Internal state management within Pulumi's framework; no external data sinks, network calls, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor arguments into internal Pulumi state via pulumi.set, and from internal state to property getters via pulumi.get, with no external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is auto-generated, with standard comments warning against manual edits.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Pulumi resource configuration classes for Azure features, following a consistent pattern of parameter initialization and property accessors. No malicious behavior, external system interactions, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is confined within the framework, serving purely as infrastructure as code (IaC) configuration. The auto-generated nature and lack of any suspicious code or data leaks justify a very low security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is benign, auto-generated IaC configuration code for Azure resources. It contains no malware, backdoors, or obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
