{
  "purpose": "This code defines various Pulumi input types and argument classes for configuring Azure resource provider features, including options for resource management, soft delete policies, and resource-specific configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters from function arguments and class properties, such as resource deletion flags, soft delete policies, and resource-specific settings.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence resource deletion policies, soft delete behaviors, or configuration states, but no direct external data sinks like network connections or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into class properties via setters; properties are retrieved via getters, with no indication of untrusted external data influencing critical actions beyond parameter assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains comments warning it was auto-generated by Pulumi Terraform Bridge, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. No obfuscation or code injection is evident. No hidden network or system calls are detected. The code is purely declarative configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Pulumi resource configuration classes with type annotations, constructors, and property getters/setters. It defines resource-specific configuration options with optional parameters and no dynamic code execution or external system interactions. The warnings about being auto-generated are typical for infrastructure code. No malicious logic, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms are apparent. The code is consistent with standard patterns for Pulumi resource configuration and contains no suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated set of Pulumi configuration classes for managing Azure resource provider features. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It solely handles configuration data with no external or harmful actions embedded.",
