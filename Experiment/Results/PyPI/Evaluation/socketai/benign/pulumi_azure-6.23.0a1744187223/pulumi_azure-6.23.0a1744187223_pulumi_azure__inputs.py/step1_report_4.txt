{
  "purpose": "This code defines Pulumi input types and argument classes for configuring Azure resource provider features in a declarative infrastructure-as-code setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters for resource configuration, including environment variables and function arguments for resource management.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the code mainly sets and gets resource configuration parameters within the Pulumi framework.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through class constructors and property setters/getters, primarily within the infrastructure configuration context. There are no external network or system command executions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment indicating it was auto-generated by Pulumi Terraform Bridge (tfgen), which is a standard tool and not suspicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. All methods and properties are straightforward. No backdoors, suspicious domain calls, or malicious data leakage routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a collection of Pulumi classes for defining resource feature configurations, employing type annotations and optional parameters. It uses standard Pulumi patterns for resource property management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be purely declarative, designed for infrastructure provisioning, with no hidden or malicious commands, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Its origin as auto-generated by a known tool reduces suspicion of tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated Pulumi resource configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is purely declarative, intended for setting resource properties in cloud infrastructure provisioning.",
