{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based unit tests verifying the correctness of murmurhash2 and murmurhash3 functions with predefined inputs and expected outputs.",
  "sources": "The test functions read input strings encoded as UTF-8 and the fixed seed value; no external data sources or user inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks; it only asserts hash outputs against known values.",
  "flows": "Input strings are encoded and passed to hash functions; the outputs are compared to expected values; no data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, deterministic test suite for hash functions, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. It imports hashing functions from a third-party module, which could be a concern if the module is compromised, but the code itself performs only static testing. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite verifying hash functions. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
