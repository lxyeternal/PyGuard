{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the correctness of murmurhash2 and murmurhash3 hash functions using pytest.",
  "sources": "The code reads the predefined input strings for hashing in test cases.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data; it only performs hash function assertions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are encoded and passed to hash functions; results are compared to expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing framework pytest and two hash functions. It sets a seed value. It defines parameterized tests for both hash functions, verifying output against expected hash values for various input strings. The code appears standard for testing hashing functions, with no indication of malicious behavior or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This source code solely tests hashing functions with predefined data and expected outputs. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward test suite.",
