{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the correctness of murmurhash2 and murmurhash3 hashing functions with predefined inputs and expected outputs.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the parameterized test cases (keys), which are hardcoded string literals.",
  "sinks": "Uses the murmurhash2 and murmurhash3 functions as sinks, but these are standard hashing functions likely from a third-party library.",
  "flows": "Input strings are encoded and passed to hashing functions, and the resulting hash values are compared to expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be standard test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports test functions from pytest and custom hashing functions from 'murmurhash2'. It defines a fixed seed and runs parameterized tests on multiple string inputs, asserting that the hashing functions produce expected hash values. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling. The functions tested are standard hashing functions used for data structures or checksum purposes, not malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test suite for verifying the correctness of murmurhash functions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended for development or testing purposes.",
