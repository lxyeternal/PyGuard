{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the murmurhash2 and murmurhash3 hashing functions, verifying their outputs against expected hash values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the test parameters (string keys).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; the code only performs hash computations for testing.",
  "flows": "Input strings are encoded and passed to hash functions, with the results compared to expected values; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscation or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing libraries and hash functions, then runs parameterized tests on these hash functions with predefined input-output pairs. No data is retrieved from external sources or written to external systems. The code performs straightforward testing of hashing functions, which are assumed to be legitimate. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test suite for hashing functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only verifies expected hash outputs and does not perform any unsafe operations.",
