{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest test cases for the murmurhash2 and murmurhash3 functions, used to verify hash outputs for specific inputs.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'murmurhash2' module, test input parameters, and the pytest framework itself.",
  "sinks": "Assertions within test functions; no direct data output or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Test input parameters flow into hash functions, and their output is compared against expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code appears to be straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports hashing functions and uses pytest for parameterized testing. It defines a constant seed and verifies that the hash functions produce expected outputs for various inputs. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The code structure is standard for test cases, with no obfuscated or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of test cases verifying hash function outputs, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
