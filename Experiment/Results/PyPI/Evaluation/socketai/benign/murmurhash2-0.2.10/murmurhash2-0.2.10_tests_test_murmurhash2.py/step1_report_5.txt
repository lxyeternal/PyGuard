  "purpose": "Unit testing for murmurhash2 and murmurhash3 hashing functions with predefined test vectors.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameterized test cases (the 'key' strings).",
  "sinks": "Assertions that compare hash outputs; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input keys are encoded and passed to hashing functions, and results are compared to expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Uses standard pytest framework with no suspicious imports or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports hashing functions and defines parameterized tests to verify their correctness against known hashes. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The imported 'pytest' module is standard for testing; the hashing functions are imported from a library called 'murmurhash2', which appears to be a legitimate hashing implementation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. The code strictly performs unit testing on hashing functions with static input data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate unit testing code with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply verifies the correctness of hashing functions with predefined inputs and expected outputs. There are no suspicious behaviors or security risks identified.",
