  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages states, exceptions, and results within the Prefect system. It handles exception formatting, retries result fetching, and creates various state objects.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code detected. The code uses standard Python features and external modules appropriately.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are 0, justified by the lack of malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing utility functions for state management, exception handling, and result persistence.\n- **Findings:** No external untrusted input processing, no malicious network calls, no obfuscation. The code interacts with result stores and exception formatting securely.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high confidence).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears safe and standard for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on exception-to-state conversions, result handling, and state creation functions.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious constructs. Use of UUIDs for result keys is standard.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical utility for state management, with no malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages state transitions, exception handling, and result retrieval.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no suspicious code. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar focus on state management, exception handling, and result persistence.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted input execution, no malicious network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard, safe utility module.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks across all reports.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the findings.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are 0 or very low, reflecting no significant security concerns.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, given the detailed reasoning and consistent findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\nBased on the code review and reports:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security vulnerabilities or malicious patterns identified.\n\n**Note:** The code is a well-structured utility for state management within a workflow orchestration system, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The overall risk assessment should remain at **0** for malware and obfuscation, with a very low or zero security risk score.",
