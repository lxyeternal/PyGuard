  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for managing workflow states within the Prefect system. It does not contain malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from interactions with external result stores and the use of UUIDs, which are standard and safe. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and appropriate for supply chain use in this context."
