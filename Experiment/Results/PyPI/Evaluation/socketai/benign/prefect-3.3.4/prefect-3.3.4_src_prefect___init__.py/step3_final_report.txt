  "purpose": "Module initialization, version info, path constants, and controlled dynamic attribute loading via __getattr__.",
  "sources": "Reads internal module attributes (__spec__, _build_info, __file__). No external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via importlib based on predefined mappings; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Attribute name from __all__ or __getattr__ triggers import of internal modules; no external data flows into the system.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for lazy import is standard; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. Path manipulations are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup with version info, path constants, and controlled dynamic imports. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The dynamic import pattern relies on internal mappings, minimizing risk. No external inputs influence import paths. The use of __spec__ is typical and controlled. Overall, the code is well-structured, safe, and follows common patterns for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package initialization script with controlled dynamic imports. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The low risk score (0.1) reflects the minimal inherent risk associated with dynamic import mechanisms in a controlled environment.",
