  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code initializes constants, manages import paths, and dynamically loads attributes based on a predefined API mapping.  \n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Dynamic imports are controlled via mappings, reducing risk. Path manipulations are standard.  \n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate given the controlled dynamic import pattern.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe, standard for package initialization, with high confidence.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing version info, paths, and controlled dynamic imports.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns; dynamic import via controlled API. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; code is standard.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on versioning, paths, and dynamic imports based on __spec__ and internal mappings.  \n- **Findings:** Use of __getattr__ with importlib is typical; no signs of malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware is 0; security risk is 0.2, which is reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard internal setup, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—initialization, lazy loading via __getattr__, controlled by internal API.  \n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk low (0.1).  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, controlled dynamic import pattern.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Describes module setup, lazy loading, controlled via __all__ and internal variables.  \n- **Findings:** No external input handling or suspicious patterns; import paths are internal and fixed.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, consistent with controlled dynamic imports.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports confirm that the code is a standard module initialization pattern, primarily managing internal API exposure, version info, and lazy module loading via controlled __getattr__ and importlib.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports identify obfuscation or malicious code. The dynamic import pattern is controlled and based on predefined mappings, which is common and safe in well-structured packages.  \n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern is reliance on __spec__ for dynamic import paths, but in a controlled environment, this is standard and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Scores & Justification:\n\n| Aspect             | Score | Justification                                                                                         |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0**   | No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is purely for internal API setup. |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0**   | No obfuscation present; code is straightforward and readable.                                         |\n| **Risk**          | **0.1** | Very low; controlled dynamic imports and internal paths minimize risk. Slightly above zero due to reliance on __spec__, but this is standard. |\n\n**Note:** The small non-zero risk score accounts for the use of dynamic import based on __spec__, which could be exploited if __spec__ were manipulated externally, but in typical, controlled environments, this is not a concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured package initialization script.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Dynamic imports are controlled via predefined mappings, minimizing risk.\n- The overall security posture is very high.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores. No changes necessary. The code is safe and typical for internal package setup.",
