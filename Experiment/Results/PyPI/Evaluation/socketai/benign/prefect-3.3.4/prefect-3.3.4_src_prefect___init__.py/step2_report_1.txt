  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard module initialization, version info, path constants, no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses importlib for dynamic attribute access based on predefined mappings; no untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** Controlled dynamic import via static mappings; no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, typical package setup. No malicious code or malware signals. High confidence (0.95). Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.1 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—module setup, version, paths, API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import via __getattr__, controlled by internal API dictionary.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic import always carries some risk, but here it's based on internal mappings.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior. Safe, standard pattern. Confidence 0.9. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—module initialization, version, paths.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import via __getattr__, based on __spec__ and internal mappings.\n- **Anomalies:** Potential concern if __spec__ is manipulated externally, but generally controlled.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected. Standard pattern. Confidence 0.9. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, internal API, version info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Lazy loading with __getattr__, controlled import paths.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of __getattr__ for lazy import is common; risk if attribute names are externally manipulated—here, they are predefined.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior. Safe pattern. Confidence 0.9. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—module setup, dynamic imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Controlled dynamic import via attribute names in __all__.\n- **Anomalies:** No external data influencing import paths.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity. Confidence 0.9. Malware: 0. Obfuscated: 0. Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior (score 0). The code only performs controlled dynamic imports based on predefined mappings.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly higher in some reports (0.2), but given the controlled nature of dynamic imports and absence of external inputs, the risk remains low (~0.1–0.2).\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk in dynamic import patterns, but controlled here)\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured package initialization script, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The dynamic import mechanism is used safely within controlled mappings, and no external data or secrets are involved.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the pattern observed across all reports.",
