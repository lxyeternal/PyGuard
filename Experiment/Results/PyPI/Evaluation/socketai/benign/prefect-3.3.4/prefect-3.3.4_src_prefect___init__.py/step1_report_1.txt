{
  "purpose": "This code initializes module-level constants, manages import paths, and dynamically loads attributes for a Python package, primarily to facilitate API exposure and module referencing.",
  "sources": "Reads the module's own __file__ attribute, import statements, and type hints.",
  "sinks": "Uses importlib.import_module to dynamically import modules or attributes based on predefined mappings; no direct handling of untrusted input data.",
  "flows": "Attribute access via __getattr__ triggers dynamic imports, which may load code modules but are based on predefined mappings, not untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute loading with importlib; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs; paths are relative and based on __file__, standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module constants and path variables, importing necessary modules and managing dynamic attribute access via __getattr__. The _public_api dictionary maps attribute names to module paths for import. Dynamic imports are based solely on predefined mappings, reducing risk of arbitrary code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Path manipulations are standard for package structure. No suspicious network or file operations are present. The dynamic attribute loader relies on controlled mappings, limiting potential exploitation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization script, with dynamic attribute loading based on predefined mappings. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code structure is typical for Python modules managing complex APIs and lazy loading. Overall, it is safe with a high confidence level.",
