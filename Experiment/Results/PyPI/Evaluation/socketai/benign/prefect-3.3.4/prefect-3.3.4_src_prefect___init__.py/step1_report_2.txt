{
  "purpose": "The code sets up module metadata, path constants, type annotations, and dynamic attribute importing for a Python package, mainly for internal API and version management.",
  "sources": "The code reads internal build info, module path data, and dynamically imports attributes based on an API dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import in __getattr__ can potentially execute arbitrary modules or attributes if manipulated, but this is controlled by the API mapping.",
  "flows": "Code reads internal info -> sets constants -> on attribute access, dynamically imports modules and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import (__getattr__) is normal but can be exploited if external input influences attribute names. The code itself does not show such influence, but reliance on dynamic import always carries some risk. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version and path constants from build info and module path, defines an API mapping for internal modules, and implements __getattr__ for lazy attribute importation. The dynamic import mechanism is controlled via a predefined API dictionary, reducing risk. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of importlib for on-demand module loading is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoor functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with dynamic attribute loading, not exhibiting malicious behavior. It is designed for internal API management and version handling. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
