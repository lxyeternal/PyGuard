{
  "purpose": "The code defines module-level constants, type annotations, and dynamic attribute access for a Python package, primarily serving as an interface to internal modules and paths.",
  "sources": "Reads module attributes, importlib imports based on dynamic attribute names, and accesses build info from _build_info.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module calls with dynamic attribute names, accessing __spec__.parent, and potentially executing code upon import.",
  "flows": "Attribute lookup via __getattr__ triggers importlib.import_module, which loads internal modules based on dynamic string composition.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic imports based on attribute names, which could potentially be manipulated if the attribute names are controlled externally, but in this context, the attribute names are predefined in __all__ and internal variables. No evidence of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up module metadata and dynamically imports internal submodules using importlib based on attribute requests. The dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ allows lazy loading of modules, which is a common pattern in Python packages. The use of __spec__.parent to determine package paths appears safe given controlled attribute names. No external data inputs or untrusted sources are used in a way that could lead to code injection or malicious execution. The import paths are statically derived from internal variables, and the dynamic import mechanism is limited to known attribute names listed in __all__. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Overall, the structure and content do not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard module interface with lazy loading of internal modules. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. The dynamic import mechanism is controlled and does not appear exploitable in this context.",
