  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code initializes module constants, manages internal paths, and dynamically loads attributes via __getattr__.\n- Dynamic imports are based on a predefined _public_api mapping, which is controlled.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code relies on internal attributes like __spec__, which is standard in Python modules.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The dynamic import mechanism appears safe given the controlled mappings.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Describes standard module initialization and dynamic attribute loading.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that dynamic imports are based on predefined mappings, limiting arbitrary code execution.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, considering dynamic import risk), confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing internal API setup.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes that dynamic import is controlled via a dictionary, reducing risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The slight increase in risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the use of dynamic import, but it's still low.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, focusing on versioning and internal paths.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights potential risk if __spec__ is tampered with but notes that in normal conditions, it's controlled.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The concern about __spec__ is valid but unlikely in a controlled environment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar module setup and lazy import via __getattr__.\n- **Analysis:** Emphasizes that import paths are fixed and internal, minimizing risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others, focusing on module interface.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that dynamic import is limited to known attribute names, reducing risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Judgment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is standard package initialization with controlled dynamic imports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; all are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) is justified due to dynamic import mechanisms, but overall, the risk is minimal.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — dynamic import based on controlled mappings, typical in Python packages, with minimal risk.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the potential (though minimal) danger inherent in dynamic imports, but overall, the code is standard and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
