  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exceptions and utility functions (e.g., traceback trimming). No malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration detected.\n- **Analysis:** The traceback trimming function removes frames from specified modules, which is standard for debugging. Exception classes mainly wrap external errors or internal states. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0. The code is purely for structured error handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed. The code is safe and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on exception classes and traceback utilities. No malicious intent detected.\n- **Analysis:** The traceback removal utility is a common debugging aid. Exception classes serve to structure error information.\n- **Score justification:** Malware is 0, no security risk. The code's purpose is clear and benign.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes and traceback utilities, with no suspicious external activity.\n- **Analysis:** The traceback trimming function is used to improve error reporting. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and purpose-driven.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on error handling and traceback utilities.\n- **Analysis:** Traceback trimming could potentially hide internal details, but in this context, it’s a debugging utility. No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Score justification:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0.1 (a small concern due to traceback hiding, but still benign).\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign; the utility function is standard.\n\n**Recommendation:** Slightly increase confidence to 1.0; the code is clearly safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes and traceback utilities, with no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Traceback manipulation is intended for cleaner error reports, not malicious concealment. No suspicious external calls or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0.2 (due to potential misuse of traceback hiding, but unlikely malicious).\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the traceback trimming utility is legitimate.\n\n**Recommendation:** Maintain the current assessment; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0. All code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally very low, as the code is primarily exception handling and traceback utilities, which are standard debugging and error reporting tools.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code’s core functionality revolves around structured error handling, traceback manipulation for cleaner error reports, and custom exceptions to categorize errors within the Prefect framework. These are common practices in robust library design. No external data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The traceback trimming utility, while potentially used to hide internal frames, is a legitimate debugging aid and does not constitute malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (a slight concern due to traceback hiding, but acceptable given context)\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\nThis code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
