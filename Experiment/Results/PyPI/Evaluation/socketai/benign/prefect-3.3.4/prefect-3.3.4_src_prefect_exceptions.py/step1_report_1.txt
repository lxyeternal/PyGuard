{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and utility functions for error handling within the Prefect workflow automation framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements, exception class definitions, utility functions (_trim_traceback, exception_traceback).",
  "sinks": "Exception raising and string formatting in exception classes; traceback manipulation; error message construction.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and traceback formatting occur in various exception classes, with no external data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; utility functions operate on traceback objects; exception classes mainly structure error info.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured error handling through custom exceptions and traceback management. The _trim_traceback function carefully removes frames from specific modules, which is a standard debugging aid. The exception classes include mechanisms for converting validation errors and HTTP errors into user-friendly messages. No indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. The only notable activity is traceback manipulation, which is a typical debugging practice, not malicious behavior. The code's structure is consistent with library design for error management, with no suspicious logic or external data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It mainly defines exception handling classes and utility functions for error processing. No harmful behavior or supply chain sabotage signals are detected.",
