  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and utility functions for error handling within the Prefect framework.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs include exceptions, traceback objects, module objects, function signatures, and HTTP errors.",
  "sinks": "String representations of exceptions, traceback formatting, or error messages that could leak internal data or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Exceptions and error messages are formatted and returned, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks without validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads are present. The traceback trimming function is a utility to clean tracebacks but not malicious itself.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various custom exceptions for error handling in the Prefect framework, along with utility functions for traceback manipulation. The traceback trimming function selectively removes frames from specified modules, which could be used to hide internal implementation details, but this is a standard debugging utility. All exception classes are straightforward, providing clear error categorization without including any malicious code or hidden behaviors. No data exfiltration, network activity, or other malicious actions are present. The HTTP error class formats error responses safely. Overall, the code appears to be purely for structured error handling and does not contain malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of structured exception definitions and utilities for error handling within Prefect. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The traceback trimming utility could potentially be misused to hide internal frames, but in this context, it seems intended for debugging purposes. Overall, the package appears secure and benign.",
