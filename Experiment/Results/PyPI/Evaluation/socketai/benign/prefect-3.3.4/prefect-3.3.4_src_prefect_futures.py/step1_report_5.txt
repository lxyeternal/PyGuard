  "purpose": "This code provides an abstraction for handling asynchronous task and flow run futures within the Prefect framework, enabling waiting, result retrieval, and callback registration.",
  "sources": "Read operations occur in properties (e.g., task_run_id, state, flow_run_id), methods calling external APIs (get_client, read_task_run, read_flow_run), and async functions (wait_async, aresult, result_async). It also reads futures' final states and status from Prefect API.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows into result and wait methods, which process task/flow states and results. No direct sinks of untrusted input are evident. The API calls and state properties could potentially leak sensitive task/flow IDs if misused, but that is expected behavior rather than malicious.",
  "flows": "Sources like get_client.read_task_run/read_flow_run → state checks → wait_async or result_async → final state or exception. Async waiting functions listen for task/flow completion and update internal state. Callbacks are invoked after task/flow completion. No evidence of untrusted data influencing control flow maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings in PrefectFuture.__init__ and task_run_id property. Use of get_client in multiple places is expected for API interaction. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The presence of async/await constructs, threading.Event, and partial functions are normal for concurrency control.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a structured async/future pattern within the Prefect orchestration framework, with mechanisms to wait for and retrieve task/flow results. It uses external API calls to read statuses, supports concurrent operations, and manages callbacks. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are present. The only possible concern is reliance on external API calls which could be manipulated if the environment is compromised, but that is outside the scope of this module. The code does not handle sensitive credentials or insecure operations. It uses warnings and standard async patterns appropriately.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of asynchronous future handling within the Prefect framework, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It securely manages task and flow statuses, relies on external APIs for state information, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic.",
