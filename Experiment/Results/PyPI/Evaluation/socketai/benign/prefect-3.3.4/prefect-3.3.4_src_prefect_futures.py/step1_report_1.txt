{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for managing and handling asynchronous task and flow run futures within the Prefect orchestration system, including waiting, retrieving results, and handling completion callbacks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the Prefect API client (e.g., read_task_run, read_flow_run), from the wrapped futures (e.g., add_done_callback), and from internal state variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data from task or flow run states, results, or callback functions that could be executed upon completion.",
  "flows": "Futures acquire state from the Prefect API and invoke callbacks or wait for completion; callbacks can execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warning messages; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no explicit code injection or unsafe SQL; use of async and threading appears standard. No obfuscated code detected; no suspicious domain or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various future classes for handling task and flow run states asynchronously, including integration with Prefect API clients, threading, and async utilities. The futures manage state checking, waiting, and callback invocation securely, relying on Prefect's API and internal async mechanisms. No indication of malicious payloads, network communication with suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code appears structured for reliable asynchronous orchestration with appropriate error handling and warnings about deprecations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured implementation of Prefect's asynchronous future management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily interacts with Prefect's API and handles async flow control, with no evidence of sabotage, malware, or privacy violations.",
