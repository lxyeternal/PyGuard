      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for managing workflow states within the Prefect system. It does not contain malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from interactions with external result stores and the use of UUIDs, which are standard and safe. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and appropriate for supply chain use in this context."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured part of Prefect's async orchestration system, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation is absent, and the low security risk score is justified. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The main concern is the execution of untrusted code, which is an accepted aspect of plugin architectures, not indicative of malicious activity."
