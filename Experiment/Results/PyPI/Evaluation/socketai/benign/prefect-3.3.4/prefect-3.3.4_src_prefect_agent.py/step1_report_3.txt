  "purpose": "Provides a dynamic attribute getter for migration purposes in Prefect 3.0.",
  "sources": "Import from 'prefect._internal.compatibility.migration', use of '__getattr__' to dynamically fetch attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no output or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dynamic attribute access is controlled via 'getattr_migration'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__getattr__' with a function returned by 'getattr_migration' is a dynamic feature; however, it appears to be standard for plugin or migration handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a special '__getattr__' function that uses 'getattr_migration' to handle attribute access dynamically based on module name. This is a typical pattern in plugin or migration systems to handle missing attributes gracefully. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious data flows. The import is from a specific internal module related to compatibility and migration, which aligns with version upgrade messaging. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for dynamic attribute handling during migration in the Prefect framework. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
