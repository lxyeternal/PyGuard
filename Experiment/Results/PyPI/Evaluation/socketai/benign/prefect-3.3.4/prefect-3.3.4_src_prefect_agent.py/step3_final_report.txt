  "purpose": "Provides dynamic attribute access handling for migration compatibility in Prefect 3.0.",
  "sources": "Import of 'getattr_migration' from internal Prefect module; assignment to __getattr__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external inputs or outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'getattr_migration' -> assignment to __getattr__ for dynamic attribute resolution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ at module level is unusual but acceptable for compatibility; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility function for migration support and assigns it to __getattr__, enabling dynamic attribute access. It is straightforward, purpose-driven, and contains no malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns. No external data, network activity, or secrets are involved. The pattern is common in plugin or compatibility layers, and the code's simplicity indicates low risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for migration compatibility in Prefect 3.0. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1.",
