{
  "purpose": "Provides a dynamic attribute getter for migration compatibility in Prefect 3.0",
  "sources": "Import from 'prefect._internal.compatibility.migration' and the module name (__name__)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a dynamic attribute function",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to dynamically assign an attribute getter function; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'getattr_migration' from a Prefect internal module, then assigns it to __getattr__, which is a special method name used for dynamic attribute access. This pattern is common for providing compatibility shims or dynamic attribute resolution. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The code appears to be a straightforward, purpose-driven implementation for handling migration-related attribute access. The import path and function usage are legitimate and not suspicious. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation for managing dynamic attribute access related to Prefect migration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
