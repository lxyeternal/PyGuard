  "purpose": "Provides a dynamic attribute getter for migration compatibility in Prefect 3.0",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'getattr_migration' from a internal compatibility module",
  "sinks": "Assignment of __getattr__ using 'getattr_migration', which could be invoked during attribute access",
  "flows": "Accessing attributes of the module may invoke '__getattr__', calling 'getattr_migration'",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to dynamically assign attribute behavior; reliance on internal compatibility module; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a compatibility function 'getattr_migration' and assigns it to '__getattr__' for dynamic attribute access. This setup is typical for providing backwards compatibility or migration support. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and limited in scope. It does not process external input directly nor contain any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for dynamic attribute handling within a library, aimed at supporting migration. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation appears legitimate and safe.",
