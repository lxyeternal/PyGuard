{
  "purpose": "The code analyzes Python source code to tokenize it, map variables, and handle multiline statements for code analysis or transformation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source lines from input parameter 'source_lines', reads tokens generated by the 'tokenize' module, and inspects token types and content.",
  "sinks": "Processes tokens for variable and keyword identification; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Tokenizes source lines -> maps tokens to lines and variable names -> processes tokens to identify structure -> collapses multiline lines; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of undocumented internal 'generate_tokens' function is noted but is a known workaround, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs tokenization, variable mapping, and multiline line joining with warnings for mismatched tokens. It employs standard Python modules and functions for code parsing, with no indication of malicious intent. It neither executes untrusted code nor connects externally. The only potential concern is the use of an internal 'generate_tokens' function, but this is documented as a workaround. No malicious payloads, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for analyzing and tokenizing Python source code. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and there are no security risks observed in the implementation.",
