  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static analysis utility for Python source code, focusing on tokenization, variable mapping, and handling multiline statements.\n- No reports mention any external data transmission, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior.\n- The code uses an internal 'generate_tokens' function from the 'tokenize' module, which is an undocumented but known workaround for tokenizing strings.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**1. Code correctness and issues:**\n- The code appears well-structured for its purpose.\n- No issues are found in the logic or implementation.\n- The only minor concern is the use of an internal 'generate_tokens' function, which is documented as a workaround, not malicious.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The warnings for token mismatches are appropriate for debugging, not security issues.\n\n**3. Scores assigned:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports, justified by the benign description.\n- SecurityRisk: Very low (0.1 to 0.2), consistent with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated: 0, correct as the code is straightforward.\n\n**4. Potential vulnerabilities:**\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly identifies the code as a static analysis utility.\n\n**5. Consistency:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's behavior.\n- The scores align with the described purpose and operations.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The use of 'generate_tokens' is noted but not considered malicious.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is clearly for code analysis, not for executing or transmitting untrusted data.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** No malicious activity is present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **Should remain at 0.** The code is clear and well-structured.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **Should be very low, around 0.1 to 0.2.** The current scores are appropriate.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The use of undocumented internal functions warrants a minor note but does not impact security.\n- The code is a legitimate static analysis tool with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                   | No malicious behavior or payloads detected.                |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                   | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                    |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1 - 0.2           | Very low risk, benign static analysis utility.            |\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, intended for static analysis, and contains no malware or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a consolidated report summary based on this analysis?**",
