  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code behavior, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a static utility for tokenizing Python source code, mapping variables, handling multiline statements, and annotating tokens.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or system modifications are present.\n- Uses standard library modules (`tokenize`, `warnings`, `keyword`, `collections`).\n- Employs an internal, undocumented workaround (`generate_tokens`) but this is a known, documented technique for string input.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code's purpose aligns with static code analysis, tooling, or parsing.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Clear, consistent with code.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified; no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, perhaps slightly high for a benign utility, but considering the use of internal functions, acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no issues. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0, aligns with benign static analysis utility.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, very low, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same, consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same, consistent.\n- **Malware score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware.\n- The risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the consistent analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher than 0 for minimal caution is acceptable, but they are justified as very low.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 or lower, given the benign nature and standard library usage.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes necessary. The code is a safe, legitimate static analysis utility with no malicious or obfuscated behavior detected.",
