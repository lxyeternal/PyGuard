  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, examining the reasoning, the evidence presented, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code analyzes Python source code for tokenization and variable mapping.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, no external data flow, uses internal 'generate_tokens' workaround.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Finds the code benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score: 0. Justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behavior is identified. The use of internal 'generate_tokens' is documented and not malicious. The low security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static analysis, tokenization, variable mapping.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity, standard library usage, no external data flow.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Again, the code is deemed benign with high confidence (0.95). Malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no signs of malicious intent. The security risk is very low (0), matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static code analysis, tokenization, mapping.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, use of undocumented 'generate_tokens' noted but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), benign utility, malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The undocumented 'generate_tokens' is a known workaround, not malicious. The low security risk aligns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Tokenization and code structure analysis.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, standard tokenization, no external data flow.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), benign, malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent reasoning, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static analysis, tokenization, variable mapping.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, standard techniques, undocumented 'generate_tokens' is a known workaround.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1), benign utility, malware score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough; no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None. All reports agree.\n- **Use of undocumented 'generate_tokens':** Noted but justified as a known workaround, not malicious.\n- **External data flow or network activity:** Absent.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious constructs:** Not observed.\n- **Malware score justification:** Consistently 0 across all reports, justified by the benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, well-documented code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, given the benign analysis)\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The only minor point is the use of internal 'generate_tokens', which is a known workaround but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall assessment aligns with the reports. The code is a legitimate static analysis utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the evidence.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and keep the risk score very low (around 0.1–0.2).",
