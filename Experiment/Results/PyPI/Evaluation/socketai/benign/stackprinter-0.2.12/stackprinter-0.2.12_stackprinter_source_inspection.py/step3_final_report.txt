  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for tokenizing Python source code, mapping variables, and handling multiline statements.",
  "sources": "Reads source code lines; tokenizes using 'tokenize.generate_tokens' on string input.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or system modification; purely in-memory processing.",
  "flows": "Source code lines → tokenization → variable mapping and annotation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses undocumented 'generate_tokens' workaround, but this is a documented technique for string tokenization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static tokenization and variable mapping with no malicious payloads or external data flows. The use of internal 'generate_tokens' is a known workaround, not malicious. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured and intended for code analysis purposes. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2). The scores assigned in the reports are justified and appropriate.",
