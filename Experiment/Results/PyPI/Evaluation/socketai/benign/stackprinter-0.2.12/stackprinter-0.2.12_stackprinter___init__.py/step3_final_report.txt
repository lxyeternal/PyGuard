{
  "purpose": "The code provides traceback formatting, display, and exception hook management utilities, including IPython integration, for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Exception objects, sys.exc_info(), sys._getframe(), threading.Thread objects, environment variables, and internal traceback modules.",
  "sinks": "Formatted traceback strings are output to stdout, stderr, or files; potential leakage of sensitive info if exceptions contain secrets.",
  "flows": "Sources such as exception info or frames flow into formatting functions, which produce strings that are then printed or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Use of sys._current_frames() can leak sensitive data during debugging but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of debugging utilities for traceback and exception formatting, with support for IPython. It manipulates internal traceback mechanisms primarily for improved user experience. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The only inherent risk is potential leakage of sensitive data via traceback info, which is typical for debugging tools but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility designed for traceback and exception handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal and mainly related to the exposure of sensitive data during debugging, which is an accepted trade-off in such tools.",
