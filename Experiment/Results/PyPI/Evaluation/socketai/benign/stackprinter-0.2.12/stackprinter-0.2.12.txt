The scores are consistent with its behavior: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to reliance on external modules and source inspection. Overall, it is safe and suitable for debugging purposes."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward debugging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor logical flaw in exception handling is not security-related but could affect error visibility. The use of sys.settrace() poses a potential misuse risk if left enabled in production, but in this context, it is used appropriately for debugging. Overall, the code is safe and legitimate."

The presence of masking and error handling features are typical for debugging tools and do not indicate malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is safe, utility-focused, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The current security scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a minimal risk score, are appropriate. Minor adjustments to set the security risk score to 0 across all reports are recommended to reflect the benign nature."

The low security risk score (0.1) is justified by source inspection capabilities but does not constitute a threat. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary."
