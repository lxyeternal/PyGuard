{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for formatting and displaying Python exception tracebacks and stack frames with customizable styles and details.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from traceback objects, frame objects, and exception instances, including environment variables in error handling.",
  "sinks": "Formats and outputs strings to the caller, potentially to logs or console; no direct data leaks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Source data (traceback, exception info, frames) flows into formatting functions which process and generate styled string representations for display or logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Uses dynamic style selection but no obfuscated code or unusual language features. No malicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code offers multiple formatting utilities for Python traceback and stack frame information, with options for style, detail level, and output formatting. It reads traceback and frame data as input and produces styled string outputs. Error handling involves catching exceptions within the formatting functions and including fallback messages. No signs of malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of environment variables for debugging is controlled and not inherently malicious. The dynamic style and formatting do not introduce security risks. Overall, the code appears purely for debugging and display purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate traceback and stack frame formatter intended for debugging, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code, and it mainly processes internal data structures for user-friendly output.",
