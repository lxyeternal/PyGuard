{
  "purpose": "The code provides various formatting functions for stack traces and exception information, primarily for improved readability and presentation.",
  "sources": "Reads input from traceback objects, exception objects, frames, and user-supplied formatting options.",
  "sinks": "Uses formatted strings and color schemes for output; potential sinks include string concatenation and printing to consoles or logs.",
  "flows": "Traceback objects are iterated to gather frames; exception info is recursively processed; formatted strings are generated and concatenated for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident. No malicious network activity or data exfiltration code is present. Uses external modules without suspicious imports. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically formats stack traces and exceptions for display purposes, using helper modules and functions. It retrieves traceback information, formats frames, and manages recursion for chained exceptions. The code performs string manipulation and uses color schemes for styling output, with no indication of malicious intent. It relies on standard libraries (traceback) and custom modules (stackprinter.*), which appear legitimate. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are found. The code does not execute external commands, network activity, or write to system files. It focuses solely on formatting and presenting traceback info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate traceback formatting utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It primarily enhances readability of exception traces for debugging and does not contain any malicious payload or suspicious activities.",
