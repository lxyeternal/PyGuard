{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for formatting and displaying Python stack traces, exception info, and frames with various styles and options.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include exception objects, traceback objects, frame objects, and function parameters such as style, flags, suppressed variables, and paths.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are string concatenations and formatting functions that generate traceback and exception messages, which are returned or displayed. There are no direct data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from traceback/frame sources through formatting functions, with exception and traceback info being recursively processed, formatted, and then output as strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code performs expected traceback formatting. It uses external modules for formatting but does not execute untrusted code. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and specific external modules for stack printing. It provides functions for formatting tracebacks, exception info, and frames, with options for styles and summaries. The functions handle nested exceptions, support reverse order, and avoid executing untrusted data directly. The use of external modules for color schemes and frame extraction appears legitimate. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The code is well-structured, primarily formatting and string handling, with no suspicious flows or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate traceback and exception formatter with configurable styles. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Its purpose is to enhance traceback readability and presentation, with no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
