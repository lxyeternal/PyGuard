  "purpose": "The code provides functions for formatting stack traces and exception information for debugging and display purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads traceback objects, frames, exception attributes, environment variables, and styling modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions; primarily formatting output.",
  "flows": "Sources (traceback, exception info, environment variables) flow into formatting functions which generate display strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of 'PY_STACKPRINTER_DEBUG' environment variable is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward traceback and exception formatter, utilizing external styling modules and environment variables solely for debugging. No network activity, code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The environment variable is used in a benign context. The code's purpose is purely for presentation and debugging, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for formatting traceback and exception info. It poses no security threat or malware risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are consistent with its benign nature.",
