  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'stackprinter', including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; package discovery via setuptools.find_packages()",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows leading to execution of untrusted data or code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified; setup script primarily defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for documentation, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, no untrusted inputs, and no external data injections. The code performs standard setup tasks typical for Python packaging, with no suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
