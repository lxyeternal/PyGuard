  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'stackprinter' Python package, involving reading a README file and invoking setuptools.setup() with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static data passed to setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Reading local file -> passing static arguments to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, no dynamic behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README.md file for long_description and calls setuptools.setup() with static, well-formed metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network operations, or obfuscated patterns. The code follows standard practices and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior. All signals indicate a benign, safe script with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals and reports are consistent and accurate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
