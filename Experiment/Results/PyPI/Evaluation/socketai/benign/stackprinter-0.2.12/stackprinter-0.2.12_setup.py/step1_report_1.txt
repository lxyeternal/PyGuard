  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'stackprinter', including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description, and setup parameters such as package info, author, and URL.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks or security-impacting operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into 'long_description', which is then used in setup, but this is a standard pattern.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code follows standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a Markdown README file for detailed description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and configuration. There are no obfuscated patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or system operations. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
