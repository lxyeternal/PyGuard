{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for inspecting and extracting detailed source information from Python stack frames or traceback objects, primarily for debugging or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source code via inspect.getsourcefile, inspect.getfile, and inspect.findsource; accesses frame locals and globals; and processes variable names and their values.",
  "sinks": "Assigns variable values to the 'assignments' dictionary, including untrusted or unresolved attributes; no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Source code and variable data flow into source parsing, variable lookup, and assignment collection; no evidence of data being sent over network or manipulated maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code's functionality appears aligned with debugging tools; use of try-except for attribute lookups is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects stack frames and traceback objects to extract source code, variable states, and source mapping. It handles different frame types, retrieves source code lines, and resolves variable references, including complex attribute lookups. The lookup function handles missing or complex attributes gracefully. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The presence of debugging utility functions and safe variable handling suggests legitimate intent. No anomalous patterns like hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling were observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a debugging aid that inspects source code and variable states in stack frames. It does not contain malware, malicious backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It performs safe variable lookups and source extraction, aligned with debugging practices. No security threats or malicious intent are detected.",
