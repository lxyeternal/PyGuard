{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for inspecting Python stack frames, extracting source code, variable states, and attribute resolution for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Source code is read from the current frame or traceback via inspect.getsourcefile, inspect.getsourcelines, and related functions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed locally for debugging and source inspection.",
  "flows": "Source code is retrieved and tokenized; variable names are looked up in local/global scopes; attribute chains are resolved via getattr; data flows from source code and variable scopes to internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling; classes like CensoredVariable and UnresolvedAttribute for masking or error representation are benign debugging aids, not malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python introspection modules for source and frame analysis, with exception handling to manage missing source or attribute errors. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The classes for variable masking and unresolved attributes serve debugging and privacy purposes. The code's structure and logic are consistent and safe for debugging contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate debugging utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It handles source extraction, variable lookup, and attribute resolution safely. The presence of masking and error handling features are typical for debugging tools and do not indicate malicious activity.",
