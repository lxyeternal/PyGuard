{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to inspect and extract detailed source and variable information from Python stack frames or tracebacks, likely for debugging or introspection purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include frame objects, traceback objects, and source files accessed via inspect and linecache modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are variable lookups (getattr), source code retrieval, and data storage in custom classes, but no untrusted data is used in security-sensitive functions like network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source frames/traces through get_source, get_vars, and lookup functions, ultimately populating FrameInfo with variable states and source code tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code contains standard introspection and variable handling logic. No obfuscated code, cryptic functions, or misleading constructs are present. The only unusual element is the placeholder for censored variables and unresolved attribute containers, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs source code analysis, variable extraction, and frame inspection using standard Python introspection modules. It retrieves source lines, annotates tokens, and attempts variable lookups, handling exceptions gracefully. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions serve debugging and introspection purposes, with no suspicious network or system activity. The code's operations are consistent with intended debugging tools and do not exhibit malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate introspection utility designed for debugging or educational purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It safely handles source extraction and variable inspection without executing untrusted code or network operations.",
