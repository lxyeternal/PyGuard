  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes for inspecting Python stack frames and tracebacks to extract source code, variable states, and related metadata for debugging or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading source code via inspect.findsource, inspect.getsourcelines, and source maps; accessing frame.locals and frame.globals; retrieving filename and function information from frame objects.",
  "sinks": "Accessing frame.locals and frame.globals to retrieve variable values; constructing string representations of variables, including potentially sensitive or large data.",
  "flows": "Source code and variable data are read from source files and frame objects; variable values are looked up via the lookup() function, which traverses attribute chains; variable information is collected into assignments and passed into FrameInfo objects for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code defines a class CensoredVariable that masks variable values with '*****' for suppressed variables, but does not include explicit hardcoded credentials or malicious backdoors. The UnresolvedAttribute class captures failed attribute lookups, which might sometimes be used to hide information, but by itself, this is not suspicious. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No obfuscated or intentionally malicious constructs are evident. Exception handling is broad but typical for introspection functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for stack frame and source inspection, commonly used in debugging tools. It reads source files, extracts variable values, and constructs detailed frame information for display. The use of source maps and variable lookup functions is straightforward and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. No network activity, file system tampering, or hidden backdoors are present. The masking of variables via CensoredVariable is a privacy feature, not malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code intent. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate debugging utility with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard source and stack frame inspector with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely retrieves source code, variable states, and frame information, primarily for debugging or visualization purposes. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident. The design and implementation are typical for debugging tools.",
