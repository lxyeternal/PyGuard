{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for formatting and representing various Python objects, including collections, arrays, and callables, primarily for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from objects passed as parameters to formatting functions such as format_value, format_dict, format_iterable, format_array, and inspect_callable.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are present. No untrusted data outputs or network communication are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects into formatting functions, which produce string representations; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code primarily handles safe string formatting, with no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of various functions for converting objects into string representations, including handling of collections, numpy arrays, and callables. It performs checks for object types, manages nesting depth, and formats output accordingly. The numpy import is optional and used only for array formatting, with no unsafe operations. The functions utilize safe repr and str calls to prevent exceptions. No input/output operations, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code does not contain obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured utility module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for object formatting and string representation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations, data exfiltration, or backdoor activities.",
