{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for formatting and representing various Python objects, including containers and numpy arrays, for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "It reads object values through function parameters, inspects callables via 'inspect_callable', and imports numpy if available.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks are present; the code mainly formats data for display, with no data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves receiving objects as input to formatting functions, processing them, and producing string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The code appears standard for object formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on formatting objects for display, including handling of lists, dicts, tuples, sets, numpy arrays, and callables. It uses standard library functions and numpy methods, with safe string representations to avoid exceptions. There are no signs of suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior. No external data transmissions, network calls, or hidden backdoors are present. All functions serve transparent formatting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for safe and formatted object representations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
