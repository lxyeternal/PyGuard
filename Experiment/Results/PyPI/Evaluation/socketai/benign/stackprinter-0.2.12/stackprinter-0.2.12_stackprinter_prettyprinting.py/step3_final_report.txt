  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting Python objects into strings, including containers, numpy arrays, and callables, primarily for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Object attributes, container items, numpy array data, callable inspection via 'inspect_callable'.",
  "sinks": "None; internal string formatting without external data transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input objects are processed through type checks and formatting functions, with potential source info from 'inspect_callable' used for callables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Use of 'inspect_callable' could leak source file locations but is standard for debugging utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe string conversions, handles various object types, and employs exception handling to prevent crashes. It does not execute external code, access network, or modify files. The use of 'inspect_callable' is for reflection, not malicious activity. No obfuscation patterns are present. The security implications are minimal, mainly potential source location exposure during debugging, which is typical and not harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for object formatting with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified by source inspection capabilities but does not constitute a threat. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
