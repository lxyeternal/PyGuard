{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for formatting and stringifying various Python objects, including containers, numpy arrays, and callables, primarily for debugging or display purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses internal data structures and object attributes. Imports from standard libraries and 'stackprinter' modules, but no data is fetched from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions like 'inspect_callable' and 'safe_repr'/'safe_str' that could potentially execute or invoke methods on objects, but these are standard safe practices. No untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No external input flows into untrusted sinks. Formatting functions process internal data, with no data transfer or transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The code is purely formatting and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of formatting functions intended for representing objects as strings with control over layout, truncation, and depth. It imports 'numpy' optionally, and uses 'stackprinter' modules for inspecting callables. No external input or output operations are performed, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The functions perform standard string manipulation, representation, and object inspection tasks without executing untrusted code or performing any network or system modification activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for debugging or object visualization. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It relies on safe practices for object inspection and string formatting.",
