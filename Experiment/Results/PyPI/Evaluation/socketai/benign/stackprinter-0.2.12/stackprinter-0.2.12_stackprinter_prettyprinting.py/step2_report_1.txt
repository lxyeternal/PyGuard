  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: actual code behavior, potential security concerns, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of utility functions for object formatting, with no network, file, or system modifications.\n- The code uses safe practices: safe_repr, safe_str, and optional numpy import.\n- The code inspects callables via `inspect_callable`, which retrieves source info but does not execute code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are evident.\n- The code is purely for debugging or display purposes.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility for formatting objects.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Security risk:** 0.0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility, with numpy support.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Also accurate. Slightly higher security risk due to reliance on `inspect_callable`, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Formatting functions, no external input/output.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (negligible)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Object formatting, no external data transfer.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Formatting, inspecting callables, no external transmission.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (minimal)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily due to `inspect_callable` revealing source info, but this is standard debugging info, not a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n- The low security risk reflects the fact that the code could leak source info via `inspect_callable`, but this is typical for debugging utilities and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (due to source info exposure, but not a real vulnerability)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is a safe, standard utility module for object formatting, with negligible security concerns.",
