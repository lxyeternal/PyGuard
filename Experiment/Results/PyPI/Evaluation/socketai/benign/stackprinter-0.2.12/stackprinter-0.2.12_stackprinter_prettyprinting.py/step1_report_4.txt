{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for formatting and stringifying various Python objects, including containers and numpy arrays, with options for truncation and line wrapping.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are mainly function parameters and imported modules. No explicit external input reading or network operations are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that send data to external systems, networks, or file writes. No direct data leakage or system command execution points are identified.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to data transformation within functions, converting objects into formatted string representations. No untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is straightforward, focusing on object formatting and safe string handling without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules securely, with fallback handling for numpy. It defines multiple functions for safely converting objects to strings, formatting containers, and handling numpy arrays. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system modifications are evident. The use of inspect_callable suggests some reflection on callables, but it appears to be for informational purposes only, not malicious. The functions perform string manipulation, truncation, and line wrapping, all of which are benign. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for object formatting with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external data transmission, system compromise, or covert operations. Overall, it appears to be safe, well-structured, and intended solely for debugging or display purposes.",
