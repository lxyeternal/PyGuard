{
  "purpose": "The code provides a debugging utility that traces function calls, returns, and exceptions, printing detailed stack information for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input from sys._getframe(), inspect.getsourcefile(), and inspect.getfile().",
  "sinks": "Uses print_function (default: print) to output formatted trace information. No untrusted data processing or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Frame data is retrieved from stack frames and passed to formatting functions; trace function calls print output via print_function, and no external data sinks are used.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward, with proper use of debugging features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a tracing utility using sys.settrace, which monitors function call, return, and exception events, printing detailed information about each event. It uses inspect to obtain source file info and avoids tracing its own code. The formatter functions are imported from external modules and used to format output. There are no signs of malicious data handling or backdoors. The code focuses solely on debugging and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The exception handling in enable disables tracing if another trace is active, preventing conflicts but not malicious. Overall, the code is a debugging tool with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a debugging utility that traces function execution flow. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely for debugging purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
