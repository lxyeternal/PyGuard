  "purpose": "A debugging utility that traces function calls, returns, and exceptions using sys.settrace() and frame inspection.",
  "sources": "sys._getframe(), sys.gettrace(), inspect.getsourcefile(), inspect.getfile()",
  "sinks": "print_function (or custom output function), format_exception_message, format_value",
  "flows": "Frame data flows into show() which formats and outputs call/return/exception info",
  "anomalies": "In __exit__, the method returns True only if no exception occurred, which suppresses exceptions unintentionally; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard debugging techniques with sys.settrace() to monitor function calls and exceptions, outputting formatted information via a customizable print function. It filters source files to avoid internal frames and manages call depth for indentation. The only notable anomaly is the exception suppression in __exit__, which may hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose aligns with debugging and tracing, with potential information leakage if sensitive data is printed, but this is typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward debugging utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minor logical flaw in exception handling is not security-related but could affect error visibility. The use of sys.settrace() poses a potential misuse risk if left enabled in production, but in this context, it is used appropriately for debugging. Overall, the code is safe and legitimate.",
