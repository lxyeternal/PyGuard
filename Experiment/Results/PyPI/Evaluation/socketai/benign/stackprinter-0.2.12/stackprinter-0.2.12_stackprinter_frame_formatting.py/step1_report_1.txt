{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for formatting and displaying stack frames, source code snippets, and variable states during debugging or exception handling, with optional color enhancements for readability.",
  "sources": "Imports modules 'types', 'os', 'collections', and 'stackprinter' submodules. No user input, network, or environment variable access detected.",
  "sinks": "Formatting functions and string concatenations are used, but no clear sink for untrusted data that could lead to security vulnerabilities. No code injection or data leaks apparent.",
  "flows": "Source data (frame info, source code, variable values) flows into formatting functions which produce formatted string outputs; no untrusted data flow to external systems or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard formatting and source inspection logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides detailed formatting classes for stack frames and source code highlighting, with optional color schemes. It performs source code extraction, variable inspection, and source code display with customizable options. No user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions mainly manipulate and format data for display purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage mechanisms. The code is well-structured, intended for debugging and visualization, with no suspicious or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of frame and source code formatting for debugging tools. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage, nor does it exhibit obfuscation or malware. The code is safe and primarily focused on visualization.",
