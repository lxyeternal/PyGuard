  "purpose": "Classes for formatting stack frames, source code snippets, and variable states, primarily for debugging and visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source files, frame info, callables, and variable data within the current process; no external input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "String formatting and concatenation for display; no external data transmission or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source code and frame info into formatting functions, resulting in formatted strings for display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides debugging utilities for displaying source code, variable states, and traceback info, with optional color styling. It relies on standard modules and external functions like 'ex.get_info' but does not perform any network, file tampering, or code injection. The logic is straightforward, focusing on formatting and presentation. No signs of sabotage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is standard and does not leak sensitive info. The code is well-structured and safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging and formatting utility with no malicious intent or sabotage. It does not perform any external communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The scores are consistent with its behavior: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to reliance on external modules and source inspection. Overall, it is safe and suitable for debugging purposes.",
