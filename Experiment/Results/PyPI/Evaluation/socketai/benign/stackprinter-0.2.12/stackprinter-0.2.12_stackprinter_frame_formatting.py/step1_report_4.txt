{
  "purpose": "The code provides formatting classes for stack frames and tracebacks, primarily used for enhanced error reporting and debugging, including colored output options.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (types, os, collections) and from internal stackprinter modules (extraction, source_inspection, colotheschemes, prettyprinting, utils). No external user input or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no network connections, file writes, or external data exfiltration. Formatting functions generate strings only for display.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources flow into sensitive sinks; data flows are confined to local variable formatting and string composition for traceback presentation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is focused on formatting and color schemes. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for formatting traceback frames with optional color highlighting. It handles source code snippets, variable display, and source scope selection. The code uses standard patterns for formatting and colorization, with no external data inputs or side effects. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are evident, such as network activity, data theft, or code injection. The only potential concern might be the use of color schemes and dynamic string generation, but these are safe in context. Overall, the code is purely presentational with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of formatting utilities for traceback display, with optional colorization. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign, well-structured formatting module without indicators of sabotage or malware.",
