{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for formatting and displaying stack frames and tracebacks with optional color styling, primarily for debugging and error reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from frame objects, including filename, line number, function name, source code snippets, and variable values via ex.get_info, fi.source_map, fi.assignments, and fi.line2names.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and formats variable values and source code snippets, but does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or execute untrusted code directly.",
  "flows": "Frame data (frame, lineno) is processed via ex.get_info to extract source and variable info; this info is then formatted into strings for display, with optional color styling; no data is sent externally or stored.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic string formatting and relies on external functions for extracting frame info; no obvious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code includes detailed formatting logic but no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of classes designed for detailed and configurable formatting of stack frames and tracebacks, with optional colorization. It reads data from frame objects and source maps, then formats this data for display. No external data transmission, credential handling, or system modifications are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file tampering, or hidden backdoors. The only potential concern is the use of external functions like ex.get_info, which are assumed to be safe; however, without their implementation, their safety cannot be guaranteed. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate debugging aid with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard traceback and stack frame formatter with optional coloring, designed for debugging and logging. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage features, nor does it perform any external harmful actions. The overall security risk is very low.",
