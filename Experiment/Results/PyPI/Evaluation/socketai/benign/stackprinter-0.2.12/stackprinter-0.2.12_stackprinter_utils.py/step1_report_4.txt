{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for pattern matching, inspecting callable objects, trimming source code indentation, and generating ANSI escape codes for colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Patterns provided to the 'match' function; functions passed to 'inspect_callable'; 'source_map' and 'context' inputs for 'trim_source'; parameters 'hue', 'sat', 'val' for 'get_ansi_tpl'.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write untrusted data directly to output or external systems; 'match' could potentially process malicious pattern inputs, but it's limited to regex matching. 'get_ansi_tpl' generates terminal color codes without external side-effects.",
  "flows": "Input patterns to 'match' are used to search strings; functions inspected by 'inspect_callable' provide metadata; 'trim_source' processes source code lines; 'get_ansi_tpl' converts HSV values to ANSI codes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior is observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The code performs standard utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions: 'match' for regex matching, 'inspect_callable' for introspection of functions/methods, 'trim_source' for removing indentation from source lines, and 'get_ansi_tpl' for creating ANSI escape sequences. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are present. The functions operate locally and are safe. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious patterns. It does not perform any harmful actions or include malicious payloads. The code is safe and intended for source code analysis, pattern matching, or terminal coloring purposes.",
