{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for pattern matching, function inspection, source code trimming, and ANSI color code generation.",
  "sources": "Code reads function objects (`f`) via inspection, source map data (`source_map`), and context lines (`context`). No untrusted external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The only output is ANSI escape codes generated in `get_ansi_tpl`, which are used for terminal color formatting; no data leaks or system modifications occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code mainly processes internal data and generates formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform pattern matching with regex, inspect functions to retrieve metadata, trim source code based on indentation, and generate ANSI color codes from HSV values. All operations are straightforward, with no external data sources or network communication. The source inspection does not access sensitive system info; ANSI code generation is safe for terminal display. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving utility purposes related to code inspection, formatting, and display. It does not contain malware or security risks. No anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
