  "purpose": "Utility functions for pattern matching, inspecting callables, trimming source code indentation, and generating ANSI color codes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as strings, functions, source maps, and color parameters; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external system interactions, data leaks, or untrusted data processing; purely internal operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through regex matching, reflection, source trimming, and color code generation without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises benign utility functions operating solely on provided parameters. No network, file I/O, or code execution beyond attribute inspection occurs. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, utility-focused, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The current security scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a minimal risk score, are appropriate. Minor adjustments to set the security risk score to 0 across all reports are recommended to reflect the benign nature.",
