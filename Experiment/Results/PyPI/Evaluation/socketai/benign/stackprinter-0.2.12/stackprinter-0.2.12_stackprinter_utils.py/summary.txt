  "conclusion": "The code is safe, utility-focused, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The current security scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a minimal risk score, are appropriate. Minor adjustments to set the security risk score to 0 across all reports are recommended to reflect the benign nature."
