{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for string pattern matching, function inspection, source code trimming, and color formatting for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'string', 'patterns', 'f', 'source_map', and 'context'; also attributes accessed within functions like '__self__', '__func__', '__qualname__', and code object properties.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted input leading to data leaks or security effects are present. The code generates terminal color escape sequences but does not interact with external systems or files based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input strings and patterns are processed within 'match'; callable objects are inspected in 'inspect_callable'; source code snippets are trimmed in 'trim_source'; color parameters are converted into ANSI escape codes in 'get_ansi_tpl'. There are no evident data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks that cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are identified. The functions perform standard utilities without obfuscation or hidden mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of utility functions: 'match' performs regex pattern matching on strings, 'inspect_callable' inspects callable objects to retrieve metadata, 'trim_source' removes extraneous indentation from source code snippets, and 'get_ansi_tpl' generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal coloring. None of these functions handle sensitive data or external inputs in a manner that poses security threats. They do not involve network activity, file operations, or execution of untrusted code. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be benign utility functions used for string processing, code inspection, and terminal color formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain sabotage, or security risks within this code snippet.",
