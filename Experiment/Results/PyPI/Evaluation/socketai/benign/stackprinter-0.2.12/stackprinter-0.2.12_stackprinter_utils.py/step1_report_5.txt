{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for string pattern matching, inspecting callables, trimming source code indentation, and generating ANSI escape sequences for colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include string parameters for match(), source_map and context parameters in trim_source(), and function objects in inspect_callable().",
  "sinks": "The code constructs ANSI escape sequences in get_ansi_tpl() which are used for terminal coloring, and potentially returns inspection data from inspect_callable().",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed for pattern matching; function objects are inspected for metadata; source_map and context are used to generate trimmed source snippets; hue, sat, val parameters are converted into ANSI codes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions perform typical utility operations with no side-effects or external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions for pattern matching, function inspection, source code trimming, and ANSI escape sequence generation. None of the functions perform actions that could harm the system or leak data. There are no hardcoded secrets, external calls, or malicious constructs. The inspect_callable() function retrieves function metadata without executing code. trim_source() adjusts source code snippets for display, and get_ansi_tpl() generates terminal color codes. Overall, the code appears benign, focused on formatting and inspection tasks without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for inspection, string processing, and terminal coloring, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and primarily useful for debugging or display purposes.",
