  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions: pattern matching, inspecting callables, trimming source code, and generating ANSI color codes.\n- No external system interactions, network activity, or file I/O are present.\n- The functions operate solely on input parameters and internal data.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The only potential concern is the use of ANSI escape sequences, which is benign in terminal formatting contexts.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review**\n\n#### **1. Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Clear that code is benign, utility functions, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The high confidence and zero malware/security risk are justified.  \n- The mention of \"no signs of malicious intent\" aligns with the code.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores as-is.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, utility functions, benign, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The security risk is set at 0.1, which seems conservative but acceptable given the use of ANSI codes.  \n- No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential Adjustment:**  \n- Since no external interactions or malicious patterns are present, consider lowering `securityRisk` to 0, unless the context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, utility functions, benign, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Similar reasoning applies.  \n- The small security risk is acceptable but could be zero.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no malicious activity, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Fully justified.  \n- No concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign, utility functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Obfuscated=0, Confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Again, the security risk is minimal.  \n- Since no external or malicious activity, could consider lowering to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Scores & Recommendations**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk | Confidence | Notes |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            | 0.95       | Appropriate |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0 (or 0.1)   | 0.9        | Slightly conservative; can be 0 |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1 (or 0)   | 0.9        | Same as above |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            | 1.0        | Appropriate |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.1 (or 0)   | 0.95       | Same as above |\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**  \n- All functions are straightforward, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- The use of ANSI escape sequences is benign.  \n- No external data or network activity.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Set `malware` scores to **0** for all reports.  \n- Set `securityRisk` scores to **0** unless specific context suggests otherwise.  \n- Maintain high confidence levels.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Security Risk:** **0** (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.0–0.1)  \n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe code is a set of benign utility functions with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are mostly appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider context. If in a supply chain context, even benign code can be exploited if integrated into larger malicious workflows, but based solely on this snippet, the risk is negligible.",
