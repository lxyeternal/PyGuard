{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for pattern matching, inspecting callable objects, trimming source code indentation, and generating ANSI color codes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters such as 'string', 'patterns', 'f', 'source_map', and 'context'. No external untrusted sources are read directly within this code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include regex matching results, function attribute access, string manipulation, and terminal color code generation. The color code generation outputs terminal escape sequences, which are benign.",
  "flows": "Input data (patterns, source_map, context) flows through pattern matching, source code inspection, and indentation trimming functions. No data flows into network, file system, or other external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions with clear purposes: 'match' performs regex pattern matching, 'inspect_callable' inspects function objects for metadata, 'trim_source' trims indentation from source lines, and 'get_ansi_tpl' generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal colors. All functions operate solely on provided parameters without external data or network interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the generation of terminal escape sequences, which is benign and intended for formatting terminal output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activities. Overall, the code appears safe.",
