  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and if any scores need adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines color schemes for UI/theming, with deterministic color generation via seed-based randomization. No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Findings:** All observations are accurate. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior. The only external call is to `get_ansi_tpl`, which is for formatting ANSI escape sequences—standard for terminal coloring.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The report's assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is for color schemes, with no external data or malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Correct. The code is purely for visual theming, with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code defines color schemes, with seed-based color generation, no external data, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Correct. The only external function is `get_ansi_tpl`, which is used for formatting, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; no malicious activity, just color schemes and visualization.\n- **Findings:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity, just color schemes and visualization.\n- **Findings:** Correct. The code is purely for UI theming.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is purely for color theming and visualization.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final expert estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign utility for defining color schemes with deterministic randomization for visual consistency. No suspicious activity, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
