  "purpose": "Provides Django-specific utilities for rich command line help formatting, including a custom formatter and a function to set this formatter as default for Django commands.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.core.management.base, rich_argparse._argparse, and rich_argparse._patching; reading django modules and setting default formatter class.",
  "sinks": "The function _patch_default_formatter_class potentially modifies the behavior of BaseCommand.create_parser, which affects command-line parsing.",
  "flows": "richify_command_line_help() imports BaseCommand, then calls _patch_default_formatter_class to patch create_parser method with the custom formatter class.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. The code is straightforward utility setup.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for Django installation, defines a custom rich help formatter, and provides a function to globally patch Django commands to use this formatter. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detected. The patching function affects command help formatting, not data processing or network behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility to enhance command help display in Django projects. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It is safe and intended for improving user experience.",
