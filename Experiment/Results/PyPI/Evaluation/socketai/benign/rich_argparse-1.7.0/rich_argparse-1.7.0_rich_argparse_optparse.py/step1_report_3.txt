  "purpose": "This script configures and displays a command-line argument parser with customized help formatting and options.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via command-line arguments; uses __main__ block for execution.",
  "sinks": "Uses parser.print_help() to output help message, which is a safe operation. No untrusted data handling beyond argument parsing.",
  "flows": "Input from command line -> argument parser -> potential help message output; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of regex in help formatter appears benign. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific formatting classes and sets up an OptionParser with custom options and groups. It appends a regex pattern to highlights, which is a benign configuration. The main block creates parser options, including help descriptions with emojis and links, then calls print_help(), a standard function. No code injection, external network calls, or malicious data handling is present. No hidden or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for command-line argument parsing with custom formatting. No malicious activity or security risks identified.",
