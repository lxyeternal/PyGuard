{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility to patch the default formatter class used by argument parser classes, primarily for customizing help message formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from function calls and class attributes, particularly when patching classes or methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly output or send untrusted data; it modifies class behavior internally.",
  "flows": "The flow involves receiving class or function references, checking callability, wrapping methods to modify 'formatter_class' parameter, and applying patches.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code uses standard Python features and is well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for patching a class method or acting as a decorator to patch classes. It ensures that the patched method is callable, wraps it to modify 'formatter_class' parameter, and applies the patch. There is no code injection, external network activity, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a utility for enhancing or customizing existing classes, with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for patching or decorating classes to modify their default formatter class, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
