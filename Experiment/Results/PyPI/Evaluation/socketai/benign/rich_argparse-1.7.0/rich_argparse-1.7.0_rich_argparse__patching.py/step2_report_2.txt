  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a utility for patching classes to set a default formatter. It notes no malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. The confidence is perfect (1). This seems appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code performs standard method patching without any malicious intent. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** The report acknowledges the potential risk in modifying class methods but concludes that the code is benign. It assigns a Security Risk of 0.1, citing possible exploitation via class or method name overrides.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1. The malware score is appropriate as no malicious activity is present. The security risk is marginally elevated due to the nature of runtime patching, which could be misused if misapplied.\n- **Justification:** Since the code only modifies class methods to set default parameters, and no external data or network activity occurs, the risk is minimal. The small security risk score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, emphasizing the benign nature, standard method patching, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior; the code is a utility for internal customization.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior, no malicious activity, straightforward method patching.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also confirms benign utility, standard Python patterns, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Scores:** The only slight variation is in report 2, which assigns a small security risk (0.1). This is justified given that runtime patching can be misused, but in this context, it’s minimal and acceptable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to potential misuse of patching techniques, but no actual threat)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard utility for class method patching, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The small security risk score in report 2 is justified but does not indicate an actual threat.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider context and usage. In this case, the code is safe, but runtime patching techniques should be used carefully in security-sensitive environments.",
