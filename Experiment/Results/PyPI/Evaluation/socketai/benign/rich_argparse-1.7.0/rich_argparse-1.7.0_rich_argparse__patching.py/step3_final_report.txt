  "purpose": "A utility to patch class methods, specifically to set a default formatter class for argument parsers or similar classes.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to the function, class attributes, and method references within the class to be patched.",
  "sinks": "The patched class method (__init__ or specified method) which now automatically includes a default 'formatter_class' argument.",
  "flows": "The decorator or function call modifies the class method to inject 'formatter_class' as a default argument before execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external data leaks, no network activity, and no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that can be used as a decorator or a direct function call to patch a class method (like __init__). It retrieves the specified method, wraps it to set a default 'formatter_class' argument, and replaces the original method. The code uses standard Python techniques for method wrapping and class modification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The patching mechanism is controlled and safe, intended for internal customization of argument parser classes or similar. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for patching class methods to set default arguments, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe for use in production environments.",
