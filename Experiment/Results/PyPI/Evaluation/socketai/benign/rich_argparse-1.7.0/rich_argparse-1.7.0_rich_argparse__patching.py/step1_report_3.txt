{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to patch or override the default formatter class used in argument parser classes, primarily for enhancing help message formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and rich_argparse._argparse, functions `patch_default_formatter_class` and its internal decorator.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data processing or output; no external data transmission or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only modifies class methods at runtime for formatting purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility to patch the method of a class (typically argument parsers) to set a default formatter class. It uses standard Python features like decorators, functools, and attribute setting. It operates at the class/method level to alter behavior for formatting help messages. No external network activity, data leakage, or malicious instructions are present. The code does not process external input data or execute any untrusted code; it solely modifies class methods at runtime for formatting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for patching argument parser classes to improve help message formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
