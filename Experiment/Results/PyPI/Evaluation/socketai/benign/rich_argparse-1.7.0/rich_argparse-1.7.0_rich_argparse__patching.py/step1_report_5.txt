{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility function to patch the default formatter class used by argument parser classes, enabling customization of help message formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads class objects and their methods, specifically accessing and modifying method attributes. It does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies class methods by wrapping them, which could affect how argument parsers behave but does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves passing class objects to a decorator or function, retrieving the specified method, wrapping it to inject a default parameter, and then replacing the original method with the wrapper.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code uses standard Python features such as decorators, method wrapping, and attribute setting. It does not include hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that can act as a decorator or a regular function to patch classes by replacing their specified method (defaulting to '__init__') with a wrapper that sets a default argument. It ensures the method is callable and properly wraps it, maintaining original metadata via functools.wraps. The implementation is straightforward, using common Python patterns for method patching. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for patching argument parser classes, intended to modify help formatter behavior. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
