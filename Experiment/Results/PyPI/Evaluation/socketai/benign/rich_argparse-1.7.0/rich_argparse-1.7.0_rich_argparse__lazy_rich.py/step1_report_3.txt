{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an internal module for managing imports and exposing specific attributes related to the 'rich' library, primarily for code organization and lazy loading.",
  "sources": "Import statements (standard library imports and conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING); dynamic import inside __getattr__ function.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted data or include network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only dynamically imports modules and updates globals based on attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "The __getattr__ function dynamically loads and exposes attributes from the 'rich' library, which is typical for lazy loading but not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. The dynamic import pattern is common and benign in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module that provides conditional imports for the 'rich' library components, deferring actual module loading until attributes are accessed. The __all__ list explicitly states the exposed attributes. The __getattr__ function dynamically imports modules from 'rich' only when needed and updates the global namespace accordingly. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The pattern used is consistent with lazy loading for performance or modular design. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a lazy loader for a library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defers importing 'rich' components until accessed, which is a common design pattern.",
