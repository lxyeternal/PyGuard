  "purpose": "Provides a controlled interface for accessing components of the 'rich' library via lazy loading with __getattr__, avoiding immediate imports.",
  "sources": "Attribute access triggering __getattr__, which imports 'rich' submodules when needed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Attribute access -> __getattr__ -> dynamic import -> globals update -> attribute return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ for lazy import is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled, lazy importing of 'rich' components upon attribute access, updating the global namespace accordingly. It contains no external input handling, network activity, or data exfiltration. The pattern is a standard Python technique for deferred imports. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Slightly elevated risk scores reflect the dynamic import pattern but do not indicate actual security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for lazy importing of 'rich' components, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate, though the dynamic import pattern introduces minimal potential for exploitation if the environment is compromised. Overall, the code is safe under normal conditions.",
