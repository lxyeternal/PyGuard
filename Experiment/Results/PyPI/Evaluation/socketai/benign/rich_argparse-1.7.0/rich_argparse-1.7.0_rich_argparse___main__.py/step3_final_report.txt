  "purpose": "A CLI utility that enhances argparse help output with rich formatting and styling options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), user-supplied options influencing help display and styling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "User inputs affect argument parsing and help output formatting, with no malicious data flow or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (`argparse`, `sys`) and external modules (`rich`, `rich_argparse`) to create a command-line help formatter. It conditionally either prints help or parses arguments based on user input, with no network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The use of `HelpPreviewAction` with an external SVG file is documented and benign. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The argument options modify help styling but do not execute untrusted code or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured CLI help formatter leveraging known libraries. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
