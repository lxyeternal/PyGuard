{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom help message formatter that processes text for display, including paragraph separation, whitespace normalization, and line wrapping.",
  "sources": "The input 'text' parameter passed to _rich_split_lines and _rich_fill_text functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs in-memory string manipulations only, with no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input text -> whitespace normalization -> paragraph splitting -> line wrapping -> formatted text output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code operates solely on string data for formatting purposes, utilizing functions from the 'rich' library. It does not process untrusted input beyond standard string handling, nor does it perform network, file, or command execution. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. All external functions used are standard for text formatting and are assumed safe. The code's purpose is purely presentational, and it maintains a clear, readable structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a help message formatter that manipulates text for display. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the code's behavior.",
