{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom help message formatter for the rich_argparse library, specifically for formatting help messages with paragraph separation and proper wrapping.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'text' parameter in '_rich_split_lines' and '_rich_fill_text' methods, and from the 'console' attribute used in 'rich_wrap'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'rich_wrap', which processes text for display, and string concatenation for output formatting. No untrusted input handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through '_rich_split_lines' where it is split, whitespace normalized, wrapped, and then combined with indentation in '_rich_fill_text'. The 'console' object influences wrapping but is assumed to be safe as part of the library's context.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs standard text formatting using external library functions without evident obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom help message formatter for rich_argparse, involving text splitting, whitespace normalization, wrapping, and formatting with indentation. It relies on the rich library for text processing and display. No input validation or network operations are involved. The functions operate solely on provided text data and internal formatting routines, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a help message formatter with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard text formatting tasks and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic.",
