{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom help message formatter for the rich_argparse library, which enhances the display of help messages with paragraph retention and proper wrapping.",
  "sources": "Input text for formatting functions (_rich_split_lines and _rich_fill_text), specifically the 'text' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, network, or files. It primarily processes text for display purposes.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows through _rich_split_lines, which processes and wraps it for display; then _rich_fill_text combines this with indentation for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. Usage of external rich library functions appears standard. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides text formatting functionalities, splitting paragraphs, normalizing whitespace, wrapping lines, and concatenating with indentation. It relies on external 'rich' library components, which are typical for enhanced CLI output. No external input handling or network operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The functions are straightforward, focusing on text processing for help messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured text formatting utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses the 'rich' library for display enhancements without any suspicious behavior.",
