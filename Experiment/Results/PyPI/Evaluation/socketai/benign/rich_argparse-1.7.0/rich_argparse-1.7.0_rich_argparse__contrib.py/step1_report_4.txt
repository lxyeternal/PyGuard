  "purpose": "Custom help message formatter for rich text display in command-line interfaces, enhancing readability by maintaining paragraph separation and proper wrapping.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly 'rich_argparse._lazy_rich' and other internal functions from 'rich_argparse._common'. No external input or untrusted data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "Function calls like 'rich_wrap', 'rich_strip', and string manipulations; no data sinks such as network, file, or system commands observed.",
  "flows": "Text data flows through '_rich_split_lines' and '_rich_fill_text', but only within formatting functions; no untrusted source flows to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code performs standard formatting operations without dynamic code execution or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom formatter class inheriting from 'RichHelpFormatter'. It processes text to split into paragraphs, normalize whitespace, wrap lines, and maintain paragraph separation. All functions operate solely on passed text objects and internal formatting functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign implementation of a help message formatter designed for improved CLI readability. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
