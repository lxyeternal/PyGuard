  "purpose": "Re-export module providing argument parsing and help formatting classes/functions from 'rich_argparse._argparse'.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'rich_argparse._argparse'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; purely static import/export.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static symbol re-export.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export statements with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes/functions from a third-party or internal module and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no data handling, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified given the static, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static re-export module with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
