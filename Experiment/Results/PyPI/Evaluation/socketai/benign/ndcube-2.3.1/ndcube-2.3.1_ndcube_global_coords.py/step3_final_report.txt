  "purpose": "Coordinate management and conversion within astronomical data, involving deserialization of coordinate classes during internal processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for methods like 'add', 'remove', and during '_convert_dropped_to_internal' deserialization of class objects.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization process that could execute code if input data is malicious; no other external sinks present.",
  "flows": "From external serialized class data into deserialization functions, then into coordinate objects stored internally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'deserialize_class' during coordinate conversion; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns otherwise.",
  "analysis": "The code manages coordinate data with standard deserialization via 'deserialize_class'. While this introduces a potential vector if input data is untrusted, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The deserialization step is a known security concern but is common in scientific processing where input data is controlled. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is present. The risk score is elevated (0.3) due to the deserialization vector, which could be exploited if malicious serialized data is supplied. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the code context and absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate coordinate management implementation with a known deserialization risk. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, risk=0.3) are appropriate considering the potential for exploitation through deserialization if inputs are untrusted.",
