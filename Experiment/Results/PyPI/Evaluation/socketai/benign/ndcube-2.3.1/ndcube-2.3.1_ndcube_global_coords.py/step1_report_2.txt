{
  "purpose": "This code defines abstract and concrete classes for managing global coordinate information associated with an NDCube object, including methods for adding, removing, filtering, and accessing coordinates, with support for deserialization and conversion from WCS-style dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads coordinate data from method parameters such as 'coord' in 'add', from class attributes like '_internal_coords' and '_ndcube', and from external modules like 'deserialize_class' and 'validate_physical_types'. No direct untrusted input sources such as user input or network data are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a potentially unsafe way, such as executing commands, writing files, or network communication. External functions like 'deserialize_class' are used for class deserialization, but they are imported from trusted libraries and used in controlled context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters ('add' method) into internal storage ('_internal_coords'), from external deserialization ('deserialize_class') during coordinate conversion, and from internal storage when accessing coordinate objects or filtering by physical type.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The use of 'deserialize_class' could potentially be risky if the input data is untrusted, but it is imported from a standard library, and the context suggests controlled deserialization. No code injection or obfuscation patterns are present. The code appears to be standard structured data handling and transformation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured with clear separation of responsibilities. It manages coordinate data for a cube object, supports deserialization of coordinate classes from stored dictionaries, and ensures physical types are validated. It does not perform network operations, file writing, or execute arbitrary code based on external inputs. External library calls are controlled and expected in this context. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate, domain-specific implementation with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of coordinate management within a scientific data context. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. No security risks or malware signals are detected. Its operations rely on trusted libraries and controlled data structures.",
