  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as an auto-generated, static version declaration for a Python package.\n- The code contains no input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is consistent with standard practices for version info in Python packages, especially those generated by setuptools_scm.\n- The reported malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code's purpose is purely to define version variables, with no external data handling.\n- The conditional import for typing is a common pattern and does not introduce any security concerns.\n- The comments explicitly mention that the code is auto-generated and should not be modified, further indicating its benign purpose.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is justified. The reports' score of 0.0 is reasonable.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- There are no errors, flaws, or suspicious claims in the reports.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a harmless, auto-generated version declaration snippet.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No malicious or security risks are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
