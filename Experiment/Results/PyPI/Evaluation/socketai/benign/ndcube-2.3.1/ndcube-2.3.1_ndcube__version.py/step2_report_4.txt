  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, the reasoning provided, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version declaration for a Python package, created by setuptools_scm.\n- It contains no dynamic logic, no external input handling, no network operations, and no obfuscation.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code matches the description: static assignment of version info, with conditional type checking imports. No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n\n- **Errors or mistakes?**  \n  **None.** All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Correct, since the code only declares version info.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0` or `0.5`. Given the nature of the code, `0` is appropriate; there's no security concern.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. They are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n\n- **Higher risk or malware scores?**  \n  Not justified here. The code is standard, auto-generated, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports avoid assumptions and correctly identify that no vulnerabilities exist.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores with the report:\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, auto-generated version declaration with no dynamic behavior, no external data, and no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
