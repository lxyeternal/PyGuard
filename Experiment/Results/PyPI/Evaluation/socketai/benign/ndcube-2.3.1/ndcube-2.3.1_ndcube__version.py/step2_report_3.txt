  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is an auto-generated version info snippet created by setuptools_scm.\n- It defines version variables (__version__, __version_tuple__, version, version_tuple) with static values.\n- It includes a type-checking block that imports typing annotations only during static analysis.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or external data processing.\n- The code comments explicitly state it is auto-generated and should not be modified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n  **Yes, the issues reported are accurate; the code is benign.**\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple version declaration with no security concerns. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0  \n  These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code is purely static and auto-generated with no malicious activity, malware score 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports base their conclusions on static analysis, standard practices, and the absence of suspicious patterns. No unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is a typical auto-generated version info file, with no dynamic or malicious components.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No modifications or updates needed for the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's benign, static, and auto-generated nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a harmless, auto-generated version declaration snippet with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
