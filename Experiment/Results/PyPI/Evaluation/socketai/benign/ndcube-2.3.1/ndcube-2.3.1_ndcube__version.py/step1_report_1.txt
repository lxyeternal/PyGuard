{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, with no operational behavior beyond version assignment.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and tuple; no input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string and tuple variables; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version information setup with comments indicating auto-generation and no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, including a string and a tuple, based on auto-generated content from setuptools_scm. It includes a type checking block that imports typing annotations for development purposes but does not execute at runtime. There are no external inputs, user data processing, or external outputs. The code contains no suspicious logic, obfuscated patterns, or malicious constructs. It appears to serve as a version metadata placeholder, which is common in Python packaging.\n\nThe comments explicitly state it is auto-generated and should not be modified or tracked in version control, further indicating its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless auto-generated version info script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns.",
