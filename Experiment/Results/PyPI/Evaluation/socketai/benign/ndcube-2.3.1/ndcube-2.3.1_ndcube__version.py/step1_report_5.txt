{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and does not perform any runtime logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the version tuple '__version_tuple__', which are assigned static values.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not handle input, output, or external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static, hardcoded values to version variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is generated and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation or hidden behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of version information using static values. It includes type hints and conditional imports for type checking, which are standard practices. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The structure is simple and consistent with auto-generated version info files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves only to store version info, and poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
