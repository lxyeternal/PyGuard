{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, used for version management.",
  "sources": "Reads version string '2.3.1' assigned to __version__ and version variables; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; static assignment of version info only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard for version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing modules only during type checking, which is standard practice. It assigns static version info to variables, with no dynamic input, external communication, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version definition snippet generated by setuptools_scm, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
