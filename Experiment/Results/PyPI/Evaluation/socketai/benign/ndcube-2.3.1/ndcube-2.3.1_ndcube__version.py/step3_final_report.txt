  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated version declaration snippet with static values and conditional type checking imports. It contains no dynamic behavior, external input, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and comments confirm its purpose as a benign version info file. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present, and the code aligns with best practices for such auto-generated files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, static, auto-generated version information with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
