  "purpose": "Define and assign version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, no input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets beyond version info, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines version variables, some conditional typing support, and assigns static version info. There are no input sources, no external data processing, no security-sensitive operations. The code appears standard for version declaration in Python packages, generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic or obscure constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet with no malicious or security risks identified.",
