  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version declaration snippet for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples, with conditional imports for type checking.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, outputs, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The comments explicitly state it is auto-generated and should not be modified, indicating benign intent.\n\n**Review of individual reports:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - Purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies all point to benign, straightforward version info code.\n   - **Score justification:** Malware score = 0, security risk = 0, as no malicious behavior is observed.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid and accurate.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - Similar observations; standard version declaration with no external data or suspicious logic.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - Same pattern; static assignment, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - Consistent with previous; straightforward version info code.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Also standard, static version info code.\n   - **Scores:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.\n   - **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, auto-generated version info.\n- No anomalies, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly at 0.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**In conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security concerns.",
