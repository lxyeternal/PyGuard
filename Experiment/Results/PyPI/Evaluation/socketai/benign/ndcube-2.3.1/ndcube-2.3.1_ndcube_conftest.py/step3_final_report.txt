{
  "purpose": "The code provides fixtures and helper functions for setting up test cases for the NDCube library, including creation of WCS headers, coordinate objects, and data cubes with various configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from static functions generating numpy arrays, Time objects, and coordinate lookup tables; no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data externally, write to files, or execute commands; it solely creates in-memory objects for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "There are no external data flows; data flows are confined within the creation of numpy arrays, coordinate objects, and cube instances for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of static fixture functions that generate test data, WCS headers, coordinate objects, and NDCube instances using standard scientific libraries. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The use of 'matplotlib.use('Agg')' is a standard testing practice. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely for setting up controlled test environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and designed solely for testing the NDCube library. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
