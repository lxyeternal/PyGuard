{
  "purpose": "The code provides fixtures and helper functions for testing the NDCube library, mainly creating various WCS, ExtraCoords, and NDCube objects for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (logging, numpy, pytest, astropy, ndcube), and fixtures/functions that generate data, WCS headers, and coordinate objects.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted or external input in a security-sensitive manner. No data transmission, file writing, or external commands are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily generates static test data and configuration objects without external data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious code patterns or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of fixture functions for testing, which create data arrays, coordinate objects, WCS headers, and NDCube instances. These are static data structures meant for testing purposes, with no external input processing or network communication. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The code carefully constructs test data with no malicious logic. Usage of import statements is standard, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation is detected. The code includes a cleanup function for plots, which is unrelated to security threats.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be legitimate test setup code for the NDCube package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of test fixtures for the NDCube package, generating static test data and configurations. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
