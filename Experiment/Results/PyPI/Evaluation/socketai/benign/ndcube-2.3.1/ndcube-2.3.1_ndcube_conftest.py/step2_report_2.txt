  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is test fixture setup code for the NDCube library, creating static data structures, WCS headers, coordinate objects, and cube instances.\n- **Findings:** No external data processing, no network communication, no dynamic code execution, no secrets or obfuscation. The code is purely for testing purposes.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Negligible.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears safe, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on fixture definitions for testing, with standard external libraries.\n- **Findings:** No external untrusted data processing, no network activity, no obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Fixture code for setting up test data and configurations, with standard scientific libraries.\n- **Findings:** No external data leaks, no network, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, purely for testing.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Fixtures for various cube configurations, WCS, and coordinate setups.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no external data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Fixtures for setting up test data and WCS configurations.\n- **Findings:** No external communication, no obfuscation, no secrets, no malicious code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, and the code contains no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Given that all code is for test fixture setup—creating static data, configuration objects, and helper functions—there is no indication of security vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or external data leaks.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n**Note:** The code is purely for testing purposes, with no external data processing or network communication, and no obfuscation or secrets involved.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and designed solely for testing the NDCube library. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores.",
