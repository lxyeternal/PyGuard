{
  "purpose": "The code defines fixtures and helper functions for testing the NDCube library, mainly setting up WCS, coordinate, and cube objects for unit tests.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (numpy, astropy, pytest, dask, matplotlib), file reading via imports, and fixture functions providing data and objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found; no untrusted data processing or data output to external systems or network observed.",
  "flows": "Fixture functions generate objects with preset data, no flow of untrusted input to critical points; data flow is internal and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or unusual code patterns. Use of external libraries appears standard for scientific computing. No hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of test fixtures for the NDCube package, including WCS headers, coordinate tables, and cube objects. No network operations, system modifications, or sensitive data handling are present. The code relies on well-known libraries and standard patterns for scientific data setup. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious logic found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup for scientific cube data structures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code snippet. It is safe and solely intended for test data preparation.",
