{
  "purpose": "The code sets up fixtures for testing the NDCube library, providing sample data, WCS configurations, and auxiliary coordinate setups for unit tests.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from fixtures (e.g., shape, coordinate tables, mock data arrays), and external libraries (e.g., numpy, astropy, dask, matplotlib).",
  "sinks": "Uses data to instantiate NDCube objects and related classes; no external untrusted sink or data leak mechanisms detected.",
  "flows": "Fixtures generate data, WCS, and coordinate objects; these are used to create NDCube instances, which do not perform external or malicious actions during their creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hidden network connections, or code injection patterns. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. Usage of standard scientific libraries and fixtures is typical for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data fixtures for testing purposes, including various configurations of WCS, coordinate systems, and NDCube objects. It employs standard Python practices and external scientific libraries. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unexpected dynamic execution is present. The code is well-structured for testing without side-effects or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup for testing the NDCube library with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It purely creates sample objects and data for unit testing. The likelihood of malware or malicious behavior is extremely low.",
