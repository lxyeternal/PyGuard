  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for package setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical minimal setup script that imports setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments. It contains no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The simplicity indicates a straightforward package setup without embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs no suspicious actions beyond typical package configuration.",
