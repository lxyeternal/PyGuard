  "sinks": "Potentially writes or reads package metadata during installation, but no explicit data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; the setup() call initializes package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and executes setup(), which is typical for Python packaging scripts. No input reading, no data leakage, and no malicious commands are present. The code is very simple and follows common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard package setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical setup script for Python packages.",
