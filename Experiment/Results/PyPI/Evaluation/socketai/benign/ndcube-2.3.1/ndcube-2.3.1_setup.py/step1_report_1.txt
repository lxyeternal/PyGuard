  "purpose": "The script is used to configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No specific data input sources; it relies on package configuration files if any.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup() call initializes package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and typical for Python packaging; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls setup() with default parameters. There are no additional parameters, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. This is standard boilerplate for a Python package's setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
