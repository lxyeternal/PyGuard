  "purpose": "The code defines classes and helper functions for managing, slicing, and plotting sequences of ndcube.NDCube objects, facilitating multidimensional data handling and visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from list inputs (data_list), attributes like meta, common_axis, and from properties accessing cube data, shape, and coordinate information. It also reads attributes of individual cubes such as data.shape, meta, global_coords, axis_world_coords, combined_wcs, and plotting configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that slice or manipulate data (e.g., __getitem__, crop, explode_along_axis), which could lead to unexpected data exposure if malicious data is injected, but these are controlled via slicing and data access patterns. There are no explicit network operations, file writes, or code execution points. WCS attribute access might be exploited if WCS objects are maliciously crafted, but this is standard WCS attribute access.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data could flow through data list inputs, coordinate calculations, and slicing operations. For example, slicing via __getitem__ or crop methods could potentially access unintended data if the data_list is maliciously constructed, but the code itself primarily manipulates in-memory data. The only flow involving external objects is through WCS attributes and coordinate computations, which are standard and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code does utilize some deprecated warnings, but these are benign. No malicious code snippets such as data exfiltration, network calls, or code execution are detected. Usage of the 'warn_deprecated' function suggests planned deprecation but not malicious intent. The use of `PlotterDescriptor` is a standard design pattern for delayed import and is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically manages sequences of cube-like objects, providing slicing, cropping, and coordinate aggregation functionalities. It makes use of standard Python and numpy features, and relies on existing object attributes (e.g., data, shape, WCS) for its operations. There are no indications of code injection, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling mechanisms. The data access patterns are safe, primarily involving attribute reads and controlled slicing. There are no external network operations, file writes, or code execution points. The deprecated warnings are benign. The design appears to be for data management and visualization, with no malicious components evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured implementation for handling sequences of multidimensional data cubes with no signs of malicious behavior. It primarily reads and manipulates data and coordinate attributes, with no external network or file interactions. The presence of deprecation warnings and standard Python patterns do not indicate malicious intent or security issues.",
