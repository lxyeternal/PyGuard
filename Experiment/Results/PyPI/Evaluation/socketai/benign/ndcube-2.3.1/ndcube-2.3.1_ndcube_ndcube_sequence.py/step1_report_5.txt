  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for managing and manipulating sequences of ndcube.NDCube objects, including slicing, cropping, and plotting functionalities.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'data_list' parameter during class initialization, and WCS objects or metadata may be read during cropping and slicing methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows could involve passing user-supplied points or WCS objects to cropping methods, which could lead to malicious data influencing the slicing operations.",
  "flows": "Input points or WCS objects (sources) are passed to cropping methods, which then generate slices used to index into cubes (sinks). This flow depends on external inputs but appears to be controlled through provided method parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code uses standard Python features and common scientific libraries without any suspicious dynamic code execution or unusual constructs. The only dynamic behavior involves slicing and data manipulation based on external inputs, which is typical for such libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages collections of ndcube.NDCube objects, providing properties for shape, dimensions, and coordinate transformations, along with methods for slicing, cropping, and plotting. It employs typical object-oriented design, with properties and helper classes. The only notable dynamic behavior involves handling user input for cropping and slicing, which is implemented via methods that take user-supplied points or WCS objects. These inputs are passed directly to the crop methods of individual cubes without additional sanitization or validation, which could potentially be exploited if malicious data is provided. However, since this is a scientific data handling library, such behavior is standard. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing and manipulating sequences of ndcube.NDCube objects, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles user inputs for cropping and slicing in a typical manner for scientific libraries. While external inputs are used in cropping functions, this is expected behavior, and there are no signs of malicious data leaks or sabotage within this code segment.",
