{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for handling sequences of ndcube.NDCube objects, providing methods for slicing, cropping, plotting, and coordinate transformations within a cube sequence.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from cube objects (`self.data`), cube attributes (`cube.combined_wcs`, `cube.global_coords`, `cube.axis_world_coords`), and external libraries (`numpy`, `astropy.units`). It also reads method parameters such as points, wcses, and cropping options.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include slicing operations (`__getitem__`, `explode_along_axis`, `crop`, `crop_by_values`) which could handle untrusted input; coordinate-related methods (`common_axis_coords`, `sequence_axis_coords`) which process coordinate data; and plotting functions that could potentially handle untrusted plotting commands.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input data (such as points or slicing parameters) flow into cropping and slicing methods, which then access or modify cube data and coordinate information. These flows could lead to unintended data access if input is maliciously crafted, but there is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Use of `copy.deepcopy`, dynamic slicing, and coordinate transformations appear standard for scientific data processing. No obfuscated code, such as encrypted strings or complex eval/exec patterns, is present. Warnings about deprecated properties are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements sequence handling for data cubes, with careful handling of slicing, coordinate transformations, and axis management. It uses standard Python idioms and external scientific libraries. No suspicious external network calls, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. Slicing and cropping methods appear to process input parameters in a typical, transparent manner. The presence of plotting functions and coordinate handling could be misused if user inputs are untrusted, but this does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to serve its purpose of data management without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific data management module for cube sequences with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It handles input data, coordinate transformations, slicing, and visualization in a typical manner for scientific computing. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this module.",
