{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to determine the version number of a Python package, either by importing a development version string from a local module or falling back to a default version.",
  "sources": "Reading from local modules '_dev.scm_version' and '_version' to obtain the version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Import attempts from '_dev.scm_version' or '_version' modules, with exception handling and warning issuance.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual handling of import errors with fallback and warnings, but nothing suspicious or malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version string from a potentially development-specific module, using nested try-except blocks to handle ImportError. If both imports fail, it issues a warning about a broken installation and sets a default version. The approach is standard for version management in Python packages and does not involve any suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version detection pattern for Python packages, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It handles errors gracefully and provides fallback behavior. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present.",
