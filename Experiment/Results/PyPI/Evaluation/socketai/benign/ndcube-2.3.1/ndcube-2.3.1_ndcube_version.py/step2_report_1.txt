  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which is a standard pattern for version detection in Python packages.\n- The code attempts to import version info from optional modules, with a fallback to a default version string and issuing warnings if necessary.\n- No untrusted input data, external network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The error handling, while broad, is typical for such use cases.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a common pattern for version detection.  \n  **Verdict:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The nested try-except blocks are somewhat broad, catching all exceptions, which might mask unexpected errors. However, this is standard for such version detection code and not necessarily a flaw.  \n- The code relies on local modules; if these modules are compromised, that could be a concern, but based on the code snippet alone, no such issue is evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** No significant flaws or mistakes are apparent in the code logic.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Overall risk score:**  \n  Given the above, a score of 0.0 or very close to it is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- None of the reports justify a risk score higher than 0.5.  \n- The code is standard, with no malicious intent, no external data processing, and no security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The logic and reasoning are sound and align with standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code snippet is a typical version detection pattern used in Python packaging, with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected, and the scoring should reflect that.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Note:** No adjustments are necessary; the current scores are appropriate.",
