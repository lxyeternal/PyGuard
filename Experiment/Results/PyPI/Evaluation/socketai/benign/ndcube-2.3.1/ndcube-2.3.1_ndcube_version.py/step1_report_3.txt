  "purpose": "Attempt to determine the package version by importing version information from local modules or fallback to a default value.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ._dev.scm_version and ._version modules, and fallback to setting version='0.0.0'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to the 'version' variable, which may influence version-dependent behavior.",
  "flows": "Import attempts from local modules -> fallback to default version string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses nested try-except blocks for import handling and a fallback warning and default value. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to import version info from local modules, with fallback handling if imports fail, issuing a warning. The structure is straightforward, focusing on version retrieval. No external data input or untrusted data flows are present. The warning indicates potential installation issues but not malicious intent. The code does not include any network activity, file manipulation, or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version detection pattern with fallback handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical part of package setup scripts, with no indication of malware or suspicious activity.",
