  "purpose": "Determine the package version by importing from optional modules, with fallback and warning if version cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules: ._dev.scm_version and ._version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Import attempts flow from _dev.scm_version to _version; if errors occur, a warning is issued and a default version is set.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard version retrieval logic with error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import version information from a development-specific module, then falls back to a static version module if import fails. If all attempts fail, it issues a warning and assigns a default version string. The exception handling is broad but standard for such versioning logic. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident, such as data exfiltration or code injection. The imports are from local modules, which are typical for version management, and there are no external network calls or environment variable usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version import fallback mechanism with proper error handling. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
