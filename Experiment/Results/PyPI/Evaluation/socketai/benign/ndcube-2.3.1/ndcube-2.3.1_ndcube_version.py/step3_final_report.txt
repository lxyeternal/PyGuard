  "purpose": "Attempt to import version information from optional modules for package versioning, with fallback to a default version string and warning if necessary.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._dev.scm_version and ._version modules, and the exception handling block that triggers warnings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; only warnings issued within the local environment.",
  "flows": "Try importing version from ._dev.scm_version; if fails with ImportError, try ._version; if any other exception occurs, issue warning and set version='0.0.0'.",
  "anomalies": "Nested try-except blocks broadly catching all exceptions; no malicious or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard version detection pattern with fallback and warning mechanisms. No external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Error handling is broad but typical for such use cases. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe version detection snippet with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall risk.",
