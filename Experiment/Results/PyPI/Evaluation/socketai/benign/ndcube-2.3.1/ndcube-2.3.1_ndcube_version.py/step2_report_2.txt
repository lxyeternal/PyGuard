  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Attempts to import `version` from `._dev.scm_version`.\n- If that fails with `ImportError`, attempts to import from `._version`.\n- If any other exception occurs, issues a warning indicating a broken installation and sets `version = '0.0.0'`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- The import logic is standard for version detection in Python packages.\n- Error handling is broad but typical for this context.\n- No external input is processed; no data leaks or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The fallback to `'0.0.0'` is a common practice when version info cannot be retrieved.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent in stating that the code is standard and benign.\n- They correctly identify that no suspicious behavior, malicious intent, or obfuscation is present.\n- The reports sometimes mention \"unusual\" error handling, but this is typical for such version detection snippets.\n- No report claims any actual vulnerability or malicious activity; all are accurate.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0`\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence score of 1 across reports is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The broad exception handling could, in theory, mask issues, but in this context, it is a standard pattern and not malicious.\n- The warning about a broken installation is benign and typical in version detection code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is a standard, safe version detection snippet with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis matches the current assessments and reflects the code's harmless nature.",
