  "purpose": "Determine the package version by attempting to import version information from local modules or fallback to a default version.",
  "sources": "Attempted imports from ._dev.scm_version and ._version modules, and the fallback to setting version to '0.0.0'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not handle untrusted input data directly; no data leaks or security effects are evident.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data flows identified; the code only imports modules and assigns a default version if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs nested try-except blocks to handle import errors silently, which is normal for version detection but not suspicious in itself. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import version information from a development-specific module, falling back to a static version if necessary, with warning alerts if version detection fails. The structure is standard for version handling. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are evident. No external data is processed, and no security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version detection snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It handles errors gracefully and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
