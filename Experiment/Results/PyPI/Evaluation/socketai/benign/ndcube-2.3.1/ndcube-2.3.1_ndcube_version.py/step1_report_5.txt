  "purpose": "Attempt to determine the package version by importing from either _dev.scm_version or _version, with fallback and warning if unsuccessful.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ._dev.scm_version and ._version; use of __name__ for warning message",
  "sinks": "Assigning to the variable 'version', issuing a warning via warnings.warn",
  "flows": "Import attempts → fallback to default version '0.0.0' with warning",
  "anomalies": "Use of nested try-except to handle import errors; dynamic import paths based on package structure; no suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code first tries to import 'version' from a potential development module '_dev.scm_version'. If that fails with ImportError, it falls back to importing 'version' from '_version'. If any other exception occurs, it issues a warning that version detection failed and sets 'version' to '0.0.0'. The logic is straightforward, focusing on robust version retrieval with fallback. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity detected. The code’s structure and comments indicate standard version management practices in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version import fallback mechanism with no malicious behavior or security issues. It gracefully handles missing modules and warns the user, typical for package version handling. No signs of malware or supply chain attack detected.",
