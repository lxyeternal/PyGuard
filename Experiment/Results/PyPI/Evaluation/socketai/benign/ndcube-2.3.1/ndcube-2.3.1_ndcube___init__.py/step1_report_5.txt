{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports components of the 'ndcube' package, including classes, metadata, and version info, for managing multi-dimensional coordinate-aware arrays.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and attributes from local package files: '.extra_coords.extra_coords', '.global_coords', '.meta', '.ndcollection', '.ndcube', '.ndcube_sequence', and '.version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks, system modifications, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and exposes components without processing external data or executing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code strictly performs imports and defines an '__all__' list for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific classes and variables from local package modules and then defines the '__all__' list for public API exposure. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of external input, and no suspicious operations. It appears to be a standard package setup script with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package __init__.py file that imports and exposes components for the 'ndcube' library. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. The code appears safe and intentional, primarily serving as an API surface definition.",
