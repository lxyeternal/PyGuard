{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface and imports for the 'ndcube' package, a library for multi-dimensional coordinate-aware arrays.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module files within the package (extra_coords, global_coords, meta, ndcollection, etc.). No external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform critical operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and defines __all__ for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and variables from local modules, then defines the __all__ list for public API exposure. No data processing, user input, or system commands are involved. The structure and syntax are standard and clear, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package __init__.py file setting up module exports with no indications of malicious or security-compromising behavior. It appears safe and benign.",
