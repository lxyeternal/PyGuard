  "purpose": "This code defines and exports classes and variables for the 'ndcube' package, providing multi-dimensional coordinate-aware arrays.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules within the package, and the assignment of the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None; no handling of untrusted input, network operations, or data output.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code primarily performs static imports and exports without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments present. No unusual behaviors or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization file (__init__.py), importing classes and defining __all__ for module exports. It contains no user input handling, no external network operations, and no runtime code execution beyond static imports. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
