  "purpose": "This code initializes the 'ndcube' package by importing core classes and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules; no external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static imports and exports only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package initialization with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing classes and variables from internal modules and defining __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign and straightforward nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, transparent structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action or code modification is necessary.",
