{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package for coordinate-aware array data structures related to the ndcube library, primarily establishing imports and exports for package components.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from imported modules: extra_coords.extra_coords, global_coords, meta, ndcollection, ndcube, ndcube_sequence, version.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or write to external systems.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing various classes and attributes from internal modules, setting __all__ for exports, with no external data input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with standard imports and module metadata definitions. No hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes and constants from internal modules to structure a Python package. It sets the __all__ variable to define public API components. No user input handling, data processing, or system interactions are present. The code appears to be a typical package __init__.py file, intended for organizing namespace exports. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It primarily manages imports and exports for the ndcube library modules. No suspicious or harmful activity is detected.",
