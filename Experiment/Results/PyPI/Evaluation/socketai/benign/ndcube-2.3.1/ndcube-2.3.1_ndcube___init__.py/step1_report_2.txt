{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package module for the 'ndcube' library, importing various classes and variables for multi-dimensional coordinate-aware arrays.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input or data; the code only performs import statements and defines the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely imports modules and defines public API exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and variables from relative modules within the package, and then defines the __all__ list for public API exposure. It contains only standard Python import and variable assignment statements, with no external data handling, user input processing, or potentially dangerous code. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py or module entry point. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file manipulation, or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package module initialization script, importing and exporting classes for the 'ndcube' library. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
