  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"0.26.9\"`).\n   - There are no indications of input/output handling, data flows, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that this is a benign, typical version declaration with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports correctly identify no malicious activity, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code is a straightforward version string assignment; no malicious behavior is indicated.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as standard practice.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - All assessments correctly reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is a typical, benign version declaration with no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is only a version string assignment, there is no reason to assign any higher scores. The current scores are appropriate.",
