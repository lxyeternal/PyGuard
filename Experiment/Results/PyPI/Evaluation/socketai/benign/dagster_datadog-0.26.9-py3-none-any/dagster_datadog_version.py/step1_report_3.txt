  "purpose": "The code appears to specify the version of a software package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable, which could be used by other parts of the program or package for version tracking.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string for a Python package/module, a common practice for package versioning. It contains only a simple string assignment with no other logic or data handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no external inputs, or suspicious operations. Since this is a single line, the security risk is minimal, and there is no evidence of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version assignment statement with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It serves to specify the package version and is typical in Python packages.",
