  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of a version string assignment (`__version__ = \"0.26.9\"`).\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple version declaration with no security concerns.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that the code is just a version string with no malicious activity, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code.\n   - No challenges needed here.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, standard version string assignment in Python, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | 0            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            |\n| Security Risk      | 0            |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' findings and the code's simplicity.",
