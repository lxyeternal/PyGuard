  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data handling.\n   - The code is minimal and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n   - All reports are consistent and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is straightforward, this is justified.\n   - No higher scores are warranted here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior, so this is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code snippet is a standard version declaration with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with best practices and the analysis provided.",
