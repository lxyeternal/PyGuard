{
  "purpose": "The code provides a resource wrapper for the Datadog API, allowing integration with Dagster workflows for metrics and event reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'api_key' and 'app_key' from configuration inputs for initializing the Datadog client.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or send data to untrusted sources; it interfaces with Datadog's API using provided credentials.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from user input into the resource, which initializes the DatadogClient; the client can then send metrics or events to Datadog.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden functions are present. The use of 'initialize' with API keys is standard for such integrations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and wraps the Datadog API, exposing methods for metrics reporting and event logging. It securely receives API keys via configuration and uses them to initialize the client. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network access, or backdoors. No obfuscation or unusual constructs are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation for Datadog integration within a Dagster pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward resource wrapper for Datadog's API, intended for metrics and event reporting in Dagster. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. It adheres to standard practices for such integrations.",
