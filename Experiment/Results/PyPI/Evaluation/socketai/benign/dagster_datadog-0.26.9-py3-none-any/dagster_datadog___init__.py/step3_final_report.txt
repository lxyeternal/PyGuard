  "purpose": "Registering a Dagster library and exposing resources for Datadog integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Dagster and Datadog modules, version import, registration call, and resource exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> Register library -> Export resources via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward registration and resource export with no data handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. It uses standard patterns for plugin modules. No malicious or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0 or 0.1) are consistent with the analysis, though the minimal risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, with a minor recommendation to set the security risk score to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
