{
  "purpose": "The code registers a library and exports specific resources and version information, likely for use in a larger Dagster data pipeline framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_datadog.resources', and 'dagster_datadog.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imported modules and objects are registered or exported; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs library registration and exports of resources. It imports standard library modules related to Dagster and Datadog integrations. The register function is called with a package name and version, which is typical for plugin or library registration. The export of resources via __all__ is standard practice. No network connections, data handling, or potentially malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be part of a structured plugin system and contains no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, serving as a registration and export module within a data pipeline framework. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
