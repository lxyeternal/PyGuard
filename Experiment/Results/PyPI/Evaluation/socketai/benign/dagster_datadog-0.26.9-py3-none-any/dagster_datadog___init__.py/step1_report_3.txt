{
  "purpose": "This code is used to register a library and expose certain resources and functions related to Dagster and Datadog integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and functions, and the registration call to DagsterLibraryRegistry.register",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not handle untrusted input or perform output that could leak data",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; primarily module registration and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. Import and registration appear standard for a Python module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules related to Dagster and Datadog, registers a library with a version, and defines exported resources. The structure is typical for a Python package setup. No indications of malicious activity, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup for Dagster and Datadog integration, with no malicious behavior detected. It functions to register a library and expose certain resources, without any suspicious or malicious code present.",
