{
  "purpose": "The code registers a library and exports resources related to Datadog integration, likely for monitoring purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_datadog.resources', and 'dagster_datadog.version' modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imports are used to register and expose components; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for plugin/resource registration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs library registration with a version number and exposes certain resources. It imports modules, registers a library, and defines __all__ for exports. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code’s structure is typical for a module that registers resources and does not contain any dynamic execution or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, focusing on registering and exporting resources for a monitoring library. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
