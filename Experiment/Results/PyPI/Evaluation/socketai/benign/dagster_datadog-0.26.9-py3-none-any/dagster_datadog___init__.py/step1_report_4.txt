{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily responsible for registering a library and exposing certain resources related to Dagster and Datadog integrations.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and attributes from 'dagster_shared', 'dagster_datadog.resources', and 'dagster_datadog.version'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted input; the code only registers a library and defines exports.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code only performs registration and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed. The registration appears straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and functions, then registers a library 'dagster-datadog' with a version number, and finally defines what symbols to export. The operations are standard library registration and module export. There are no inputs processed, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be to facilitate integration with Dagster and Datadog without any embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup for library registration and resource export. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
