{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to import and register modules related to Dagster and Datadog, exposing certain resources for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dagster_shared.libraries', 'dagster_datadog.resources', and 'dagster_datadog.version'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no code execution, data leakage, or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Imports and registration functions flow into module exports, with no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward module import and registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and functions related to Dagster and Datadog. It registers a library with a version number, which is typical for plugin or extension modules. The '__all__' list exposes selected resources. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or system compromise mechanisms. The code appears to be standard, well-structured module setup for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module registration and resource export script with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It performs straightforward imports, registration, and export of resources without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
