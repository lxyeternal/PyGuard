  "purpose": "Setup function to load the 'domain' module if available, as part of a larger application setup process.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'domain' module within a try block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data output points present.",
  "flows": "Attempted import of 'domain' module, followed by calling 'domain.setup(app)' if successful.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup function that conditionally imports a 'domain' module. The import is wrapped in a try-except block to handle ImportError gracefully. If the module is available, it calls 'domain.setup(app)'. There are no user inputs, external network calls, or data leaks. The code is straightforward, minimal, and appears to serve a modular setup purpose. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, safe conditional import and setup invocation. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified.",
