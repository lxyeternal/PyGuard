  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which conditionally imports a local 'domain' module and calls its setup function if available.\n- The code pattern is standard for optional plugin or extension loading.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is presented.\n- The import is wrapped in a try-except block to handle missing modules gracefully.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are observed.\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code functions as intended, with no signs of issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The logic is sound, and the pattern is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct—there's no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Reports give very low scores (mostly 0.1), which is reasonable considering the code's benign pattern. The slight risk score likely accounts for the silent failure pattern, but it's minimal.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are identified, raising scores beyond 0.1-0.2 would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The pattern is a common, safe plugin-loading approach.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is cautious and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, standard plugin pattern, no real risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code and the absence of any suspicious activity.",
