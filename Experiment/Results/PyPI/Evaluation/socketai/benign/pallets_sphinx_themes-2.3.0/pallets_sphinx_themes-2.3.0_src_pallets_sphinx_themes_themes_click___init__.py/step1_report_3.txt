  "purpose": "Load a local module 'domain' and invoke its setup function if it exists.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import domain'.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'domain.setup(app)' if the import succeeds.",
  "flows": "Import 'domain' → call 'domain.setup(app)'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import which is generally normal, but the code includes a try-except block to handle import failure silently, which is common but can obscure malicious attempts. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a local module named 'domain'. If the import fails (module not found or other ImportError), it silently returns without further action. If successful, it calls 'domain.setup(app)'. The try-except block ensures the code does not raise an exception on missing module, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code's simplicity and structure are typical for plugin or extension loading, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard plugin initialization pattern that attempts to load a local module and invoke its setup. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks. It appears to be benign.",
