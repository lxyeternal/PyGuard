  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a static style class with an optional import; no malicious code or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes the absence of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are both 0, which is appropriate. Obfuscated is 0, as code is straightforward.  \n- **Justification:** The code does not perform any suspicious operations. The optional import is benign.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; static style class, optional import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The report mentions the potential concern about the 'domain' module possibly containing malicious code, but correctly notes that this is a common pattern for extensions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which aligns with the code.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity is evident; the conditional import is benign in context.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; static style class, optional import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues identified; the report emphasizes the benign nature.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the code.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores seem justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; static style class, optional import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No concerns raised; the analysis is consistent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, matching the code's behavior.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or activity.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; static style class, optional import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues identified; the analysis is accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which is correct.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.  \n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as the code is purely static configuration with no security implications.  \n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified based on the code analysis.  \n- No changes are necessary.  \n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code provided.",
