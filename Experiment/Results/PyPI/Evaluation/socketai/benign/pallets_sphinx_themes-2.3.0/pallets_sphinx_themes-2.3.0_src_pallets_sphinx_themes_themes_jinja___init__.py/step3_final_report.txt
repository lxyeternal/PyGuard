  "purpose": "Define a syntax highlighting style for Pygments with optional extension loading.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes defining styles; setup() function with conditional import of 'domain'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with optional extension import.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a conditional import of 'domain', which could be malicious if the module is compromised, but this is a common pattern for optional extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class defining a syntax highlighting style, with a setup() function that attempts to import a local 'domain' module within a try-except block. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The optional import pattern is standard for extensions and does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely aesthetic configuration, and it does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe. The optional import of 'domain' is a common pattern for extensions and does not indicate malicious behavior. No security risks, obfuscation, or malware are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
