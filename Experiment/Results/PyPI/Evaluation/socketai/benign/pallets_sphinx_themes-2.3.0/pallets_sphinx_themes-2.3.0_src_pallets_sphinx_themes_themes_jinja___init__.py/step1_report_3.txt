{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments, specifically for Jinja templates.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.token and pygments.style; the setup function importing a local domain module.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs related to untrusted data; the setup function attempts to import a module conditionally.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets style configurations and conditionally imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The try-except block in setup is standard for optional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a style class with static style mappings, which is typical for Pygments styles. The setup function conditionally imports a local module and calls its setup method if available, which is a common pattern for plugin-like extensions. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve purely aesthetic configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Pygments style with an optional setup for a domain module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
