{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments and set up a domain if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pygments and the setup function that conditionally imports 'domain'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines a style class and optional setup.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of 'domain' within setup function; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom style class 'JinjaStyle' with static style definitions for syntax tokens, which is standard for Pygments. The setup function attempts to import a module '.domain' and calls its setup if available, handling ImportError gracefully. No untrusted input, no data leakage, no malicious code, or obfuscated segments detected. The code is straightforward and uses typical Python idioms for optional imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for defining a syntax highlighting style and conditionally initializing a domain module if present. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
