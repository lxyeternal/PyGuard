  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is static, defining a style class with no dynamic or unsafe behavior.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The optional import is standard practice.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, the code is static and safe.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** The conditional import of 'domain' could theoretically be malicious if the module contains malware, but in isolation, this pattern is common for optional extensions. No evidence of malicious intent.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code remains a static style definition with a benign setup.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the optional import is standard.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar pattern as previous reports.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The optional import is a common extension pattern.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a straightforward style class with a conditional import.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data exfiltration.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no malicious activity, no security risk is evident. The only potential concern is the conditional import of 'domain', which could contain malicious code, but this is a common pattern for optional modules and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 across all reports.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippets are benign, static configuration files for syntax highlighting with an optional extension module. No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I concur with the current scoring. The code is straightforward, safe, and does not warrant higher risk or malware scores.",
