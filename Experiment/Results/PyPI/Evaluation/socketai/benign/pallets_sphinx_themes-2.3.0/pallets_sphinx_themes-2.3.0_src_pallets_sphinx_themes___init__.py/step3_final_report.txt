  "purpose": "Configuration and setup of Sphinx themes, URL handling, autodoc filtering, and version management for documentation builds.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., READTHEDOCS_CANONICAL_URL, READTHEDOCS_VERSION), filesystem (themes directory), package metadata.",
  "sinks": "URL construction, autodoc filtering, theme addition, JavaScript inclusion, URL modification in context.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence URL and version strings; functions modify build context based on safe, read-only data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration tasks for Sphinx, utilizing environment variables safely for URL and version info. It uses common libraries and patterns, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. The environment variables are used in string concatenation and URL building, which is typical in CI/CD contexts. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward, and the code is readable and maintainable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe configuration code for a Sphinx documentation project. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated components. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified by environment variable reliance but do not indicate any threat. All reports correctly assess the code as benign with appropriate scoring.",
