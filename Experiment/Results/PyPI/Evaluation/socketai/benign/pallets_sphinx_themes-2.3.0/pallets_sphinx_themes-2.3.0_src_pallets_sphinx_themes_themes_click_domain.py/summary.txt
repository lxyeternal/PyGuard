  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for testing and documentation, executing arbitrary code snippets and capturing output. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity is detected. The main security risk is the execution of untrusted code, which is acceptable within a controlled environment. The scores are consistent with this assessment."
