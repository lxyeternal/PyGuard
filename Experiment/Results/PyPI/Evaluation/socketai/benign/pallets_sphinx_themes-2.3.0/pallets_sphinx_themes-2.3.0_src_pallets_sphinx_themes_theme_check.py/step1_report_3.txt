{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for a Sphinx extension to determine if a specific theme is used and to conditionally execute functions based on that.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values from 'app.config' and data from 'app.builder' and theme directories.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that lead to data leaks, system commands, or external communications. No file writes, network calls, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking theme directories to set a configuration flag, and a decorator that conditionally executes functions based on this flag.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Usage of standard library features, such as 'wraps', and straightforward logic without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard configuration checks and conditional decorator creation for a Sphinx extension. It accesses theme directories and configuration flags without any suspicious operations. No hardcoded credentials, external network access, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's logic appears typical for a plugin or extension setup, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for a Sphinx extension, with no malicious activity, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks observed. It appears safe and benign.",
