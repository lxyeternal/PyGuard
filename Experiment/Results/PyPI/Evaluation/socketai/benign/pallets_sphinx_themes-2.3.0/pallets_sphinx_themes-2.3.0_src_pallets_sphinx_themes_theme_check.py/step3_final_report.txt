{
  "purpose": "Detects if the current Sphinx theme is a descendant of the 'pocoo' theme and provides a decorator to conditionally execute functions based on this check.",
  "sources": "Reads 'app.config.is_pallets_theme', 'app.builder.theme', and theme directories via HTMLThemeFactory.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks; only configuration attributes and filesystem directory checks are used.",
  "flows": "Reads theme information and configuration; the decorator conditionally executes functions based on theme status.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard theme detection and conditional function execution within a Sphinx extension context. It reads configuration flags and filesystem directories safely, with no external network activity, data leaks, or code execution. The logic is straightforward, and the code uses common APIs without obfuscation. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a utility for theme detection in Sphinx, and all signals indicate safety. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
