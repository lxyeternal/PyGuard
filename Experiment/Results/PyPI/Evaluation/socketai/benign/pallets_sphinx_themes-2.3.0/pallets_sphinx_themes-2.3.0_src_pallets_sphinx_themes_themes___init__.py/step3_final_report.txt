  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of dynamic code execution (`exec`, `eval`), obfuscated strings, environment variables, network and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file system access, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, untrusted data) flow into dynamic execution, network communication, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, encoded strings, lack of validation, missing or empty code sections.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical indicators of suspicious or malicious intent. The suspicion is supported by the use of `exec`/`eval` and obfuscated strings, suggesting an attempt to conceal behavior. The code's purpose is ambiguous but potentially related to data processing or network communication. No concrete malicious payloads are confirmed, but the techniques used warrant caution. Other reports show benign or absent code, with no suspicious activity detected. The scores assigned (malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.55) are consistent with the observed behaviors and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution in Report 1, warranting attention but not confirming malicious activity. The other reports are benign or lack sufficient content for concern. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no significant adjustments are necessary.",
