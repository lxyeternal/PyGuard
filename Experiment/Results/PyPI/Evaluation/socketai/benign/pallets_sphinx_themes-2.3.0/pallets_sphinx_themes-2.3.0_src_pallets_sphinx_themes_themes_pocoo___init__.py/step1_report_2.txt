  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Pygments tokens and Style class, class attribute definitions, and style dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code does not process or handle external data or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - static class definition; no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures. No dynamic execution or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes from Pygments to define token styles. It creates a subclass of Style with specific color and style settings mapped to token types. There are no inputs, outputs, or runtime operations, and no external data handling. The code strictly establishes styling rules without any dynamic or potentially malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static configuration for syntax highlighting styles with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain any suspicious code patterns.",
