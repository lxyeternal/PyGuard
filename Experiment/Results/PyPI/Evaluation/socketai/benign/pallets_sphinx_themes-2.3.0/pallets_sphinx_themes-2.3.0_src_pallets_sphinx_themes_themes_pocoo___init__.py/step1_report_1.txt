{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'pygments' library modules; class definition with style configurations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks or external data processing; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from the class attributes to the Pygments rendering system; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a style configuration class for Pygments syntax highlighting. It imports specific token classes and assigns styling attributes such as colors, font styles, and text decorations. There are no functions, input/output handling, network operations, or code execution mechanisms. The structure is straightforward, static, and adheres to expected patterns for defining a style. No malicious or suspicious code features are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code serves as a static configuration for syntax highlighting and does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and intended for use in code presentation contexts.",
