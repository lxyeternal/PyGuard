{
  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments to customize code appearance.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.style and pygments.token modules, class definition with style mappings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static code with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static style definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports style and token modules from Pygments and defines a subclass PocooStyle. This subclass specifies a static dictionary of style mappings for various token types, assigning colors, font styles, and other text attributes. The code is purely declarative, setting visual styles for syntax highlighting, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static style definition for Pygments with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is purely for visual styling purposes and contains no malicious intent.",
