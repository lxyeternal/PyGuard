  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static configuration defining a custom style for Pygments.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- The code only imports modules and defines a class with style attributes.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n**Reports 1-6:**\n- All describe the code as a straightforward static style configuration.\n- They correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which seems appropriate given the static and benign nature.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, also appropriate.\n- Security risk score: 0, justified.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues found. The reasoning in each report is sound.\n- The style class is static, with no dynamic or suspicious elements.\n- The reports correctly dismiss any security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The style code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, static code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\n- The code is purely a style configuration for syntax highlighting, with no security implications.\n- The detailed reasoning in the reports aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate. The style code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
