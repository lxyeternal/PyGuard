{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments, a syntax highlighting library.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'pygments.token' module and class definition that assigns style attributes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data processing, external calls, or network interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code is solely a style configuration and does not process data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code solely configures styling parameters without suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific token classes from the Pygments library and defines a subclass 'PocooStyle' that specifies color schemes and styles for various token types used in syntax highlighting. The style configuration includes font styles, colors, and other visual attributes. There are no data input points, no external calls, and no executable logic that could be malicious. The code appears to be a straightforward style definition with no hidden or malicious functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a style configuration for Pygments syntax highlighting and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not process data, connect to networks, or perform any actions beyond style assignment.",
