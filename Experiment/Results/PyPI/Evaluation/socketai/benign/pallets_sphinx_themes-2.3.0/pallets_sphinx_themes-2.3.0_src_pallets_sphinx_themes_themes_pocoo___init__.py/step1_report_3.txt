  "purpose": "Define a custom syntax highlighting style for the Pygments library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Pygments token and style modules, class definition and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing with untrusted input detected; no external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; the code only sets style parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward style configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Pygments modules and defines a subclass 'PocooStyle' that sets various styling attributes for syntax highlighting. All attributes are statically assigned style strings, with no dynamic execution, data input/output, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are observed. The code strictly focuses on defining visual styles for syntax tokens.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious configuration for Pygments styling. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and solely related to visual styling.",
