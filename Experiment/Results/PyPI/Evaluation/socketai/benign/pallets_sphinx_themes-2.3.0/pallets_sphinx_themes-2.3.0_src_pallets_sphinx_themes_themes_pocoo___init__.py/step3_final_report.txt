  "purpose": "Defines a custom syntax highlighting style for Pygments using static token-to-style mappings.",
  "sources": "Imports from pygments.token and class attribute definitions within PocooStyle.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static style assignment without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static style class with no dynamic or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports token classes from Pygments and assigns style strings to each token type within a class. It contains no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The style definitions are static and declarative, serving solely as configuration for syntax highlighting. No obfuscation patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate zero security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static style configuration for Pygments with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its safe, declarative nature. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
