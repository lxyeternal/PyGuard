  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Sphinx extension for documenting Jinja components. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that inputs to import_object are sanitized to prevent importing malicious modules. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score of approximately 0.2–0.4 reflects the potential danger of dynamic import with untrusted input but no active malicious behavior."
