      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe configuration code for a Sphinx documentation project. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated components. The low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified by environment variable reliance but do not indicate any threat. All reports correctly assess the code as benign with appropriate scoring."

The other reports are benign or lack sufficient content for concern. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no significant adjustments are necessary."

No security risks, obfuscation, or malware are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Sphinx extension for documenting Jinja components. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that inputs to import_object are sanitized to prevent importing malicious modules. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score of approximately 0.2–0.4 reflects the potential danger of dynamic import with untrusted input but no active malicious behavior."

The main security risk is the execution of untrusted code, which is acceptable within a controlled environment. The scores are consistent with this assessment."
