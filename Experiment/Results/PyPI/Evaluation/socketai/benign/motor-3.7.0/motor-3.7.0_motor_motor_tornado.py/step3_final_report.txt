  "purpose": "Support module for integrating Tornado with the Motor MongoDB driver, creating framework-specific classes.",
  "sources": "Imports of internal modules and class creation functions; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external communication, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Class creation flow via create_class_with_framework; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules, defines a helper function to create classes with Tornado support, and instantiates multiple classes for MongoDB components. It is static, straightforward, and focuses solely on framework setup without any data processing, network activity, or external inputs. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard support module for Tornado integration with Motor. It contains no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
