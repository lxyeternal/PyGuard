  "purpose": "Implementation of an asynchronous GridFS interface for Motor, wrapping delegate classes for file operations and streaming with MongoDB.",
  "sources": "Data read from collection objects, delegate classes, method parameters, and file attributes.",
  "sinks": "MongoDB database operations, attribute accessors, streaming functions, and network handlers.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as file IDs, filenames, and delegate objects flow into database queries and streaming methods; outputs include file attributes, data chunks, and cursors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or covert data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard async wrapper around PyMongo's GridFS classes, utilizing delegate patterns and property management to provide an async interface. Cryptographic hashing for ETag generation is benign. No external network activity, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to expected patterns for database drivers.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, benign implementation of an async MongoDB GridFS interface. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (0.1) and zero malware likelihood are justified.",
