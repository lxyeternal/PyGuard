  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content and Security Implications**:\n   - All reports describe a minimal, straightforward code snippet: a license header and a single line defining a `TypeError` object with a fixed message.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or data processing.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code serves as support infrastructure, primarily to enforce callback validation.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report**:\n   - **Purpose & Analysis**: All reports agree that this is boilerplate support code, with no malicious intent or security risk.\n   - **Sources & Sinks**: No data flows or external interactions are present.\n   - **Anomalies**: None observed.\n   - **Confidence**: All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk**: All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - No issues are present in the code, and the reasoning is sound.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No assumptions are made beyond what the code shows.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is benign, standard support code with no security issues.\n   - The scores are appropriate.\n   - No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Final conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code fragment is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scoring aligns well with the content.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is purely boilerplate support code.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and should remain as is.",
