  "purpose": "Define a TypeError exception with a specific message for callback validation in asynchronous frameworks.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data, it only defines a constant exception object.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious constructs, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static snippet consisting of licensing comments and a single line defining a TypeError object with a fixed message. It serves as support infrastructure for callback validation in asynchronous code. There are no inputs, outputs, external interactions, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign, and it does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign support infrastructure with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
