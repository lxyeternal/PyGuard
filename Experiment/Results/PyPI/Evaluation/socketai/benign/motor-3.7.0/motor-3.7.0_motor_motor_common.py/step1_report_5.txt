{
  "purpose": "Provide common support code for asynchronous frameworks, specifically defining a callback type error.",
  "sources": "None (the code does not read external input or data).",
  "sinks": "None (the code does not write or process untrusted data).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow or source-to-sink paths present).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a constant error object for callback validation. It includes license comments, which are standard. There are no data inputs, network calls, or dangerous operations. The only statement is a TypeError instantiation for callback validation. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard support snippet for asynchronous frameworks with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
