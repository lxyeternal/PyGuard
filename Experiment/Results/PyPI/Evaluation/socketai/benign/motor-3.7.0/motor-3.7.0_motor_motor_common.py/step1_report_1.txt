  "purpose": "Provides common support functions for asynchronous frameworks in MongoDB-related code.",
  "sources": "Defines a TypeError for callback validation.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow analysis needed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard code with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single line defining a TypeError for callback validation. It does not read input, process untrusted data, or perform any operations that could lead to security issues. There are no external calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely boilerplate, licensing, and a simple type error definition for callback validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
