{
  "purpose": "Provides common support code for asynchronous frameworks in MongoDB's Python driver",
  "sources": "The code defines a TypeError message for callback validation",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows identified, as the code is only defining an exception message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header and a single line defining a TypeError object with a specific message. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. It appears to be a simple, static code fragment intended for use elsewhere. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard support code snippet with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is part of the library's infrastructure to enforce callback validity.",
