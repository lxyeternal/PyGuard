  "purpose": "Provide common support functions for asynchronous frameworks in MongoDB driver code.",
  "sources": "Import statements and variable initialization; specifically the creation of a TypeError object.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code simply defines a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a license header, docstring, and a single variable assignment defining a TypeError for callback validation. It appears to be part of a larger library, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security issues. There are no data sources or sinks, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a benign part of a support library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly initializes a type error message for callback validation. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
