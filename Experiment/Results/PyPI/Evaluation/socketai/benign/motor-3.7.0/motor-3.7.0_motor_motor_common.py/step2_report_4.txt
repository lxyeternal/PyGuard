  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Content Review:**\n- The code is a licensing header followed by a single line:\n  ```python\n  callback_type_error = TypeError(\"callback must be a callable\")\n  ```\n- There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n- The code simply defines a constant exception object for use elsewhere.\n\n**Security and Malicious Behavior Assessment:**\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or data sinks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive information.\n- The code is purely static, supporting asynchronous framework functionality.\n\n**Scores and Reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0. The code does not introduce any security risk; it’s standard support code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify that this is boilerplate support code with no security concerns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is benign, standard support code, and poses no security threat.",
