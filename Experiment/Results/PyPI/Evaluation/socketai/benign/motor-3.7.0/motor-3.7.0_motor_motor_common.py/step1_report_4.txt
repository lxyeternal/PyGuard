  "purpose": "Provide common support code for async frameworks, specifically defining a callback type error.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential points of data leakage identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink within the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual constructs, just a simple error message definition.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a TypeError with a fixed message related to callback functions. It includes license information and a comment header. There are no functions, data inputs, outputs, or suspicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign support code for async framework utilities. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
