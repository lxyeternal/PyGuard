  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code fragment carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, static snippet with licensing comments.\n- It defines a single variable: `callback_type_error = TypeError(\"callback must be a callable\")`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, malicious constructs, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and contains only a straightforward type error definition for callback validation. There are no security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as boilerplate support code with no security implications.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n### Any unreasonable score adjustments?  \n- No, the scores are consistent and justified based on the code.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code fragment is typical for a support library, defining an exception to be used elsewhere.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and the analysis rightly dismisses any malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, straightforward support snippet with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.",
