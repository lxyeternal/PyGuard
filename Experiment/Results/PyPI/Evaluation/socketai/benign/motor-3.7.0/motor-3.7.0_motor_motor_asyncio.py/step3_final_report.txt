  "purpose": "Provides asyncio support for MongoDB driver classes by dynamically creating class wrappers with framework support.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports, class creation via create_class_with_framework, and core/motor_gridfs components.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Class definitions created through create_asyncio_class function, wrapping core components without external input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic class creation via create_class_with_framework; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules, defines a factory function for creating asyncio-compatible classes, and generates multiple driver classes. It does not process external inputs, execute network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The pattern is typical for framework adapters, and no security issues are evident. The dynamic class creation is standard and justified in this context. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup for asyncio support in a MongoDB driver, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is justified due to the dynamic class creation pattern, which is common in such frameworks.",
