  "purpose": "Define and create asynchronous MongoDB driver classes using asyncio framework for Motor.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.core, .frameworks, .metaprogramming), and class creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Class creation via create_class_with_framework, which does not involve untrusted input; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> class creation functions -> class definitions for MongoDB components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no obfuscated patterns, no network or system calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, defines a list of public objects, and creates classes with a framework helper function. It does not process external inputs, execute dynamic code, or interact with the environment directly. The pattern suggests standard library setup for asynchronous MongoDB drivers, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for an asyncio-based MongoDB driver with class definitions. No malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks detected.",
