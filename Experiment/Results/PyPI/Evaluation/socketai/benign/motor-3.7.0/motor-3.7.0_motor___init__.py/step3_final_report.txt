  "purpose": "Manage version information and optionally import Tornado support for the Motor MongoDB driver.",
  "sources": "Import of version info from ._version; attempt to import 'tornado' library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication; import statements are safe.",
  "flows": "Version info import; optional 'tornado' import and re-export of classes if available.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version management code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package, handling version info and optional dependencies. It uses typical try-except for optional imports, with no data processing, network activity, or execution of untrusted code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is clear and aligns with best practices for optional dependency management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical package initialization script, managing version info and optional Tornado support safely.",
