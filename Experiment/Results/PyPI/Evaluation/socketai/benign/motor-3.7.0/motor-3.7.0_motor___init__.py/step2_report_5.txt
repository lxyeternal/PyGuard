  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: a module that manages version info and optionally imports the 'tornado' library for asynchronous support.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, user input handling, or network operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The import pattern (try-except for optional dependencies) is standard in Python packages.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Issue Presence Confirmation:\n- The code as provided does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- The import statements and conditional logic are standard and benign.\n- No untrusted data is processed, and no sensitive information is handled or leaked.\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning in each report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code.\n- The only minor point is that the code handles optional dependencies gracefully, which is good practice.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or 0.5, but given the absence of any security concerns, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Potential Risks and Justifications:\n- The code does **not** execute untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or file operations beyond imports.\n- The optional import of 'tornado' is handled safely, with fallback to None.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious code.\n\n### Consistency and Reasonableness:\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n- The high confidence (1.0) in the reports aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, safe module initialization script for the Motor MongoDB driver, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is legitimate, safe, and free from vulnerabilities or malicious elements. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.",
