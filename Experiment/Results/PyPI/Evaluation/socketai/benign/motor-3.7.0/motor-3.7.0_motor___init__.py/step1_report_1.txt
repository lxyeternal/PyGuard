{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and sets up the Motor asynchronous driver for MongoDB, manages version information, and conditionally imports Tornado support if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version info from ._version and optional import of tornado and motor_tornado modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leak, code execution, or other security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to conditional import of tornado and motor_tornado, with no data or untrusted input handling beyond module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures present. The code is straightforward, handling optional imports and version management.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages module metadata and optional dependencies. It attempts to import tornado and conditionally exposes Tornado-related classes. The only dynamic aspect is the optional import, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The code does not process untrusted input or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for the Motor MongoDB driver, with optional Tornado support. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
