  "purpose": "This code initializes the Motor asynchronous driver for MongoDB, importing version info and optional Tornado support.",
  "sources": "Imports version information from internal modules and conditionally imports tornado if available.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Version info imports are static; conditional import of tornado does not involve untrusted data. No flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and consistent with standard package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines licensing and version info, and conditionally imports the 'tornado' library for asynchronous support. The optional import pattern is standard, and the code handles ImportError gracefully. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No data input sources or untrusted data processing is present. The structure and purpose align with typical Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization script for the Motor MongoDB driver, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages optional dependencies and version info.",
