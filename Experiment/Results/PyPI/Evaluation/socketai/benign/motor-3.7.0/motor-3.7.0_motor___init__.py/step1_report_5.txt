{
  "purpose": "To define version information and import optional Tornado dependencies for the Motor MongoDB driver.",
  "sources": "The module imports version info from ._version and attempts to import the 'tornado' library.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data exposure present.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows; only static imports and conditional import of an external library.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package initialization code with conditional import. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles version info and conditional import of the Tornado library. It includes a try-except block to import 'tornado', setting it to None if not available, and conditionally imports modules for backwards compatibility. No user input, untrusted data, or network communication occurs. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign part of a Python package that manages optional dependencies and version info. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
