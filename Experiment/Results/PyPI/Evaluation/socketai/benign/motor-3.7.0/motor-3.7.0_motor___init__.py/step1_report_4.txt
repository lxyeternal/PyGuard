{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous MongoDB driver (Motor) with versioning and optional Tornado support.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information from imported modules and attempts to import the 'tornado' library if available.",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing version info, conditionally importing 'tornado', and exposing Tornado classes if available.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code performs standard import and conditional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles version information and optional dependencies. It uses try-except for safe import of 'tornado' and re-exports classes conditionally. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident; it is standard library setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard, benign library setup script for Motor, an asynchronous MongoDB driver. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified.",
