  "purpose": "Provide version parsing and formatting utilities for the motor package.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ variable, reading input from the version string parameter.",
  "sinks": "No significant sink points; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "get_version_tuple reads __version__ and parses it; get_version_string returns __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and provides functions to parse it into a tuple and to retrieve it as a string. Uses regex to parse version components, which is standard practice. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code present. No external data inputs or outputs that could be exploited. The only operations are string parsing and data returning, typical for version handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version utility without malicious intent or security risks. It performs version parsing and retrieval in a standard manner, with no indications of supply chain attack or malicious behavior.",
