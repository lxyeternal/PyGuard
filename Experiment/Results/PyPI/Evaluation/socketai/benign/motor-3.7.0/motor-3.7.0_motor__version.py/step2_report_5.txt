  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward utility for parsing a hardcoded version string (`__version__`) into a tuple and providing access functions.\n   - The regex pattern is standard for semantic versioning, and no untrusted data sources, external sinks, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n   - The code performs simple string parsing and data retrieval, typical for version management.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code does not contain any security issues or malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n   - The reasoning that the code is safe and standard is sound.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify a zero risk score.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity—no code injection, network activity, or obfuscation.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They focus on the actual code behavior, which is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign utility module for version parsing.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis above. There are no indications of supply chain risk or malicious intent in this code snippet.",
