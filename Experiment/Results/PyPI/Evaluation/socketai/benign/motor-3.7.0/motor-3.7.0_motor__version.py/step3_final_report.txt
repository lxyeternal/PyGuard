  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and retrieving version information from a hardcoded version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded string '__version__' and uses regex matching for parsing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The version string '__version__' flows into the regex parsing function, which produces a tuple; the version string is returned by a simple getter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the regex and logic are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that defines a static version string, parses it into a tuple using regex, and provides functions to access the version data. It involves no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The regex pattern is standard for semantic versioning, and error handling is appropriate. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version parsing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safety, and the scores should reflect this.",
