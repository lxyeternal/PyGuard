{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to parse and return version information for the 'motor' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__version__' string variable and input parameters of 'get_version_tuple'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or other effects.",
  "flows": "The input version string flows into 'get_version_tuple', which processes and returns version components; no external data flows into or out of the functions beyond this input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The regex pattern and parsing logic are standard for version parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward version string parsing with regular expressions and string manipulation. It includes input validation and error handling. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations are present. The use of standard library functions and pattern matching does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for version parsing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to extract and format version information.",
