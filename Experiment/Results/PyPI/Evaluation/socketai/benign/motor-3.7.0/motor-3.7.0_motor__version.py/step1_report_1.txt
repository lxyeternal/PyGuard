{
  "purpose": "Provides version parsing and retrieval functions for the motor library.",
  "sources": "Reads the module's __version__ string and regex patterns for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Uses the __version__ string as input; processes it through regex matching; returns version information.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation observed. Uses standard regex for parsing version strings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports re for regex operations, defines a fixed version string, and parses it into a tuple with optional parts. The get_version_tuple function matches semantic versioning patterns and extracts components, appending any additional suffixes. No untrusted data sources or dangerous sinks are present. The code performs straightforward string parsing and version retrieval with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling version information. It contains no malicious activity, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It simply parses a hardcoded version string and provides functions to access version data.",
