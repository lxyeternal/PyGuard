{
  "purpose": "Provides version information and parsing functions for the motor package.",
  "sources": "Reads the hardcoded string __version__ and the input parameter 'version' in get_version_tuple().",
  "sinks": "None. No untrusted data handling or output to external systems observed.",
  "flows": "The get_version_tuple() function processes the __version__ string, converting it into a tuple. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. Uses regex for version parsing, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and functions to parse it into a tuple, handling different version formats. It includes a regex pattern to extract version components and converts them to integers or strings as needed. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling observed. The license header is standard for open-source projects. The code structure and logic are straightforward and typical for version handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward version parsing logic with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is typical for package version management.",
