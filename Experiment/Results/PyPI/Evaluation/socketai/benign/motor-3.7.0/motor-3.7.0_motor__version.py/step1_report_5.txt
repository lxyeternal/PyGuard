{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions to parse and return version information for the motor library.",
  "sources": "The source reads the __version__ string and user-provided version string in get_version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input (__version__ string) flows into get_version_tuple, which processes and returns version components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports re for regex parsing, defines a version string, and provides functions to parse it into a tuple or return it as a string. The regex pattern extracts major, minor, and patch parts, with optional rest. The functions perform straightforward string parsing without external input or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for version parsing with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
