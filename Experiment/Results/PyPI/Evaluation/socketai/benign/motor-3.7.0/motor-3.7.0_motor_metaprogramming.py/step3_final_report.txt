  "purpose": "Provides dynamic class creation and method wrapping for Motor, an asynchronous MongoDB driver, enabling async operations with PyMongo classes.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, method references (e.g., sync_method), and class introspection (inspect.getmro).",
  "sinks": "Calls to framework.run_on_executor() with potentially untrusted arguments, dynamic method wrappers, and class attribute access.",
  "flows": "Source data (class attributes, method references) flow into wrapper functions which invoke framework methods, passing unwrapped or delegated objects.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard dynamic class and method wrapping patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dynamic class creation, attribute delegation, and method wrapping for async support. It accesses class attributes, wraps methods with decorators, and creates new classes with caching. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Potential security considerations relate to untrusted data flowing into framework functions like run_on_executor(), but this is typical for such frameworks and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an async wrapper for PyMongo classes in Motor. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The slight security risk score reflects the inherent risks of dynamic execution if external inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is detected.",
