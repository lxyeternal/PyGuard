  "sinks": "No data input or output, no untrusted data handling, no network calls, and no system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the content is purely descriptive documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The entire content is composed of API documentation strings with illustrative examples. No executable code, no data processing, and no network activity are included. The documentation is standard, clear, and intended for developer reference. Given the absence of active code or malicious patterns, the risk and malware scores are appropriately zero. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward, benign nature of the content.",
  "conclusion": "The provided content is purely documentation with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and accurate.",
