  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code in question is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and follows common practices.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- Confidence is high (1), indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n- **Presence of issues?** No. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores assigned?** All reports give malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review:\n- **Malware Score:** Correctly 0. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0. No obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** Correctly 0. The script is static configuration, not executing any runtime logic that could pose a security risk.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- Since the code is static and contains no external data handling, dynamic code, or obfuscation, there is no reason to adjust scores.\n- The reports' reasoning is sound, and their conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical, well-formed `setup.py` script.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The high confidence scores are appropriate.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Scores:** Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is benign, and the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and correct. The code is a standard package setup script with no security concerns. No changes are necessary.",
