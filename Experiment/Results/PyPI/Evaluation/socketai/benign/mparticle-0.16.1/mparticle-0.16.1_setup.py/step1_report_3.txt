  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'mparticle' Python SDK package.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from variables, import statements, and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "Installation process via setup(), potentially affecting the system environment or dependencies during package installation.",
  "flows": "User runs 'python setup.py install' which triggers package installation, dependencies are resolved and installed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code strictly adheres to standard setup.py conventions with no suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines package metadata, dependencies, and calls setup() with proper arguments. No user input is processed, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs are present. The comments and variables are clear and standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data flows, or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for distributing the 'mparticle' SDK.",
