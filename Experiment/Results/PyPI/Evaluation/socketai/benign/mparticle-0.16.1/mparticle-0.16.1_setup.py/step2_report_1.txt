  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- No untrusted input handling, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Confirmations & Validations:**\n- The code matches the description: a typical setup.py script with static metadata and dependencies.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security or contain malware.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports give a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are consistently 0, which is justified.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- Since the code is static and standard, there are no grounds to adjust the scores.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based solely on this code snippet.\n- The reports are thorough and align with the code's content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications or higher risk scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is warranted.",
