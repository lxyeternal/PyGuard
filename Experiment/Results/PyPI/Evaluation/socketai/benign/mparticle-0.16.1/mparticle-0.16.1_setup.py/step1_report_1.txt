  "sources": "Imports from sys and setuptools; constants for package metadata; setup() function call with package details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data processing present; no potential data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package metadata and invocation of setup(), no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python library. It imports standard modules, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with fixed values. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The script adheres to common packaging practices and does not contain malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
