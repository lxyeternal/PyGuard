{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the mParticle Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`sys`, `setuptools`); variable definitions (`NAME`, `VERSION`, `REQUIRES`); setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code mainly defines metadata and dependencies for package installation.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; setup configuration data is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. No external data inputs or network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration without any dynamic or unsafe operations. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are detected. The dependencies are normal Python packages. No sources lead to dangerous sinks. The script's purpose is to facilitate the installation of the SDK, not execute runtime logic or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
