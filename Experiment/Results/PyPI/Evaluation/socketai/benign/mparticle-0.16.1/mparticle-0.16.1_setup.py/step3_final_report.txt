{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python SDK, defining package metadata and dependencies without any dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, import statements, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the script does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The script executes sequentially to define package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and follows common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only standard modules, defines static metadata, and calls setup() with fixed arguments. No dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is solely to package the SDK, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications or higher risk scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
