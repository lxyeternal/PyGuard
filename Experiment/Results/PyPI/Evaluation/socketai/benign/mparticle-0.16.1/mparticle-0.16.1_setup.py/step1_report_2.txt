  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'mparticle' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, setuptools), constants (NAME, VERSION, REQUIRES), and setup() function with metadata and requirements.",
  "sinks": "None; no direct data sinks or external data handling present in setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Import sys and setuptools (source), then invoke setup() with package metadata (sink). No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a standard setup script with no unusual patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (sys, setuptools), defines package metadata and dependencies, and calls setup() to prepare the package for distribution. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors. The code solely performs package configuration as intended for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward setup configuration file for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
