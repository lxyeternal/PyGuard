{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the mParticle SDK's AppEvent model, verifying attribute assignment, exception handling, and factory methods.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded attribute values within test functions, no external data or network calls.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static test data used, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, auto-generated test code with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated unit test suite for the AppEvent class, with no external data processing, network activity, or malicious constructs. It performs attribute validation and exception testing using fixed data. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The tests confirm expected behavior and do not interact with external systems or sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for testing SDK functionality, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
