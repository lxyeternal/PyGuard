  "purpose": "Unit tests for mParticle AppEvent model to verify correct behavior and input validation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; uses hardcoded test data and class methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Test methods create AppEvent objects with predefined data, then verify attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines unit tests using the unittest framework. It creates instances of AppEvent with hardcoded attributes and verifies their properties. No external inputs are accepted at runtime, and no sensitive data handling or network communication occurs. The code does not contain dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or any malicious behavior. It is straightforward test code designed for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for the AppEvent model, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
