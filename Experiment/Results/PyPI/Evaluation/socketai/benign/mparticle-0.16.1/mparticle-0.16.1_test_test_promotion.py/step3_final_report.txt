{
  "purpose": "This code is a boilerplate unit test stub for the mParticle SDK's Promotion model, generated for testing object instantiation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the imported modules and the instantiation of the Promotion object in the test method.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to creating an instance of Promotion within the test method; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated unit test stub with no network calls, environment variable access, or dynamic code execution. It only instantiates a Promotion object for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks are evident. The code's simplicity and generated nature indicate it is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated test scaffold with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals point to a safe, standard testing utility with no supply chain security concerns.",
