  "purpose": "Unit test stub for mParticle Promotion model in the SDK",
  "sources": "import statements (os, sys, unittest, mparticle, mparticle.rest.ApiException, mparticle.models.promotion.Promotion)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or output sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely for testing and imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard boilerplate for unit testing with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test stub generated for the mParticle SDK. It imports standard modules and SDK components, sets up an empty test case class, and runs unittest.main() if executed directly. No external data, user input, or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code behavior detected. The code appears to be boilerplate for testing the Promotion model and does not include any harmful or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated unit test stub for the mParticle SDK with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
