{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test stub for the mParticle Promotion model, intended for testing the Promotion class within the mParticle SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, unittest, and mparticle modules; reads class definitions and test setup methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data processing or output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely defines a test class and runs unittest.main() without external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be a standard generated test stub without obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and the mparticle SDK, defines a unittest class with placeholder setup and test methods. It creates an instance of Promotion but does not perform any data operations, network calls, or data handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, credential access, or hidden backdoors. The code is a typical generated test scaffold for a SDK model.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, generated test stub for the mParticle SDK promotion model. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. It simply sets up a framework for future unit tests.",
