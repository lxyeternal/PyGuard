  "purpose": "Unit testing for the mParticle UserAttributeChangeEvent model in a Python SDK",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and classes (unittest, mparticle, UserAttributeChangeEvent), instantiation of models and batch objects",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or written to external systems",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only creates objects and runs assertions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the SDK's model classes, defines a test class with setup, teardown, and a test method. The test method instantiates a UserAttributeChangeEvent with hardcoded test data and adds it to a Batch object. It then verifies that the event properties match expected values through assertions. No data is read from untrusted sources, no external network communication, nor any code that could be malicious. The code is straightforward and typical of a unit test suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for a Python SDK model with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and purely for testing purposes.",
