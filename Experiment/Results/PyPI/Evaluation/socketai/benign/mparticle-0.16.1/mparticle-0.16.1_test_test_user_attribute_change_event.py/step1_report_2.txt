  "purpose": "Unit testing for the mParticle UserAttributeChangeEvent model",
  "sources": "Imports from mparticle.models.user_attribute_change_event and mparticle.Batch, creation of UserAttributeChangeEvent instance",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, external calls, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Instantiation of UserAttributeChangeEvent from hardcoded values, adding to batch, assertions on object attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns; use of unittest framework for testing",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test for the mParticle SDK's UserAttributeChangeEvent model. It imports necessary modules, creates a test event with fixed values, adds it to a batch, and performs assertions to verify properties. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or sensitive operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code is well-structured, standard for testing, and relies on the mParticle SDK's internal classes.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a unit test for the mParticle SDK and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any external network operations, data leaks, or sabotage actions. The likelihood of malware or security risks is very low.",
