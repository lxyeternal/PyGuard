  "purpose": "Unit testing for the mParticle DataPlanContext model, verifying plan_id and optional plan_version fields.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (os, sys, unittest), and mparticle package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no untrusted data output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded strings and integers) used to instantiate DataPlanContext objects and their conversion to dict.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing without any dynamic or malicious code execution. It imports necessary modules, defines a test class with setup and teardown methods, and runs two simple tests verifying object properties. No input from external sources or untrusted data is processed or transmitted. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or file manipulations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign unit test for a data model. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
