  "purpose": "Unit testing the CCPAConsentState data model for correctness and attribute assignment.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within test cases, system time generated via calendar and time modules.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network activity, or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of model with hardcoded values, assertions verifying attribute correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs in-memory tests only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test suite for a data model, with no external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code. It verifies attribute assignment with static data and system-generated timestamps. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are present. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of external data flows, network operations, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
