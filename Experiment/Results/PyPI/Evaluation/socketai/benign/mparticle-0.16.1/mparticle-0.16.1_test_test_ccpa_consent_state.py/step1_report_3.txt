  "purpose": "Unit testing for the CCPAConsentState model in the mParticle SDK.",
  "sources": "Reading the current time via calendar and time modules, importing models and classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only sets and asserts values.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded strings and generated timestamps) are assigned to model attributes and checked via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward test setup with no obfuscated logic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test for a data model, creating instances with hardcoded values and verifying attribute assignments. It uses system modules to generate timestamps and sets model properties directly. No dynamic or external input processing occurs, and there are no network operations or file manipulations. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical unit testing script for a data model with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is used for validating data model behavior within the SDK framework.",
