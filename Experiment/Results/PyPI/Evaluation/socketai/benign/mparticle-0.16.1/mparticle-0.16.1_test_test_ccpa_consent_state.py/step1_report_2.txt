  "purpose": "Unit testing for the CCPAConsentState model in the mParticle SDK.",
  "sources": "Input data from hardcoded strings and current time (calendar.timegm), reading environment variables or system info indirectly via imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data output or network communication present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded values and system time into model attributes; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets beyond typical test data. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test module using standard Python libraries and the mParticle SDK. It creates instances of CCPAConsentState with hardcoded strings and current timestamp, verifying attribute assignments. No network activity, file I/O, or untrusted data processing occurs. The imports are standard, with no suspicious or unnecessary modules. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit testing script for a SDK model class. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
