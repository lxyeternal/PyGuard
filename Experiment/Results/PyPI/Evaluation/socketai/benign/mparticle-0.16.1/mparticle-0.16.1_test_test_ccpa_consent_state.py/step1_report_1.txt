{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the CCPAConsentState model in the mParticle SDK",
  "sources": "Code reads system time via calendar.timegm and time.gmtime; reads input data from hardcoded string literals within test cases",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent to external sources or written insecurely",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow present; test data is hardcoded and used for validation purposes only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python unit test module for a data model. It uses standard libraries (os, sys, calendar, time) for generating test timestamps. The test class creates instances of CCPAConsentState with predefined data and verifies attribute correctness. No input from external sources or user input is processed, and there are no network or system manipulations. The code is straightforward, follows common testing patterns, and does not include suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test suite with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or malicious side-effects. All operations are limited to in-memory tests and data validation.",
