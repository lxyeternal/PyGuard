  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CCPAConsentState model in the mParticle SDK, used for testing consent data handling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string values for document, location, hardware_id, and timestamp generated via calendar and time modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code creates objects with hardcoded data and verifies their attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior detected. The code only performs straightforward unit testing without dynamic data or external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard unit test suite for a specific data model. It imports necessary modules, defines test cases, initializes data with static and generated values, and verifies attribute correctness. No external input handling, network activity, or sensitive data processing is involved. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit testing script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly tests the data model and contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
