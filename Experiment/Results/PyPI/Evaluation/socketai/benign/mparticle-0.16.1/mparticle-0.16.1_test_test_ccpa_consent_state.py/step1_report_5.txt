{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the CCPAConsentState model in the mParticle SDK",
  "sources": "Inputs to the CCPAConsentState constructor, attributes set directly on the model instance, time and calendar modules for timestamp generation",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., consent details, device info) assigned to model attributes without processing or external communication",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard use of Python modules and SDK classes",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test implementation that creates instances of CCPAConsentState, assigns attribute values, and asserts correctness. It uses current time generation via standard modules and does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The structure and logic are typical for test code and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit testing script for a data model with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
