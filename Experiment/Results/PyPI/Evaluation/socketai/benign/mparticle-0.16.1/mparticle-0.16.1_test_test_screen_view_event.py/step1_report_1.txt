  "purpose": "Unit testing for the mParticle ScreenViewEvent model to validate attribute handling and custom flags.",
  "sources": "Reads input from test case initializations, attribute assignments, and method calls within the test class.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing, output, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to object attributes (custom_attributes, custom_flags) flows through validation methods without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no obfuscated logic. Use of standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unittests module for a generated SDK model. It tests attribute validation and serialization. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. No external network activity or system manipulation is evident. The code strictly performs validation and serialization checks within a controlled test environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate unit tests for a generated SDK model with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
