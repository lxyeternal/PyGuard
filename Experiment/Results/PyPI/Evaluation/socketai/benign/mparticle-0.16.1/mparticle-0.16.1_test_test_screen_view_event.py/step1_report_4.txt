{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the ScreenViewEvent class in the mParticle SDK, focusing on validation of custom attributes and custom flags.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, sys, unittest, and mparticle modules; class and method definitions; object instantiations; attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data output, network operations, or file writes observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (custom_attributes, custom_flags) flows into object instantiation and attribute setting; validation functions check data correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for the mParticle SDK's ScreenViewEvent class. It performs validation checks on custom attributes and flags, raising exceptions on invalid input. It imports standard modules and a specific SDK component, then defines test cases that do not perform network operations or system modifications. The code is typical for testing, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit testing script for SDK validation, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
