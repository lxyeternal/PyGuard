  "purpose": "Unit testing for the mParticle ScreenViewEvent class, validating attribute handling and custom flags.",
  "sources": "Imports modules os, sys, unittest; reads class and method definitions; accesses mparticle.models.screen_view_event.ScreenViewEvent and its attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows leading to potential data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is a standard unit test with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and mParticle SDK components for testing purposes. It defines test cases to validate the behavior of ScreenViewEvent objects, particularly focusing on custom_attributes and custom_flags. The test functions raise ValueError intentionally to verify exception handling. The code is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious payloads. It performs typical unit testing procedures without any suspicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate unit test script for the mParticle SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The script is safe and intended for testing functionality.",
