  "purpose": "Unit tests for the mParticle ScreenViewEvent model, validating attribute handling and serialization.",
  "sources": "Input validation in test cases, setting custom_attributes and custom_flags, serialization via to_dict().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data flow, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to object attributes → validation raises exceptions or data serialized to dict.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward validation and serialization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated, standard unit test suite for a SDK model, performing validation checks and serialization tests. It raises ValueError on invalid attribute assignment, which is expected. No external interactions, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The code structure and logic are typical for SDK validation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs standard validation and serialization, and contains no malicious or security-risk elements. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
