{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the ScreenViewEvent class from the mParticle SDK, including validation of custom attributes and custom flags.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os, sys, unittest, and mparticle modules, and the instantiation of ScreenViewEvent objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling points; no network or file I/O, no data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to dangerous sinks; the code mainly performs validation and object attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated constructs; standard unit test structure and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test suite for the mParticle SDK's ScreenViewEvent class. It tests validation logic for custom_attributes and custom_flags. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious constructs are present. The code does not perform any harmful actions, nor does it contain suspicious code or backdoors. It simply validates object behaviors within a test framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit testing script for the mParticle SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
