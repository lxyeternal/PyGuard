{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test stub for the SessionStartEvent model in the mParticle SDK, likely used for testing the API integration.",
  "sources": "Imports from the os, sys, and unittest modules; loading the SessionStartEvent model from mparticle.models.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources to sinks; code primarily initializes an object for testing purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard test stub structure, no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical unit test file generated for SDK testing, with no dynamic input handling, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious behavior. It imports standard modules and the mParticle SDK components, defines a test class with setup and teardown methods, and a test method that instantiates a model object. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated unit test stub for SDK testing, containing no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risk.",
