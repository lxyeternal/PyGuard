  "sources": "Import statements (os, sys, unittest, mparticle, and related modules)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; test code primarily initializes objects",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only creates an object instance",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test stub for the OptOutEvent model, imported from the mparticle package. It does not process input, perform network communication, or execute any suspicious or malicious operations. The code follows standard Python testing conventions with no obfuscated or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign unit test stub for a data model. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
