{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'flask-expects-json', including package metadata, dependencies, and testing configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'; no other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present; setup script primarily specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the script does not process or execute external data beyond package metadata and dependency declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code structure is typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and optional extras. It uses safe, common Python practices and does not include any dynamic execution or external code fetching beyond dependency declarations. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
