{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'flask-expects-json' Python package, used to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package metadata fields, dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into the 'long_description' parameter; dependencies and package info are set directly from static code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code structures detected. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns. The code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging. It reads a markdown file for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and test suite. There are no dynamic code executions, no input from external sources, nor any suspicious patterns or code injections. All dependencies are from known repositories, and no side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely defines package information for distribution without involving any malicious or suspicious code.",
