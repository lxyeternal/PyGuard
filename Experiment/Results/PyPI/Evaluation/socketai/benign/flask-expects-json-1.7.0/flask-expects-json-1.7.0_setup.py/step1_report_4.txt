  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'flask-expects-json', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, package metadata, and dependencies from 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external data or inputs; the code only reads local files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code performs standard setup procedures with clear metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and configurations. All code is standard for Python package setup scripts. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No suspicious or malicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration script for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks.",
