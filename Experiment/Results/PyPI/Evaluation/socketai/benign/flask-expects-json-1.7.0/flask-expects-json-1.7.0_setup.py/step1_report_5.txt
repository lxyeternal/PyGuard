  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'flask-expects-json', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data or external inputs; it mainly sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Readme() function reads static file content, which is then used in setup() without any modification or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements are present. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging practices with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no input/output that could be exploited. All data sources are static files or hardcoded strings. No suspicious code patterns or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
