  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for packaging the 'flask-expects-json' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and test setup.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static data used for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling beyond static file reading. It declares dependencies from reputable sources and follows standard practices. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the structure is clear and well-formed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
