  "purpose": "A Flask decorator for validating incoming JSON request payloads against a specified schema, with options for default filling, format checking, and method ignoring.",
  "sources": "request.get_json(), request.method, current_app, g.data",
  "sinks": "Validation functions (validate, ExtendedDefaultValidator), abort calls, assignment to g.data",
  "flows": "request.get_json() → validation functions → abort on failure or store in g.data → proceed to route handler",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask decorator that performs JSON schema validation with optional default filling and format checking. It handles validation errors gracefully and stores validated data in g.data. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code uses well-known libraries and patterns, with no network activity or code injection. The error handling for ignore_for parameter is appropriate, raising an error if a non-iterable string is passed, which is a correct safeguard. The overall structure and logic are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured Flask JSON validation decorator with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), aligning with its benign, standard validation purpose.",
