  "purpose": "A decorator for Flask routes that validates incoming JSON requests against a specified schema, optionally filling defaults and checking formats.",
  "sources": "request.get_json() for incoming data, request.method for method type, current_app.ensure_sync for execution context, data validation functions.",
  "sinks": "abort() calls for validation failures, setting g.data with validated data, calling the wrapped function, potential exception handling.",
  "flows": "Request data read via request.get_json(), validated against schema, on success stored in g.data, then proceeds to route handler.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, use of external validation libraries is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask decorator for JSON schema validation. It reads JSON input using request.get_json(), which could potentially be manipulated if the source is malicious, but this is standard practice. Validation is performed via jsonschema.validate or an extended validator, which is expected to be a normal validation step. The decorator aborts with 400 on invalid JSON or validation errors, which is standard for API input validation. The use of current_app.ensure_sync is for async support and is not suspicious. There are no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or external network calls. The code’s purpose is validation, with no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask JSON validation decorator with no malicious intent. It performs input validation and error handling securely without suspicious behavior or malicious code. The use of external libraries is normal for schema validation. No security risks are identified.",
