  "purpose": "Define type annotations and a paginator class for the repostspace service client, facilitating pagination over list_spaces responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for system info, typing, and boto3 paginators; type definitions; the class constructor and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method 'paginate' accepting user-provided keyword arguments, potentially untrusted data, used in boto3 API calls.",
  "flows": "User supplies arguments to 'paginate', which are unpacked into API calls within the method.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of type annotations and conditional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a paginator class for the repostspace service, utilizing type annotations for improved static analysis. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' based on Python version. The 'paginate' method wraps a boto3 paginator call, accepting user parameters. No network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. No suspicious logic or code anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a boto3 paginator with type annotations. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
