  "purpose": "Type annotations and documentation for the repostspace service client's paginator classes in boto3-stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; no external untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; no data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of conditional import based on Python version is standard and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type annotations, paginator class inheritance, and documentation links. It employs conditional imports for compatibility, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type definition file intended for type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, primarily serving as a type annotation and documentation aid for the boto3 repostspace paginator classes. No malicious activity or security issues are detected.",
