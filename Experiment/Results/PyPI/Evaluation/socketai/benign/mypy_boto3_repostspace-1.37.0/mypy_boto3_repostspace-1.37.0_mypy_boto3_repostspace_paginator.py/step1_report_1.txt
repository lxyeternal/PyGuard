  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class for the repostspace service client, facilitating type-safe pagination of 'list_spaces' API calls.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys module; TYPE_CHECKING, ListSpacesInputPaginateTypeDef, ListSpacesOutputTypeDef; environment variables; external libraries (botocore, typing, typing_extensions); internal module imports.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code mainly defines type annotations and a class extension for pagination.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow detected. The paginate method accepts **kwargs that are unpacked into type-defined parameters but are not sourced from untrusted input within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code segments present. The code appears to follow standard boto3 paginator pattern with type annotations, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a paginator class for the repostspace service, including type annotations for safe API call pagination. It uses conditional import based on Python version, which is standard. No external input handling, network operations, or code execution occurs here. The code is purely for typing and class inheritance, following boto3 and mypy conventions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of a boto3 paginator with type annotations. No malicious intent or security risks are identified. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
