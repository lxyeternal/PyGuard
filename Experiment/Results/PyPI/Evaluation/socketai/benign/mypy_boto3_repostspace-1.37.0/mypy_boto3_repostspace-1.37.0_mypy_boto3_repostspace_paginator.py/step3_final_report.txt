  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for repostspace service client, serving documentation and type safety.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, botocore.paginate, type definitions, environment info for Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; 'paginate' method accepts kwargs but from controlled API usage.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into 'paginate' method, which returns a PageIterator; no external data leaks or malicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with conditional import for compatibility, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard boto3 paginator stub with type annotations, documentation links, and class inheritance. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The structure is typical for SDK type stubs, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The 'paginate' method uses **kwargs** for API parameters, which is standard and safe in this context. The conditional import for 'Unpack' ensures compatibility across Python versions but does not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of boto3 paginator type stubs, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature.",
