  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-repostspace package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and reading package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not execute or execute untrusted data, nor does it perform network or file operations beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md → passing static data to setup() → no external data flows or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard Python packaging conventions without suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious intent. No data leaks, credential usage, or network activity is present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal Python package setup file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
