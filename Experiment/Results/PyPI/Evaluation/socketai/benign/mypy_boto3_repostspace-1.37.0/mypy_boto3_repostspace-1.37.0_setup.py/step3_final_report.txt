  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-repostspace, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, or external data sources; no network activity or code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, performing static configuration tasks. It reads a local README file and calls setuptools.setup() with fixed metadata. No dynamic code, external inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The scores are consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no security threat, and the analysis aligns with best practices for static package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. The package poses no supply chain security concerns.",
