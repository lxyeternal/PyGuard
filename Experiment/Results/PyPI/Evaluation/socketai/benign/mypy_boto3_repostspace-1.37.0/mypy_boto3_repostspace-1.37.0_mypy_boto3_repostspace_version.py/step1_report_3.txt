  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output that could be exploited",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a docstring comment, a copyright statement, and a variable assignment for __version__. The version string is statically set to '1.37.0'. There are no input sources, no data processing, or network communication. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard version declaration, common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or obfuscated elements.",
