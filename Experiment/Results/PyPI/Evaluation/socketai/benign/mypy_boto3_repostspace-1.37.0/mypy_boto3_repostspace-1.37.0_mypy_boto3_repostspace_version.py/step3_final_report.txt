  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without dynamic input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), but not malicious or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version string assignment with a comment and copyright notice. No dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious constructs are present. The only atypical aspect is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
