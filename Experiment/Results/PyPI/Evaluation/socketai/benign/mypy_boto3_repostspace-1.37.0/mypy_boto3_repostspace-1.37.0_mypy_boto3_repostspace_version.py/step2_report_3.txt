  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code is a minimal Python snippet:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\nIt contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and a static assignment of a version string.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any dynamic data handling, external inputs, network activity, or executable logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The version string is hardcoded and static.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and serves a standard purpose of declaring a version number.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Define version.  \n- Findings: No data flows, sinks, anomalies, or suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Define version string.  \n- Findings: Simple assignment, no external data or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Define version.  \n- Findings: Static assignment, no input/output or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Declare version.  \n- Findings: Only copyright comment and version assignment.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Version declaration.  \n- Findings: Static assignment, no data flow, no malicious behavior.  \n- Peculiarity: Future copyright year (2025).  \n- **Assessment:** Not suspicious or malicious; likely a typo or placeholder, but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code shows no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n**Scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.**\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The only slightly unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025).  \n- This does not imply malicious intent; it might be a placeholder or typo.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**  \n  Given the evidence, I agree with the assigned scores of 0 for all three.\n\n- **Potential Adjustments:**  \n  None necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward version declaration with no security risks, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the future copyright year is unusual, it does not impact security or indicate malicious intent. It should be corrected for clarity, but it doesn't warrant concern in the context of security analysis.",
