  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of a comment block, a copyright notice, and a static assignment of `__version__`.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, external data sources, data flows, or executable logic.\n   - No code obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0, aligning with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is 0, which is reasonable since the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, reflecting high certainty about benignity.\n   - The purpose and analysis sections are consistent and correctly interpret the code.\n\n3. **Notable Observations:**\n   - The only unusual aspect is the copyright year \"2025\" in report 5, which is in the future relative to current dates. While this might be a typo or intentional, it does not introduce any security concern.\n   - No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made that could be challenged.\n\n4. **Potential Improvements:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable; no adjustments are necessary.\n   - Since the code is trivial, the risk scores are appropriately low, and the malware score is correctly zero.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct, no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version declaration with no security issues. No modifications to scores are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
