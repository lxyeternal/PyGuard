  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package, serving as a source of truth for versioning information.",
  "sources": "The assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output occurs; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The source is the hardcoded version string; no flow to sinks as no external data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed; simple assignment with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a module-level variable __version__ to a static string '1.37.0'. There are no inputs, no external data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The comment indicates authorship and date, but does not influence execution. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic version assignment statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is benign and purely informational.",
