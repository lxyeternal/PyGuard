  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that assigns a static string to `__version__`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external data handling.\n- The code includes only comments and a version string assignment.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None. All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, benign, and standard for version declaration.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The code is purely declarative, with no dynamic or external inputs.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The future copyright date (2025) is unusual but not suspicious or malicious.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the assessment is based solely on the code's static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
