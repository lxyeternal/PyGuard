{
  "purpose": "Defines a version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the only source of data is the hardcoded version string '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future date (2025) might be unusual but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a module-level string assignment for '__version__' and a copyright comment. There are no dynamic data inputs, no external data processing, and no executable logic or network activity. The future copyright date is peculiar but not suspicious or malicious. Overall, the code is a simple version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious content. It does not exhibit any security risks or malicious intent.",
