  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic inputs, external data, or code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified in any report.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the descriptions: it's just a static string assignment with comments.\n- No issues are present in the code based on the reports.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The only noteworthy point is the future copyright year, which is not an error but an unusual detail.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The `confidence` is 1, justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external data, code execution, or suspicious constructs, a `securityRisk` score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The `malware` score of 0 is also correct, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is non-executable and static.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, which doesn't introduce risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on the review:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing assessments.",
