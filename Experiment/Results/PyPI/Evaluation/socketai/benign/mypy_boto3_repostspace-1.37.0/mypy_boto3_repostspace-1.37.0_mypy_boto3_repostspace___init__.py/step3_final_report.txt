{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface setup for the repostspace service SDK, including documentation, class imports, and exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes, sets an alias, and defines __all__. It contains a documentation string with usage instructions. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or data handling occurs. The code structure is standard for SDK interface modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python SDK interface module with no security issues or malicious intent. All assessments and scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
