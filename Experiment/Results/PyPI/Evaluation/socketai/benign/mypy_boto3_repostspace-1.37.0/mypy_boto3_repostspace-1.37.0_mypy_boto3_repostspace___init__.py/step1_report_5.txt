  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for interacting with the repostspace service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), reading module-level code and comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code mainly defines imports, variables, and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only straightforward import statements, documentation, and variable assignments; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports, documentation, and a simple variable assignment for the client. No dynamic code execution, external data reads, or potential malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a clean interface module without malicious intent.",
