  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a simple module that imports classes, sets an alias, and defines `__all__`. The documentation string provides usage instructions.\n   - No data is read or written, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward SDK interface setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security issues.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n   - No reason to assign higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's straightforward structure.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a typical, benign module setup for a Python SDK.\n- No hidden or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The documentation and structure are standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
