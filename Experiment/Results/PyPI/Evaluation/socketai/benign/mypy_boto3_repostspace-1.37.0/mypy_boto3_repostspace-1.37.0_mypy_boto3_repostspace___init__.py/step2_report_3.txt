  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure the scores and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup: imports, documentation, and exports.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code content.\n- The security risk is also consistently 0, which seems justified given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** Provides an interface for repostspace, no issues found.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent with the code. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard module setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final considerations:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 for all reports; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the code is benign and does not introduce security issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1, given the consistent analysis.\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, benign module setup for a Python SDK interface, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Final note:** Always keep monitoring for future updates, but based on the current code, it’s safe.",
