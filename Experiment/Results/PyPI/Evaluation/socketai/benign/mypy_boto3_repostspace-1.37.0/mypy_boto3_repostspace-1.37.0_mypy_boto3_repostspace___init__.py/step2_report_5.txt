  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference it with the code snippet.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple module that imports classes from local modules, sets an alias, and defines `__all__`.\n- The documentation string provides usage instructions.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, data handling, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** The code appears straightforward, with no vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard interface setup.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n### Justification for scores > 0.5:\n\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification is necessary.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n\n- The reports assume the code is purely an interface module without malicious intent, which is consistent with the code.\n\n### Consistency check:\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the code snippet and reports, my own evaluation aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard module setup with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports classes, sets an alias, and provides documentation.  \n- No issues, vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.  \n- The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, benign, and free of security risks.",
