  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:  \n   The code is a set of Python type definitions using TypedDict, designed to specify data schemas for the repostspace service API. It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, but no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Source and Sink Analysis**:  \n   - Sources: Imports from standard libraries and local modules; no untrusted input sources are evident.  \n   - Sinks: No data is processed or output; the code only defines static data structures.\n\n3. **Flow and Behavior**:  \n   - No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely static type annotations.  \n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling.\n\n4. **Anomalies and Suspicious Patterns**:  \n   - The code uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or code that could be malicious.  \n   - No dynamic code, eval, exec, or other potentially malicious constructs.\n\n5. **Analysis Summary**:  \n   - The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions intended for static type checking and documentation.  \n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.  \n   - No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n\n6. **Scores Justification**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: 0. The code is purely static type definitions with no malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.  \n   - **Risk Score**: 0. Since there are no security-sensitive operations or vulnerabilities, the overall risk is negligible.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe provided code is a standard, benign type definition module for a Python SDK, with no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
