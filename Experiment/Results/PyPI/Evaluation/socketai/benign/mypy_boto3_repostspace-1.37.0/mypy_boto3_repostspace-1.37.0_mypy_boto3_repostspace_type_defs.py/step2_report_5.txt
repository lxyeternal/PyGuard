  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that this code is a static set of type definitions for the repostspace API.\n- They consistently note the absence of dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n- The purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation.\n\n**Confirming the Code Content:**\n- The code only defines TypedDict classes with type annotations.\n- No runtime logic, data handling, or input/output operations are present.\n- Conditional imports are standard for cross-version compatibility.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or environment variable manipulations.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n- The assessments are consistent and well-justified.\n\n**Scores Given to Issues:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's static, non-executable nature.\n\n**Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all scores are 0, no justification needed.\n- The code poses no runtime risk or malicious threat.\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as purely structural.\n- No false positives or unwarranted concerns are present.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a benign, static type definition module.\n- No dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- No data leaks, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is entirely safe and should be considered low risk. The existing assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for API validation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.",
