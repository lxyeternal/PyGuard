  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the repostspace service API.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, sys.version_info checks, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data input/output points; purely type definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no runtime data flow; only static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of typed dictionary classes and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It does not contain executable logic, user input handling, network operations, or data leaks. No suspicious functions or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be a standard type definitions module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward type annotation module defining data structures for the repostspace service. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and purely for static typing purposes.",
