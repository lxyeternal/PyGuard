  "purpose": "Type definitions for repostspace service API data structures, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, and local modules; class attribute definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; purely type annotations and data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is a static type definition module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly defines data types for API communication.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and type hinting modules, conditionally based on Python version, to ensure compatibility. It defines TypedDict classes representing API request and response schemas. No runtime logic, user input processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. All type definitions are straightforward and adhere to standard practices. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The module functions solely as a static type schema for API payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions used for static type checking. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. Its purpose is to provide clear data structure schemas for the repostspace API interactions.",
