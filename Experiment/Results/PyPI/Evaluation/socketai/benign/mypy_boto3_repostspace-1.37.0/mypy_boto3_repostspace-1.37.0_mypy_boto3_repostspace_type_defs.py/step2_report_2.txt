  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the claims and scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a set of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic behavior.\n- The code appears to be a well-structured, standard approach to defining API data schemas.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for API, used for data validation.\n- **Analysis:** Confirms no runtime operations, data sinks, or data flows involving untrusted data.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely static type definitions.\n\n**Score justification:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, static type definitions.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic behavior, no data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Score justification:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, type definitions for API.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0 — consistent.\n\n**Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** API data structures, static type annotations.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0 — fitting.\n\n**Score justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions, no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, SecurityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Score justification:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type definitions with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The malware scores across all reports are 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are also 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct, no security risks)\n\n**Note:** Given the detailed analysis, I concur with the scores assigned in all reports. The code is benign, purely for static type checking, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary. The code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as a static type definition module.",
