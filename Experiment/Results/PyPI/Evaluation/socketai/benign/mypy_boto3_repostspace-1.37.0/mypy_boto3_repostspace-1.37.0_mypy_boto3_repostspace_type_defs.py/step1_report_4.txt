  "purpose": "Type definitions for repostspace service API request and response structures to ensure type safety and documentation clarity.",
  "sources": "Static type annotations, import statements, and constant definitions; no runtime input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or data sinks involving untrusted input or external systems; primarily data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or data manipulations; definitions are static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The code strictly defines data structures and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, class definitions, and imports aimed at providing type safety for a Python API client. It adapts imports based on Python version, but there is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network communication. No anomalies, malicious code, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears standard for a typed Python module providing API request/response schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe set of type definitions for a service API. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It contains no obfuscated code or malicious data handling.",
