{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for the repostspace service API, used for data validation and typing in Python.",
  "sources": "The code defines class-based TypedDict structures and imports data from external modules. It does not read untrusted input or perform data processing.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent data sinks or output functions that process untrusted data. The code primarily defines static type structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as the code is solely type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution detected. No network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of TypedDict class definitions used for static type checking. It includes imports, class definitions with typed attributes, and conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. No dynamic behavior, no input/output handling, no execution logic, and no security-sensitive operations are evident. The purpose is purely data structure definitions for API interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type definitions intended for static type validation in a Python project. It does not perform any runtime operations, input/output, or data manipulation that could pose security risks or malware threats.",
