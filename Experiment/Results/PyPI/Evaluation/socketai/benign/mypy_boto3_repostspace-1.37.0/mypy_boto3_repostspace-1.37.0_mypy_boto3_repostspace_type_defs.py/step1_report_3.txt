{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for repostspace service API interactions, mainly used for type hinting and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, type extension modules, and internal literals; class definitions that specify data schemas.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data input handling; no network communication, file access, or command execution; no sensitive data processing or storage.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only defines data types, not executable logic or data flow mechanisms.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports for compatibility, but no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely type definition for a Python SDK, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or code execution. It uses standard practices for typing, including conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The structure and content suggest it is a standard, well-structured type definition module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign type definition module used for API data schemas. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
