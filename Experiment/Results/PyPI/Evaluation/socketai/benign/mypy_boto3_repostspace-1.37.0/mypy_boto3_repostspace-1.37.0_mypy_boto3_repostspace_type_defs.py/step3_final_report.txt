  "purpose": "Type definitions for repostspace service API data schemas, serving static type validation and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries and local modules for type annotations; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output; purely static type definitions with no data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports for compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static TypedDict class definitions for API data structures, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation, making it inherently benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, non-executable module intended for type validation.",
