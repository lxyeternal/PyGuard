  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, the reasonableness of the scores, and any logical inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a type-safe SDK interface for AWS re:Post Private, with no malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation. It primarily defines method signatures, exceptions, and type annotations.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is purely interface/type definitions.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No obfuscation present; code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n  *Justification:* Very low, standard SDK interface.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scoring aligns well with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK patterns, no suspicious code, and safe interface definitions.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious activity or code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n  *Justification:* Low, as expected.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard boto3 client stub with method signatures and type annotations. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* Clear code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* Slightly higher than previous reports, possibly due to mentioning URL generation and untrusted input. However, in the context of SDK stubs, this is normal behavior.\n\n**Note:** Generating presigned URLs inherently involves URL creation based on input parameters, which could be exploited if misused, but this is standard AWS SDK behavior and not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard SDK interface, no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n  *Justification:* Low, consistent with other reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: standard, well-structured SDK interface, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No signs of malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* Clear code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1  \n  *Justification:* Very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly varying between 0.1 and 0.2, which is reasonable given the context of SDK interface code that interacts with potentially untrusted input but does not itself contain malicious logic.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-typed AWS SDK interface stub with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard SDK interface)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided reports.",
