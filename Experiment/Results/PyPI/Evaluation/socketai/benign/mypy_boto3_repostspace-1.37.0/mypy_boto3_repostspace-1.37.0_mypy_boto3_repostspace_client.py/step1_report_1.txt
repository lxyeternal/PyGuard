{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python client interface for interacting with the AWS re:Post Private service, providing type annotations, method signatures, and exception handling for the SDK.",
  "sources": "The code sources include standard library modules (sys, typing), third-party libraries (botocore, typing_extensions), and internal modules (.paginator, .type_defs). Data input sources are through method parameters, notably via **kwargs, which are unpacked into specific type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve the methods that send data over network or modify resources, such as generate_presigned_url, batch_add_role, batch_remove_role, create_space, delete_space, deregister_admin, get_space, list_spaces, list_tags_for_resource, register_admin, send_invites, tag_resource, untag_resource, update_space. These are places where untrusted or manipulated data could be used maliciously if supplied by an attacker.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method parameters (via **kwargs) into internal processing within the SDK, potentially passing untrusted data into network calls or resource modifications. For example, untrusted input could reach generate_presigned_url (URL generation), or resource-modifying methods (create_space, update_space). Method calls like list_spaces or get_paginator involve data retrieval, generally not a security concern unless data is misused.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard AWS SDK patterns; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution are evident. The use of **kwargs with type definitions is typical for SDK interfaces. No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious control flow is present. No anomalous external calls or hidden data leaks are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured, well-typed interface for AWS re:Post Private service. It relies on external modules for actual implementation, with method signatures aligned to AWS SDK conventions. The code itself contains no malicious logic; it acts as a type-safe wrapper for SDK operations. The data flow is controlled via method parameters, and no unsafe operations, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The presence of exception definitions and method signatures suggests a standard, safe SDK pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate SDK interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a typical client stub for AWS service interaction, emphasizing type annotations and method signatures. The overall security risk is very low, and no malicious intent is evident.",
