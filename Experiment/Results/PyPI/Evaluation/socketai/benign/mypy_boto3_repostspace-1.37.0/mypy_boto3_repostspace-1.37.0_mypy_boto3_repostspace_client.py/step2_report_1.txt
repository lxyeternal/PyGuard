  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: actual code content, potential security concerns, anomalies, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a type-annotated client interface for AWS re:Post Private, with no suspicious logic or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is purely a stub/interface with no executable logic, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the absence of actual implementation or data handling. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a type stub with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is just interface definitions with no actual logic. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. No anomalies or suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights potential sinks such as `generate_presigned_url`, resource tagging, and untrusted inputs, but notes these are standard SDK behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nWhile it points out potential misuse points, the code itself does not implement any malicious logic. These functions are standard SDK methods that, if misused, could be exploited, but in this stub, there's no actual data or code execution. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing standard SDK patterns, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo signs of malicious activity. The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the standard, non-malicious nature of the code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected in any report. All are type stub/interface definitions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All zero, which aligns with the actual code content.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code is purely declarative with no executable logic or data manipulation.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-typed SDK interface for AWS re:Post Private, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The potential sinks identified are typical for SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to the potential for misuse if someone supplies malicious input, but the code itself is safe)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is a standard, safe SDK interface stub with no malware or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the potential for misuse if misused, but the code itself is benign.",
