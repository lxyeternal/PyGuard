  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS re:Post Private SDK client, providing method signatures and exception types.",
  "sources": "Method parameters via **kwargs, internal type definitions, imported libraries (botocore, typing, internal modules).",
  "sinks": "Methods like generate_presigned_url, batch_add_role, create_space, delete_space, register_admin, send_invites, tag_resource, untag_resource, update_space, which involve network calls, resource modifications, or URL generation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK methods, potentially reaching network or resource management functions; no actual data processing or untrusted data handling beyond standard SDK patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected; code is purely declarative interface.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-typed SDK interface stub for AWS re:Post Private, with no executable logic or embedded malicious code. Potential sinks such as URL generation and resource modification are typical SDK features that could be misused if supplied malicious inputs, but the code itself does not contain any malicious activity. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The confidence scores are high, given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score correctly indicates no malicious activity.",
