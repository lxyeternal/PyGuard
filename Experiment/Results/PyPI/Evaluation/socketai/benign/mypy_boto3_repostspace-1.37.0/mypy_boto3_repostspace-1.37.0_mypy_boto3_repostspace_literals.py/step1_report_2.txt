  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS-related string constants used in the repostspace service library.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data output, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward type alias definitions. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system information to conditionally import Literal from typing or typing_extensions. It defines various string literal types for use elsewhere in the application. The large list of AWS resource names and service names are static literals, serving as type hints. No runtime data handling, no user input processing, no network activity, and no code injection or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static type definition file with no signs of malicious intent. It simply declares string literals for type safety in a larger project. No security issues detected.",
