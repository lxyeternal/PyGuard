  "purpose": "Defines type literals for the repostspace service and related AWS service names for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward type definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains static type alias definitions for string literals, which serve as type annotations. It conditionally imports the Literal type based on Python version, ensuring compatibility. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external data handling. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The code includes a license and documentation comment, and the structure is standard for type stub definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type aliases for documentation and type checking purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform any data processing or external interactions.",
