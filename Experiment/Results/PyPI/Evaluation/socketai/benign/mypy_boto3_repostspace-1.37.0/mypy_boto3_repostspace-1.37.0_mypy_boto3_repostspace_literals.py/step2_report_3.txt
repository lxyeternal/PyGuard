  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, consistency, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines static type aliases for AWS resource and service names, with no dynamic behavior or external interactions.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious code, purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.5 (or lower). The report suggests no security concern.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code is static, defining string literals for AWS services/resources with no runtime behavior.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, static definitions of AWS resource and service names, with compatibility handling for Python versions.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type alias definitions for AWS services, no dynamic code.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static type aliases for AWS resource and service names, straightforward.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. The code is purely static type definitions with no runtime or external interactions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. The code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 or lower. Since the code is static, documentation, and type annotations, the security risk is negligible.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there are no security concerns.\n\nThis supply chain component appears entirely benign, serving as a type definitions module for AWS resource names. No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risk are present.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
