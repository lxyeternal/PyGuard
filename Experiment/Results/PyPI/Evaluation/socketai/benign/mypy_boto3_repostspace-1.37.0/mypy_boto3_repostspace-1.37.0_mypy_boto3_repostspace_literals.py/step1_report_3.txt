{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS service and resource names related to the repostspace service, used for type annotations in Python code.",
  "sources": "Literal definitions for string-based types, imported 'sys' to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or data flows present. No network, file, or environment variable interactions identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants and type annotations without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code constructs. All definitions are static, straightforward, and documented. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up string literal types for use in type hinting with mypy or similar tools. It includes a version check for importing 'Literal' for compatibility across Python versions. The literal types cover a comprehensive list of AWS services and resource types. The code is purely declarative, with no runtime behavior or external data interactions. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or supply chain attack mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition module used for type annotations, with no malicious intent or security risks present. It is well-structured, static, and documented, serving as a type hinting aid without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
