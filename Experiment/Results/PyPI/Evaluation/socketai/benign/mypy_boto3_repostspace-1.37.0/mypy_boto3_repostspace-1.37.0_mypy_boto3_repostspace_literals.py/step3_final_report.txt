  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS resource and service name literals, used for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, string literal definitions for various AWS resource and service names.",
  "sinks": "None; the code is purely static with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Static definitions; no runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string literal types for AWS services and resources, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external data handling. The structure is clear, well-documented, and serves solely for type hinting and documentation purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static module for AWS resource name type annotations. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with its content.",
