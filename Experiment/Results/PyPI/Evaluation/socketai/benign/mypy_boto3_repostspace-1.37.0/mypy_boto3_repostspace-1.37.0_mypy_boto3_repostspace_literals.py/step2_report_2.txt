  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the claims are justified, whether the code contains any security risks, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS resource and service names, primarily for type checking and documentation.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, ensuring compatibility.\n- There are no dynamic operations, data processing, user input, network activity, or external data handling.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code segments are present.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a type hinting aid.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define type literals for repostspace service and AWS resource names.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identified as static, benign, and purely for type annotations. No malicious activity or security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining AWS-related string literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the static, non-malicious nature. No external data or dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define AWS service/resource name literals for type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identified as static, with no malicious intent or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** String literal types for AWS services, for static type checking.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No runtime data handling or malicious behavior. The code is purely static.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Type literals for repostspace and AWS resource names.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identified as static, documentation-oriented, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification**\n\n- All reports correctly assess that the code is static, benign, and intended solely for type hinting.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk all zero) are justified.\n\n### **Additional Considerations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment**\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, static type definition module with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and correctly characterized in all reports.",
