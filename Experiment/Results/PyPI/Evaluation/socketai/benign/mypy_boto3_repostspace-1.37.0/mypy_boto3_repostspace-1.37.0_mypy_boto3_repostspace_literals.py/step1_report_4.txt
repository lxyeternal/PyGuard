{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for boto3 repostspace service and related AWS service identifiers with type annotations for static type checking.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from type annotations and string literals defined directly within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code solely declares static types and constants without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code uses standard type annotations and conditional import based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of string literal types for various AWS service names and identifiers, including conditional imports for 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. There are no functions, dynamic execution, data handling, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present; all elements are static type definitions meant for type safety and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign module solely for type annotations and constants, with no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no suspicious code segments. It is designed for static type checking support in AWS SDK interactions.",
