{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for the repostspace service and related AWS resource and operation names for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code sources include import statements (sys and typing) and the assignment of string literals to type alias variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform output operations. The code is solely defining constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import sys and typing, conditionally import Literal, then define type aliases as string literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The code only consists of type alias definitions and import statements. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by importing sys and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version, ensuring compatibility. It then defines a series of string literal type aliases used for AWS resource and service identification. The entire code is static, simple, and intended for type hinting purposes. No data processing, user input handling, or external interactions are present. The code is well-structured, readable, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, serving as a type definitions module for AWS service literals. It contains no malicious behavior, no hidden functionality, and poses no security risk. It is safe to use and has no security concerns.",
