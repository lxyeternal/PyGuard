  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code only outputs static package information.",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs static package info or version info to stdout. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data handling, and no network activity or suspicious logic. The functions are straightforward, performing simple string outputs. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. The code's purpose is solely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package details. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present in this code snippet.",
