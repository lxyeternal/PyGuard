  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It's a minimal CLI script.\n- It outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- No dynamic code, no external calls, no obfuscation.\n- No credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the described behavior. It correctly checks for `--version` and outputs static info. No issues are present in the implementation.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All reports agree that the code is benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0 or very close to 0.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**\n- All describe the code as a benign CLI utility that outputs static info.\n- They consistently assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0 (or 0.1 in report 5, but still very low)\n- Their reasoning is sound, based on the code's simplicity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), but given the code's simplicity, this seems an overestimation.\n- No external calls or dynamic behaviors that could pose a risk.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The securityRisk score of 0.1 in report 5 might be marginally high, but given the code's benign nature, it should be 0.\n\n- **Any logical flaws?**  \n  No. All analyses are consistent with the code.\n\n- **Any assumptions challenged?**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info and version. All reports are consistent and accurate. The scores should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider context—if the code were part of a larger, dynamically loaded system, risks might differ. But based solely on this snippet, it's safe.",
