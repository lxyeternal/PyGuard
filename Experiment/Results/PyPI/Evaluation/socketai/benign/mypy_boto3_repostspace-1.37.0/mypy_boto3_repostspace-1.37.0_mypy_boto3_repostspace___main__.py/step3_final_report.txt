  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), outputs static strings via `sys.stdout.write`.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leading to version output; otherwise, static info output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version. It performs a simple argument check and writes static strings to stdout. No external calls, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is benign. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report overestimates the minimal residual concern; a score of 0 is more accurate given the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The minimal security risk score should be adjusted to 0 for maximum precision. Overall, the code poses no supply chain security risk.",
