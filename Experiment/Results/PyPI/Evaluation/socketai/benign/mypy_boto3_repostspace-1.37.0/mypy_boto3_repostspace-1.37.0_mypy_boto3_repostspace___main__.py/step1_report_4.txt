  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs data to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to sys.stdout based on input command.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() and outputs version; otherwise calls print_info() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that outputs package information or version details based on command-line arguments. It reads input from sys.argv, which is standard, and writes output to sys.stdout. The functions are straightforward with no suspicious logic or external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or hidden backdoors. The code is clean, minimal, and focused solely on informational output.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign CLI utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves to provide package info and version details. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
