  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a minimal CLI utility that displays static package info or version.\n- It uses `sys.argv` to check for `--version`.\n- It outputs static strings via `sys.stdout.write`.\n- No dynamic code, external network calls, or obfuscation.\n- No credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.\n- The reports correctly identify that the script is benign, straightforward, and purely informational.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is safe.\n- No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1, but given the code's simplicity, a score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n**Note on report #5:** It assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, which seems slightly high given the code's benign nature. Since there's no dynamic code, no external dependencies, and no suspicious patterns, **0.0** is more appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malware or vulnerabilities justifies a high risk score.\n- The code is trivial and safe.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed as 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, my own estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility for displaying static package info and version, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate, though the securityRisk could be lowered to 0.0 in report #5.\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and the scoring reflects that.",
