{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv); outputs data to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "If '--version' argument is present, reads from sys.argv and outputs version info; otherwise, outputs package info. Data flows are limited to command-line input and stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears straightforward with standard functions.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for a specific command-line argument '--version'. If present, it prints the package version; if not, it prints detailed package info. All data reads are from sys.argv and output is written to stdout. No user input beyond command-line args, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI interface providing package information and version. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present based on this code. It functions as expected for a CLI tool.",
