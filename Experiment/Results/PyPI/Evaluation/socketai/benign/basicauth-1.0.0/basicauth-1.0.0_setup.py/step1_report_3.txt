  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package providing a basic HTTP authentication implementation.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from the setup() arguments and reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None in the provided code; no untrusted data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input from environment (file system read of 'README.md') into package metadata; no other data flow paths present.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard setup operations with no unusual or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no code execution, and no network activity. The license 'UNLICENSE' is non-standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses setuptools.setup() with typical package metadata. It reads a 'README.md' file for the long description, which is standard. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations, no hardcoded secrets, and no indication of malicious behavior. The code appears straightforward and aligned with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package configuration without any suspicious activity.",
