  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no execution of untrusted code, network connections, or credential handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading the 'README.md' file content as part of the long_description parameter during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of open() to read 'README.md' is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup with standard metadata and imports necessary modules for path handling and packaging. It reads the long description from a file, which is typical in setup scripts. No code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior detected. All code is straightforward and adheres to common setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads package metadata and description from files, which is standard. No malicious intent or malicious code structures identified.",
