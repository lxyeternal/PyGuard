  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code reads 'README.md' without error handling, but this is common practice.\n- The license field 'UNLICENSE' is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with their findings.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports only standard modules (`os.path` and `setuptools`) and performs straightforward setup configuration.\n- The 'long_description' is read directly from a local file without error handling, but this is typical in setup scripts.\n- No suspicious logic, such as code that could be malicious or that processes untrusted input, is present.\n- The package metadata is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The only minor concern is the lack of error handling when reading 'README.md', but this does not imply malicious intent.\n- The license 'UNLICENSE' is non-standard but not malicious; it might warrant clarification but does not affect security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security risks or malicious behavior.",
