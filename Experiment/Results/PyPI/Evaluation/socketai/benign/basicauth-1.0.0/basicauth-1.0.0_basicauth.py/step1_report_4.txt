{
  "purpose": "Provide basic HTTP authentication encoding and decoding functions for use in web applications.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'encoded_str' parameter in the decode() function, and username/password arguments in the encode() function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data itself; it only processes and returns encoded/decoded strings. No untrusted data is directly used in critical system functions or network operations within this code.",
  "flows": "User supplies username/password for encoding, which are then base64-encoded. For decoding, an input string is split, validated, and decoded into username and password. No external data sources or sinks are explicitly invoked in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains minimal anomalies; it raises exceptions for invalid input, but no unusual or suspicious logic is present. No hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The encode() function encodes username and password into a base64 string following HTTP Basic Auth standards, raising an exception if the username contains a colon. The decode() function carefully checks the input format, decodes the base64 string, and extracts username and password, raising errors if the input format is invalid. The code uses standard libraries and conventions, with proper validation and error handling. No indications of malicious intent, hardcoded credentials, or unsafe operations are present. The code appears to serve straightforward encoding/decoding purposes without external network calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard HTTP Basic Authentication encoding and decoding mechanism with appropriate validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for encoding and decoding credentials.",
