  "purpose": "Implementation of HTTP Basic Authentication encoding and decoding functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to encode() and decode() functions, data from encoded HTTP headers.",
  "sinks": "b64decode() and b64encode() functions handling encoded data, potential points of decoding or encoding data from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input from user-provided username/password or encoded string -> encoding/decoding via base64 -> output or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data leaks, no obfuscated code or hidden behavior. The code performs standard encoding/decoding operations without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward HTTP Basic Auth mechanism with proper exception handling. encode() encodes username and password after URL quoting, then base64 encodes the combined string. decode() handles various header formats, decodes base64, and splits username/password, unquoting them. No suspicious or malicious operations, no network access, no data exfiltration, and no backdoors. It operates solely on input data with standard library functions. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility module for authentication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Basic HTTP authentication encoding/decoding functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates purely on input data, and the logic is straightforward and typical for such functionality.",
