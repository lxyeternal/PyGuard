{
  "purpose": "Implement basic HTTP authentication encoding and decoding for use in HTTP headers.",
  "sources": "User-provided username and password inputs, encoded via the encode() function; encoded authentication string passed to the decode() function.",
  "sinks": "The decode() function decodes base64-encoded strings which could be crafted or malicious; however, there are no network or system calls that send or receive data in this code.",
  "flows": "User inputs (username, password) -> encode() encodes and returns a string -> decode() decodes the string back into username and password.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. Exception handling raises custom exceptions but does not perform side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple functions to encode and decode HTTP Basic Auth strings. encode() safely encodes username and password, applying URL quoting and base64 encoding, with a check to prevent colons in usernames. decode() handles base64 decoding with input validation, parsing the string format, and raising errors if the input does not match expected patterns. There are no network operations, file access, or external system interactions. The code appears to be straightforward, with no suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It is primarily a utility for encoding/decoding authentication headers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of HTTP Basic Authentication encoding/decoding without any malicious intent or malicious behavior. It includes proper error handling and input validation. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
