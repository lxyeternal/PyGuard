  "purpose": "Provide functions to encode and decode HTTP Basic Authentication headers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'username', 'password', and 'encoded_str' in the functions encode() and decode().",
  "sinks": "b64encode() and b64decode() functions process encoded data; unquote() and quote() handle URL encoding/decoding.",
  "flows": "encode() takes username and password, encodes with base64 after URL encoding; decode() reverses process, decoding base64 and URL-encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code patterns. Exception handling is broad but standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard methods for encoding and decoding HTTP Basic Authentication headers. encode() URL-encodes username and password, then base64-encodes the result, prepending 'Basic'. decode() reverses this process, handling different header formats and errors appropriately. No external network calls, no data leaks, no suspicious code flows or hardcoded secrets. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The functions are straightforward and implement standard authentication header processing, with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of HTTP Basic Authentication encoding and decoding without malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It performs safe data encoding/decoding as intended.",
