{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to encode and decode HTTP Basic Authentication headers, facilitating the handling of username and password data in a standard manner.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'username', 'password', and 'encoded_str'.",
  "sinks": "The code processes untrusted input strings during decoding, which could lead to errors if malformed, but does not directly leak data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are URL-quoted and base64-encoded in 'encode()'; in 'decode()', the encoded string is base64-decoded and split to retrieve username and password, with unquoting applied.",
  "anomalies": "The exception handling in 'decode()' uses broad 'except:' clauses, which could be refined, but does not introduce security issues. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard HTTP Basic Auth encoding and decoding with proper validation and error handling. It does not perform network operations, file access, or obfuscation. The broad exception handling is typical but could be more specific. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The input validation ensures that malformed data is handled gracefully. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of HTTP Basic Authentication processing. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
