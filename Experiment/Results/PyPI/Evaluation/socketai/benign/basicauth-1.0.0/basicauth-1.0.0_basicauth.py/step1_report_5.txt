  "purpose": "Implement HTTP Basic Authentication encoding and decoding functions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are user-supplied username and password in encode(), and the encoded string in decode().",
  "sinks": "Potentially decoding untrusted encoded strings in decode() which may lead to processing malicious or malformed data.",
  "flows": "encode() takes username and password, encodes and outputs a string; decode() takes the encoded string, verifies and decodes it back into username and password.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of try-except blocks to handle decoding errors, which is standard. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code present. The implementation is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic functions for encoding and decoding HTTP Basic Auth headers using base64. The encode() function ensures no colon in username and encodes username and password with URL quoting. The decode() function handles two main formats: raw base64 string or 'Basic' prefix, decoding accordingly and unquoting. Error handling is implemented to catch malformed inputs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data processing. No dangerous external calls, network operations, or secret exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Basic Auth encoding/decoding without any malicious intent. It does not exhibit suspicious or malicious behavior, nor does it contain malware or obfuscated code. It appears safe for use within its intended scope.",
