  "purpose": "This code manages configuration options for a formatter, including merging, validation, and normalization of options.",
  "sources": "Options passed during instantiation, particularly in the _mergeOpts function and attribute access within the Options class.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or system calls; data remains within in-memory structures.",
  "flows": "Options are merged and validated internally; no external data flows or malicious data handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing configuration options, involving merging dictionaries, normalizing keys, and validating values. All functions perform safe, typical operations without external system interaction or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is well-structured, clear, and adheres to common practices for options management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward options management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use in production environments, and the scores should reflect its benign nature.",
