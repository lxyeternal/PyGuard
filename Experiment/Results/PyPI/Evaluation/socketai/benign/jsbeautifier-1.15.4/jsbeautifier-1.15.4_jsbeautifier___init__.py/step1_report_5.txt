{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python script for a JavaScript beautifier CLI tool, allowing users to format JavaScript code with various options.",
  "sources": "Input sources include files specified via command-line arguments or stdin when the '--stdin' flag is used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include reading files, processing input data, and outputting the beautified code to stdout or specified files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files or stdin) through the beautify process and then to output destinations (stdout or files).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code patterns are present. The code relies on standard libraries and external jsbeautifier modules without unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and external modules to parse command-line options, handle files, and perform JavaScript beautification. It defines functions for default options, beautifying strings and files, displaying usage, and the main CLI logic. The main function processes command-line arguments, configures options, reads input files or stdin, beautifies the code, and writes output to files or stdout. No embedded network calls, system modifications, or dynamic code execution mechanisms are present. The code follows typical CLI tool patterns without suspicious constructs or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for JavaScript beautification with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It safely processes input and outputs formatted code, using external modules responsibly. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
