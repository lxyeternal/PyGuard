  "purpose": "The script is a command-line tool and module for beautifying JavaScript code, providing options for formatting, indentation, and output handling.",
  "sources": "Input can come from command-line arguments, specified files, or stdin (standard input stream).",
  "sinks": "Output can be written to stdout, specified output files, or in-place replacement of input files.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from stdin or files through the beautify process, then to the specified output stream or file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code mainly handles file input/output and configuration; no obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports standard libraries and the jsbeautifier module, then defines functions for options, usage, and main execution logic. It provides a command-line interface for beautifying JavaScript code, with various configurable options. No code segments perform network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Error handling is standard, and all actions are related to formatting and file operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, code injection, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate JavaScript beautifier tool with no indication of malicious intent. It reads input, processes it, and outputs formatted code without engaging in any suspicious or harmful activity. The code appears safe and purely focused on formatting functionality.",
