  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a CLI wrapper for a beautifier, reading from command-line args or stdin.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes output and data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the 'eval_code' option as a potential concern, but it is not used in this code.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code only wraps around the beautifier library, with no embedded malicious code or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with a minor concern about 'eval_code' being present as an option but not used.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No malware or suspicious behavior detected. The 'eval_code' option's presence is a minor potential risk if enabled, but since it is not invoked here, it doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code detected.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the script as a standard CLI wrapper, with no malicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malware or supply chain issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identified.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the script as a straightforward CLI wrapper with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility, safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no malware or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the code as a standard CLI tool with no malicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and benign.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the script as a typical CLI utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; the only minor concern is the presence of the 'eval_code' option, which is not used here. If enabled, it could pose a risk, but as the code stands, it is harmless.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around a known open-source beautifier library.\n- No malicious code, network activity, or supply chain issues are evident.\n- The 'eval_code' option should be documented clearly as a potential security concern if enabled, but it is not active in this code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**     | **0**             | No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior present.                      |\n| **Obfuscated**  | **0**             | Code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.                                         |\n| **Risk**        | **0.1**           | Very low; presence of 'eval_code' option is noted but not used. It could be a concern if enabled. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with negligible security risk under current usage. The presence of 'eval_code' is a potential vector if misused, but in this context, it does not pose a threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed unless 'eval_code' is enabled or the code is modified to include dynamic code execution.",
