  "purpose": "A command-line interface wrapper for a JavaScript beautifier library, enabling users to format JS code with various options.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, input files, stdin",
  "sinks": "Output files, stdout",
  "flows": "Reads input from files or stdin, processes with beautifier, writes to output files or stdout",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'eval_code' option which could be risky if enabled, but is not invoked in this code",
  "analysis": "The script primarily parses command-line options, sets configuration, and invokes the beautifier. No embedded malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. The 'eval_code' option exists but is not used, posing no immediate threat. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility for JavaScript beautification, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The only minor concern is the 'eval_code' option, which remains inactive. Overall, it is safe for use.",
