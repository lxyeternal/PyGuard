  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a CLI wrapper for a JS beautifier, with an 'eval_code' option that could pose a risk if enabled. However, in this code, 'eval_code' is not invoked or used.\n- **Findings:** No embedded malicious code, no network activity, no backdoors. The 'eval_code' option is present but not utilized.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1 (due to potential if 'eval_code' is enabled). The overall assessment is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The presence of 'eval_code' as an option is a minor concern but not an active threat here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, a CLI for JS beautification, no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious patterns, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, straightforward code formatting utility.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, a CLI for beautifying JS code, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no network, no embedded backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a CLI wrapper with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no network activity, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No embedded malicious code, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected. All reports correctly identify that the script is a CLI wrapper around a well-known open-source beautifier library.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; only the 'eval_code' option exists as a potential concern, but it is not used or invoked in this script.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. The malware scores should be **0** for all reports.\n- The 'obfuscated' score should be **0**.\n- The 'securityRisk' score can remain very low (around 0.1), mainly due to the presence of the 'eval_code' option, which is not used here.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to 'eval_code' option being potentially dangerous if enabled)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard CLI wrapper for a JavaScript beautifier library. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present or implied by the code.",
