{
  "purpose": "This script is a command-line interface for a JavaScript beautifier, allowing users to format and reformat JavaScript code with various options.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include files specified in command-line arguments or standard input (stdin).",
  "sinks": "Output data is written either to specified files, replaced in-place, or to standard output. No untrusted data is directly sent over the network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-specified files or stdin through the beautify functions, with options modifying the input/output behavior, and results are written to files or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code primarily handles file I/O, command-line argument parsing, and calls to the jsbeautifier library functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated sections are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard CLI wrapper around the jsbeautifier library, handling options parsing, file input/output, and calling beautify functions. The code manages inputs and outputs securely, with no indications of malicious behavior. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. It relies on external libraries (jsbeautifier) which are well-known and open source, and no malicious code snippets are included or embedded. The only concern might be evaluation of code with the '--eval-code' option, but this is controlled by user input and not executed within this script itself. Overall, the script functions as intended for code formatting purposes and does not exhibit malware characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate command-line utility for JavaScript beautification, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It handles input and output securely and relies on external, open-source libraries with no embedded malicious code.",
