  "purpose": "The script is designed to beautify JavaScript code files or input streams, providing command-line options for formatting and configuration.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from files specified via command-line arguments, or from stdin if specified.",
  "sinks": "Output is written either to a specified file, in-place to the input file, or to stdout.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files or stdin) through the beautification process and then to output files or streams.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code mainly performs file I/O and data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a specific JavaScript beautifier library. It provides functions to set default options, perform beautification, handle command-line arguments, and manage file I/O. The options include typical formatting parameters, with no indication of malicious features such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code handles errors gracefully without any suspicious exception handling. The overall logic is straightforward, focusing solely on code formatting, with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign command-line utility for formatting JavaScript code. No evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or malware was found. The code does not perform any harmful operations or data leaks. Its purpose aligns with legitimate code beautification, and no suspicious anomalies are present.",
