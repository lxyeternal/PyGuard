  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script is a CLI wrapper for a JS beautifier, reading from files or stdin.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Writes output to files or stdout; data flows straightforwardly.\n- **Anomalies:** The only potential concern is the 'eval_code' option, which is not used here.\n- **Analysis:** No embedded malicious code, no network activity, no backdoors. The 'eval_code' option is a user-controlled feature but not invoked.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, standard CLI utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The 'eval_code' option, while a potential risk, is not used here. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the script, with no suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The script is a standard formatter, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Reiterates the benign nature, with no suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (again very low).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion: a legitimate CLI utility, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar analysis, no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the script functions as a command-line wrapper for a known open-source beautifier library.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** The only potential concern is the 'eval_code' option, which is not used in the provided code. If enabled, it could pose a risk, but in this context, it remains inactive.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low risk scores, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no active security threat; the 'eval_code' option is present but not used)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard CLI wrapper for a JavaScript beautifier library. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The minor presence of an 'eval_code' option is a standard feature that, if misused, could pose risks, but in this code, it remains inactive.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current low scores; the code is safe.",
