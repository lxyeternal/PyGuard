  "purpose": "The code is an empty file with no executable content, data, or instructions.",
  "sources": "No sources; the file contains no code or data to read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; since there is no code, no data flows, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; the file is empty, so no data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the file contains nothing, so no unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The file is completely empty, containing no code, data, or executable instructions. As a result, there are no potential sources of untrusted input, no data flows, and no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The absence of code means there are no security risks, malware, or malicious behavior possible. The reports correctly identify the file's emptiness and assign scores reflecting no malicious activity or security concerns. The confidence in this assessment is high, and the scores are consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The file is genuinely empty, with no code or data present. All reports are accurate and consistent, correctly concluding that there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate, with full confidence. No further action or analysis is necessary.",
