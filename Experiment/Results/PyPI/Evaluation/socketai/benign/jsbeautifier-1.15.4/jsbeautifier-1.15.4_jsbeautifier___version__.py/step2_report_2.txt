  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the codebase:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external communications involved.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a minimal, standard practice for package version declaration, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is only a straightforward version string assignment, there's no basis for increasing the risk score. The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware assessment:**  \n   No malware behavior is detected or claimed. The code does not attempt to execute code, read external data, or perform any suspicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the simplicity and standard nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would concur with the current evaluations. The minimal nature of this code precludes any malicious or obfuscated activity, and the security risk is negligible.",
