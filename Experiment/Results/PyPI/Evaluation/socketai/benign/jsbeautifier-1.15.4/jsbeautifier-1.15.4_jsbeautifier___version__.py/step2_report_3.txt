  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only assigns a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external communications. This is a standard practice in Python packages and does not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the simplicity of the code. No logical errors or suspicious patterns are identified. The reasoning that this is a straightforward version declaration is sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of any security concerns in such minimal code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is just a version string assignment, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The reports correctly assign 0, and I agree with this assessment.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. There is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis. The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a simple assignment of a version string, a common and benign practice. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present, and the risk is negligible. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
