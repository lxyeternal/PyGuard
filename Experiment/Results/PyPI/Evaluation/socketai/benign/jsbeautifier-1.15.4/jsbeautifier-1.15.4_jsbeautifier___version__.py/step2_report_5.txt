  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simply assigning a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors observed.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and standard practice for Python packages, with no malicious indicators.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores as 0, and the code is just a straightforward version string assignment, this is justified.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious activity or security concern.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the described code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code snippet is a typical, harmless version declaration.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this code.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No changes are necessary.",
