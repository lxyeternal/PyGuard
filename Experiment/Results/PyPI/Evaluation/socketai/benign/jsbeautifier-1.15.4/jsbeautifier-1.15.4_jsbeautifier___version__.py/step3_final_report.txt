  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "None; static assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external communication.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard practice with no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. No inputs, outputs, data flows, or external communications are present. The code is minimal, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All signals and reports are consistent, and no further action is necessary.",
