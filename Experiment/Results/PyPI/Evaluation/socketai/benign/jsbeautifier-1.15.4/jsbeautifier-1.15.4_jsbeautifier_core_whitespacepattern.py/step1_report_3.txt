{
  "purpose": "Define a class for handling whitespace patterns and processing whitespace in input text streams.",
  "sources": "Input stream accessed via self._input.read() and self._input.get_regexp() methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Input stream provides data -> pattern matching and splitting functions process data -> internal state updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no external network or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Pattern, focusing on whitespace handling. It reads input, constructs regex patterns, and maintains internal counters. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of regex and pattern matching is standard and appropriate. No data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification code observed. The class seems to serve a legitimate purpose within a parser or tokenizer context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign component for whitespace pattern processing with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions as part of a pattern matching library, with standard practices and no signs of supply chain attacks.",
