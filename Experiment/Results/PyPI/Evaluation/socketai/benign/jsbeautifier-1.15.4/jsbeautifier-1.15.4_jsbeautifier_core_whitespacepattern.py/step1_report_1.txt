{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for handling whitespace patterns in an input stream, primarily for parsing or text processing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from self._input.read() and retrieves regular expressions via self._input.get_regexp().",
  "sinks": "Data flow from self._input.read() to internal variables like whitespace_before_token; no data is sent externally or used maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input data is fetched through self._input.read() and regular expressions via self._input.get_regexp(), then processed internally to count newlines and store whitespace.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of whitespace pattern handling. It initializes regex patterns based on input, processes input data to count newlines, and stores whitespace before tokens. The methods involve creating regex objects, reading input, and updating internal state—all standard behaviors in text parsing. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a utility class for whitespace parsing within a larger project, with no external network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for pattern matching and whitespace processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this snippet.",
