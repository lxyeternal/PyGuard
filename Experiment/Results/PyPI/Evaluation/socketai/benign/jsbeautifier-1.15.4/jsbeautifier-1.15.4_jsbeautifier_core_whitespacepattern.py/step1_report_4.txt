{
  "purpose": "Define a class for handling whitespace patterns and parsing whitespace in input streams.",
  "sources": "Input stream accessed via self._input.read() and self._input.get_regexp() methods.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is being written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input stream provides data to read() which is processed internally; no external flows or untrusted data influencing control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard pattern matching and string splitting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'WhitespacePattern' inheriting from 'Pattern', used for handling whitespace and newline recognition in input streams. It initializes regex patterns based on parent input or default whitespace, and provides methods to read and match whitespace patterns. No external data is fetched from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no code injection mechanisms are present. The methods utilize existing input stream functions to process data, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of whitespace pattern matching with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to parse whitespace in input streams without external interactions or sensitive data handling.",
