{
  "purpose": "Provides a utility class for scanning, matching, and reading input strings using regular expressions and character-based operations.",
  "sources": "Input string provided to the constructor (__init__), methods like next(), peek(), test(), testChar(), match(), read(), readUntil(), readUntilAfter(), and get_regexp() which process or analyze the input string.",
  "sinks": "Methods that could process untrusted input include match(), read(), readUntil(), readUntilAfter(), and test(). These can potentially process malicious input if the input is externally controlled and used insecurely downstream, but within this code, they are used for pattern matching and reading.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the input string into various methods, which perform regex matching or character access. For example, next() reads a character at the current position, match() applies regex, and readUntil() searches for patterns; these flows can lead to data extraction or manipulation but do not perform unsafe actions like executing code.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports the 'six' module but does not use it beyond class type checks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious code behavior such as network calls, file access, or external commands. No encryption, credential handling, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The class InputScanner is a standard utility for string parsing with regex and character operations. It uses safe practices such as regex compilation and character lookahead. The dynamic import of 'six' is benign and used for Python 2/3 compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. The methods are self-contained, performing string processing tasks without external side effects. The overall code is straightforward, well-structured, and appears to serve legitimate input parsing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical input scanning utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or network operations. It is safe and intended for string pattern processing and tokenization. The overall security risk score is very low.",
