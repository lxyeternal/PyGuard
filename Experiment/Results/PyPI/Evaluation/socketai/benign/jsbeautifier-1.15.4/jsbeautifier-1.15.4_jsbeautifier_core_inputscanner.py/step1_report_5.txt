{
  "purpose": "A utility class for scanning and reading through input strings with pattern matching capabilities.",
  "sources": "The input string provided during instantiation (__input), and pattern inputs for methods like match, test, read, etc.",
  "sinks": "Methods that process or return data, such as next(), read(), readUntil(), readUntilAfter(), and match(). These methods handle untrusted input data and may return or process it.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the __input string through various methods, with pattern matching and reading operations, potentially returning segments of untrusted input based on pattern matches.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import (__import__('six')) and internal pattern matching methods appear standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides string input management with pattern matching and reading functionalities, utilizing the 're' module and dynamic import of 'six' for compatibility. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. All methods appear to operate solely on input data and patterns, with no network, file, or environment variable access. The code structure and logic are straightforward and typical for string parsing utilities. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code performs expected operations securely and cleanly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard input scanner class designed for string pattern matching and reading operations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended without any suspicious or malicious code present.",
