{
  "purpose": "A utility class for scanning, matching, and reading substrings from an input string, primarily used for pattern matching and tokenization.",
  "sources": "Input string provided during class instantiation (__input), patterns passed to match, test, read, readUntil, and lookBack methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods that process patterns and input string data such as match(), read(), readUntil(), test(), and lookBack(). These handle untrusted input data for pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Input string flows into the class via __init__, then methods like match(), read(), test(), and readUntil() process this data based on pattern matching, updating the position (__position).",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('six') for compatibility; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The class does not perform external network communication or file system access.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern matching utility class designed for string parsing. It uses regex matching and position tracking to read and analyze input data. No suspicious logic, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The use of the __import__('six') module is typical for compatibility and does not indicate obfuscation or malware. All functions operate solely on input data and patterns, with no external data leaks, network activity, or harmful operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for pattern-based string parsing with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs typical pattern matching and reading functions, which are common in text processing libraries. No security risks or malware are detected.",
