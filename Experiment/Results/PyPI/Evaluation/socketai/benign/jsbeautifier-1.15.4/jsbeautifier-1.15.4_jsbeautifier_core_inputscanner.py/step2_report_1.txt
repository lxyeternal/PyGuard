  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a string parsing utility class (`InputScanner`) that uses regex and character operations.\n- No report indicates the presence of malicious code, external network activity, or backdoors.\n- The only noted anomaly is the dynamic import of `'six'` for compatibility, which is benign and common practice.\n- All reports assign very low security risk scores (~0.1 to 0.2), with no malware detected.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating the reviewers believe the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with no suspicious constructs.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports find any evidence of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network calls, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code is detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The code performs regex matching and string manipulation safely; no vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The logic in the code is straightforward and standard for such utility classes.\n- The use of `__import__('six')` is benign and for compatibility.\n- No errors, flaws, or security flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0.1–0.2\n- These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest risk scores higher than 0.5. Given the absence of malicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No suspicious activity or code patterns are present.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis and pattern review.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are made; the conclusion is consistent with the code content.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- The confidence levels reflect high certainty in benignity.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (consistent with low risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, well-implemented string parsing utility with no malicious or obfuscated features.**\n\n---\n\n## My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and contains no malicious features. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
