  "conclusion": "The `InputScanner` class is a benign, utility-focused string parsing tool with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dynamic import of `six` is for compatibility and does not introduce security concerns. The code is safe for use, and the security assessments and scores in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature."
