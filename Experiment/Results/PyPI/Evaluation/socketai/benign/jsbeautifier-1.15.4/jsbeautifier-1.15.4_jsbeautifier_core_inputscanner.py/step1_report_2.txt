  "purpose": "A utility class for reading and pattern matching within an input string, supporting operations like reading until patterns, peeking, and matching regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Input string provided to the constructor (__input), pattern parameters for methods (e.g., pattern.match, pattern.search, pattern.pattern).",
  "sinks": "Regex match and search methods that process input data (match, read, readUntil, test, testChar, peek, lookBack). No external data sinks or outputs are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input string data flows through methods that perform regex matching and substring extraction, with internal state (__position) tracking read progress. No untrusted external data flows into sensitive sinks outside input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic regex compilation via get_regexp; reliance on __import__('six') to support compatibility; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic; methods are straightforward. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The class implements typical string parsing utilities using regex, with no signs of malicious behavior. The only notable feature is dynamic regex compilation in get_regexp, which is standard practice. No external network, file, or system calls, and no data exfiltration or backdoors are present. The code appears purely for parsing input strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string parsing utility with no indications of malicious behavior or malware. It performs regex-based input reading and pattern matching with standard Python practices. No security risks or malicious intent are detected.",
