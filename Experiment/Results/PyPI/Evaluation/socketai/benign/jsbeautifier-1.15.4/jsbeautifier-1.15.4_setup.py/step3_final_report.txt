{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of the jsbeautifier Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "The version is imported from jsbeautifier.__version__, and the setup parameters are static literals and imports.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies without processing external input.",
  "flows": "The version import flows into the setup configuration; no dynamic or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical static setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. All elements are standard, and the import of version info from a local module is common practice. The reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, with high confidence, and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
