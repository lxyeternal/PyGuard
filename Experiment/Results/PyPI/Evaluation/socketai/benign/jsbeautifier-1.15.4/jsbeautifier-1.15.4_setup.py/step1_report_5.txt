  "sources": "Imports version from jsbeautifier.__version__, setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output beyond package metadata and script entry points",
  "flows": "Import of version info -> setup configuration -> defining entry points and package list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no unusual code patterns or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package. It imports version info, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The code is straightforward, using the setuptools library for package installation. No code reads user input, writes data, or performs any network or system operations. No suspicious or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The script is safe and does not pose a supply chain security risk.",
