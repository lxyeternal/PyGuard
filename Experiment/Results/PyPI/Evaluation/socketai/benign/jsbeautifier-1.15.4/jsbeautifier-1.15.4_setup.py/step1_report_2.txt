  "purpose": "Setup script for the jsbeautifier Python package, used for JavaScript beautification and deobfuscation.",
  "sources": "Imports version information from jsbeautifier.__version__; reads setup configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; mainly static configuration.",
  "flows": "Imports version info, then calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version info from a module, then invokes setuptools.setup() to define package metadata and dependencies. No user input or untrusted data sources are present. No code execution beyond standard package installation setup. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs. The package appears to be a legitimate setup script for a JavaScript beautifier library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
