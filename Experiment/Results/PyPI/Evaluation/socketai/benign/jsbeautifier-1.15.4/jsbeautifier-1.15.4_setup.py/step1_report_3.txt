  "purpose": "Setup script for the jsbeautifier package, used to install and configure the package and its metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from jsbeautifier.__version__, importing setuptools, and reading package information from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or input; the script only defines package metadata and installation configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script's flow is limited to static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It imports package version information, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for command-line execution. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors. The code is straightforward, typical for Python package setup scripts, with no obfuscation or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be legitimate, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present.",
