{
  "purpose": "The code implements a text formatting utility managing lines, indentation, wrapping, and output generation. It provides classes for line handling, indentation caching, and output assembly, with no external data sources or malicious behaviors.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters, options, tokens, and internal state; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Generates output strings via methods like get_code() and toString(); no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and tokens into internal line and indentation management, culminating in formatted output strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected. Uses standard modules (re, math) safely. No network or file I/O.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured text formatting utility. It manages lines, indentation, wrapping, and output assembly through clear classes and methods. No external data or network activity is present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The logic is standard for formatting tasks, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard text formatting utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its purpose and behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
