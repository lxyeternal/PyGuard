{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for managing formatted text output with indentation, line wrapping, and line manipulation, primarily for text formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method parameters such as tokens, input strings, and options passed during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted text via methods like get_code() and toString(), and manipulates internal line structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from tokens or input strings into internal line objects, which are then converted to strings for output, with indentation and wrapping logic controlling presentation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity present. The code primarily handles text formatting; no suspicious I/O or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured text formatting utility involving line and indentation management. It initializes classes for handling individual lines (OutputLine), caching indentation strings (IndentStringCache), and overall output management (Output). Methods handle line wrapping, indentation adjustments, and output generation. All code appears consistent with its purpose, with no signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or covert channels. The absence of network activity, external data fetching, or sensitive data handling suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate text formatting utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code's structure and content suggest it is safe for use.",
