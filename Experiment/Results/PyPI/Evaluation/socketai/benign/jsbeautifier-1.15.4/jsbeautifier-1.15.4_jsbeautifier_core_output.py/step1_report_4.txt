{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a formatting utility for managing output lines with indentation, wrapping, and spacing, likely used for code or text formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters such as tokens, base strings, and options. Also reads input through class initializations and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted text through the get_code() method, which returns a string of the formatted content.",
  "flows": "Input tokens and options -> process in OutputLine and Output classes -> formatted lines stored internally -> get_code() retrieves final formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard math and re modules. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing text output lines with indentation and wrapping features, including caching mechanisms for indentation strings. It includes methods for adding, removing, and trimming lines and tokens, with logical flow for formatting text output. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file manipulation, or hidden backdoors, are present. The code uses standard Python modules and appears to be a legitimate formatting utility.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a text formatting utility with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and practices appropriate for its purpose, with no suspicious or anomalous code patterns observed.",
