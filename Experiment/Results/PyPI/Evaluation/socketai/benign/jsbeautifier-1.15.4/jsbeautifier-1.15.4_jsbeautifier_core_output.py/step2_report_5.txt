  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code manages output lines, indentation, and wrapping—standard formatting utility. No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Uses standard classes and methods.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, straightforward formatting code. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar utility for text formatting with indentation and wrapping. No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious activity. Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) possibly due to conservative default.\n- **Assessment:** Legitimate utility code, low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Consistent with previous, handling text formatting, indentation, wrapping.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external dependencies or network activity.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly a benign formatting utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar purpose; no external input sources or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Assessment:** Legitimate formatting code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard internal formatting functions, no external untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Clear, legitimate utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports consistently describe code that is a text formatting utility—no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are zero, which aligns with the code's apparent purpose.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports, likely due to conservative default scores for utility code, but none indicate actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a well-structured, standard text formatting utility.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The scores assigned (0 malware, 0 obfuscated) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the utility's benign purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, based on conservative assessment of utility code)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports provided.",
