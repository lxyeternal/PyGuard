{
  "purpose": "The code appears to parse specific directive patterns from text inputs, likely for code formatting or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Input text passed to get_directives() and readIgnored() methods.",
  "sinks": "The readUntilAfter() method on input object, which could potentially process external data, depending on implementation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into get_directives() to match patterns and extract directives; input data also flows into readIgnored() for further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex patterns for directive matching and ignore patterns; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures; no external network access, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes regex patterns for matching specific directive blocks and directives within text. get_directives() checks if the input text matches a pattern, then searches for directives within the text, storing key-value pairs. readIgnored() reads from an input source until a specific ignore pattern is matched. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling; the code appears to be straightforward parsing logic. It operates solely on input data and regex matching, with no external network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard parsing utility for directives within text data. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It’s well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
