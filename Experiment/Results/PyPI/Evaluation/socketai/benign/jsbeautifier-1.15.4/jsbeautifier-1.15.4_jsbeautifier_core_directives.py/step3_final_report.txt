  "purpose": "A class for parsing directive blocks in text using regex patterns, extracting key-value pairs, and reading until a specific pattern is matched.",
  "sources": "Input text for matching regex patterns; input.readUntilAfter method for reading data until a pattern match.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data; potential concern is the input.readUntilAfter method if input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "get_directives() matches the entire block pattern, then searches for directives; readIgnored() reads from input until a pattern match.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex patterns that could be exploited with crafted input leading to ReDoS; reliance on input.readUntilAfter without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that compiles regex patterns based on provided start and end patterns. It checks if input text matches the block pattern, then extracts directives via regex search, returning a dictionary. The readIgnored method reads from an input object until a specific pattern is matched, using an external method. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The main concern is regex ReDoS vulnerability if input is maliciously crafted, but this is a known regex performance issue, not malicious intent. The code is straightforward and standard for configuration parsing. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with minor concern about regex performance. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, and the risk is minimal and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard directive parser with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security concern is regex ReDoS potential, which is a known and manageable risk. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
