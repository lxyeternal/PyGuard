  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any suspicious aspects.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard tokenizer with placeholder methods; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** Methods like `_is_comment`, `_is_opening`, `_is_closing` are stubs, which suggests incomplete implementation rather than malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature and incomplete logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code appears benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with stub methods indicating incomplete implementation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no external system interaction, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a tokenizer with stub methods, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No external interactions, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; incomplete implementation with placeholder methods.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 fit the context.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; incomplete methods, no malicious signs.\n- **Findings:** No external system calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe code that is a standard, incomplete tokenizer framework with placeholder methods.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, incomplete nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to incomplete implementation, which could be a maintenance or extension concern but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears to be a benign, incomplete tokenizer template. No supply chain or malicious activity concerns are evident from the provided code and reports.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (acceptable given incomplete code)  \n\nNo further action needed.",
