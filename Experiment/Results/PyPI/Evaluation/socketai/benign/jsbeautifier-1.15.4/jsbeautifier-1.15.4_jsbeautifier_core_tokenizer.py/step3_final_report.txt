  "purpose": "Tokenizer framework for parsing input strings into tokens, with placeholder methods for comments and structural elements.",
  "sources": "Input string read via InputScanner, whitespace patterns, and token creation functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input read -> whitespace skipped -> token created -> placeholder methods (always false) determine structure -> tokens added to stream.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder methods (_is_comment, _is_opening, _is_closing) unimplemented, always returning False, indicating incomplete or base class design.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal or incomplete tokenizer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The placeholder methods suggest it is a scaffold for extension rather than a malicious or obfuscated component. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the low security risk reflects the incomplete but benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete tokenizer framework with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the analysis. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
