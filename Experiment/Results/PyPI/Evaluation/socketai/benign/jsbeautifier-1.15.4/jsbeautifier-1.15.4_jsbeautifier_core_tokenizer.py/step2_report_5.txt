  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reported issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a tokenizer with placeholder methods (`_is_comment`, `_is_opening`, `_is_closing`) that currently do not implement any logic, always returning False.\n- The code appears to be incomplete or a base class meant for extension.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The code does not interact with external systems in a suspicious manner, nor does it contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- The scores assigned are all very low for malware and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The placeholder methods always returning False are present and clearly indicate incomplete implementation.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the placeholder nature of key methods and the lack of malicious code. They do not overstate the security implications, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The scores for malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are reasonable given the current code state. The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- The code's incomplete state means it could be extended maliciously in the future, but as-is, it does not contain malicious logic.\n- The reports do not claim any malicious intent or actual vulnerabilities, only incomplete or minimal implementation.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- Since no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present, malware score remains at 0.\n- The risk score is low, reflecting that this is a minimal or incomplete component with no current security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, incomplete tokenizer framework with placeholder methods.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as the code is incomplete but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, incomplete, and designed as a tokenizer component. The current scores are justified. Future extensions could introduce risks, but as provided, the code is safe.",
