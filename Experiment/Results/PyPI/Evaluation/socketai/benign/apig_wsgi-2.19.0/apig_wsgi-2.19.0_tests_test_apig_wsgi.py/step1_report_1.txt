{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of tests and utility functions for a Python AWS Lambda WSGI handler implementation, verifying correct behavior for various API Gateway (V1, V2, ALB) event formats and ensuring proper request/response handling.",
  "sources": "Data read from event parameters such as headers, query parameters, body, cookies, and context objects; environment variables set from headers and event fields.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable assignments (e.g., environ dict updates), function calls (make_lambda_handler), response construction including base64 encoding for binary data, and header processing.",
  "flows": "Event data (query params, headers, body, cookies) flows into environment variables and response objects; request data from events is processed and passed to the handler, with potential modifications or encoding based on content type or binary support settings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code predominantly consists of test cases and utility functions; no obfuscated code, external network calls, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured testing of a Lambda WSGI handler, focusing on input parsing, environment variable setup, response formatting, and support for binary data. The test functions include checks for correct header processing, query string encoding, cookie handling, and request context injection. No suspicious logic or malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets were found. All operations are related to testing expected behaviors in controlled scenarios. The code adheres to safe practices, with no evidence of malware or security compromises.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for a WSGI handler in AWS Lambda environments. It performs no malicious activities, contains no hidden backdoors or exploits, and demonstrates standard testing of request/response processing logic. Overall, it appears secure and benign.",
