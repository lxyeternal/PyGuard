{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for AWS Lambda WSGI handlers, verifying request parsing, headers, query parameters, response formatting, binary support, and context injection.",
  "sources": "Event parameters (headers, query strings, body), context objects, environment variables, response objects",
  "sinks": "Environment variables, response dicts, request environment, base64 encoding for binary data",
  "flows": "Event data flows into environment variables and response formatting; no external network or malicious code execution occurs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward testing logic, with data flows confined to request parsing and response construction. No external calls, code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices, and the test cases cover various scenarios including binary data, headers, query strings, and context injection. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted input, which is standard in testing environments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near 0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended solely for testing AWS Lambda request handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
