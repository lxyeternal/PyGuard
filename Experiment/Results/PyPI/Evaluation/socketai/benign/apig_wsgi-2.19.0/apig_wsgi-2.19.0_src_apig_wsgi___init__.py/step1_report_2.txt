{
  "purpose": "This code transforms a WSGI application into an AWS Lambda handler for API Gateway, supporting different event versions and response formats.",
  "sources": "Reads event data such as headers, query parameters, body (including base64 decoding), and request context from the Lambda event object.",
  "sinks": "Constructs WSGI environ, processes HTTP responses, encodes response bodies as base64 when binary, and returns API Gateway compatible response dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Input event data → parsing headers, query, body → environment setup → WSGI app invocation → response processing and encoding → API Gateway response output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of standard libraries, no obfuscated code, and no unusual network or system actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly converts AWS Lambda event data into a WSGI environment, invokes a provided WSGI application, and formats the response for API Gateway. It handles different event versions (1.0, 2.0, alb) securely and correctly encodes/decodes request bodies, including base64 data. Response handling involves checking content types and encoding responses as base64 for binary content, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, no network connections, or data exfiltration routines are present. The code does not contain obfuscated segments, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its purpose is solely to serve as a compatible adapter between Lambda events and WSGI apps, with standard security practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical WSGI-to-Lambda adapter with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data handling and environment setup securely, using standard Python practices. There are no suspicious signals or malicious functionalities detected.",
