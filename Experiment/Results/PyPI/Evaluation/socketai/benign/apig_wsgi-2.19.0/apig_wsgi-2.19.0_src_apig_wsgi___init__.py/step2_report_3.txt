  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a WSGI-to-Lambda adapter, with accurate source identification.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no external network calls, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, high confidence (0.9), malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues detected. The score of 0 for malware and obfuscated is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate, matching the code's functionality.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no external network activity, and standard handling of request data.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.9), malware at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard adapter with no malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's role.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence (1.0), malware at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no external network calls, standard data handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-justified, high confidence (0.9), malware at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.95), malware at 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Review:** The code is a standard implementation of a WSGI-to-Lambda adapter supporting multiple API Gateway versions, handling binary and non-binary responses securely. It uses standard libraries, has no obfuscated segments, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as expected for such utility code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the scores assigned by the reports:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 to 0.2 (all reports indicate minimal to no risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured, and performs a standard task without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
