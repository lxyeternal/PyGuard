  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying critical security assessment principles.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly describes the code as a WSGI-to-Lambda adapter supporting different event versions. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is indicated. The report emphasizes the absence of backdoors, external calls, or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion is consistent with the code. The confidence level is high (0.9). The malware score is 0, and no security risks are flagged.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code matches the description; no issues detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed explanation of input parsing, environment setup, and response encoding. No suspicious code or external activity is observed. The report states the code is a standard adapter, with no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent, high confidence (0.9). Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to general caution, but not indicative of actual risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates the code's function as a WSGI adapter, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The reasoning is consistent, and no suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1.0). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No issues; the code appears benign and standard.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing correct handling of request data and response encoding. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are observed.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, confirms the code as a request/response adapter with no suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is consistent with a standard, safe WSGI adapter.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not contain any suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, network calls, file writes, or obfuscation. The code relies solely on standard libraries and well-understood patterns.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **around 0.0 to 0.1**, given the standard functionality and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.** The code is a standard, secure WSGI-to-Lambda adapter with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0.0 - 0.1             |\n\n**Note:** The low risk score reflects the code's benign nature; no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
