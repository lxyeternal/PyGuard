  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a utility for converting WSGI apps into AWS Lambda handlers, supporting multiple API Gateway versions and binary content types.\n- It uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- No suspicious code, external network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- It handles request parsing, environment setup, response encoding, and supports binary responses via base64 encoding.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code transforms WSGI apps into Lambda handlers, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizing secure environment conversion, correct handling of binary data, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly above zero, perhaps reflecting minimal inherent risk, but still reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is sound; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar, with emphasis on correctness and safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious signs.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar, noting standard practices and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious signals.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, confirms the code's purpose and safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- Given the code's straightforward nature, I agree with the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n### **My final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0 to 0.2** — all reports agree on very low risk; I would set it at **0.1** for conservativeness.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility for WSGI-to-Lambda conversion, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
