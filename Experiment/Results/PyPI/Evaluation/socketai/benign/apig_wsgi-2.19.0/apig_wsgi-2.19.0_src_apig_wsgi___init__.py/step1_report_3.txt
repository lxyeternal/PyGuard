{
  "purpose": "The code converts a WSGI application into a Lambda handler for API Gateway, supporting different versions and binary content handling.",
  "sources": "Reading event data (event dict), environment variables, request body (base64 or plain), headers, query parameters, request context.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly perform actions that could be malicious such as network calls, file writes, or executing untrusted code. Response generation encodes data for API Gateway.",
  "flows": "Event data is parsed into WSGI environ, passed to the app, response is captured, and returned in API Gateway format. No external data is injected into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments observed. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors detected. All code appears standard for a serverless WSGI handler.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly handles different API Gateway versions, encodes/decodes request bodies, and manages binary support. It uses standard libraries and patterns without suspicious side effects. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. It appears to be a legitimate utility for WSGI-to-Lambda conversion. The code lacks any malicious patterns such as eval, exec, file writes, or network communication. The only potential concern is the handling of headers and body encoding, which is standard practice, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured WSGI Lambda adapter with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely manages request/response transformation and binary support, with no suspicious signals detected.",
