  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a utility that converts WSGI applications into AWS Lambda handlers, supporting different API Gateway versions and binary content handling.\n- They emphasize that the code uses standard libraries, follows conventional patterns, and does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The analysis consistently finds no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or above), and the malware scores are 0 across all reports.\n- The security risks are minimal, primarily related to standard handling of binary data, which is expected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation for WSGI-to-Lambda conversion.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious external calls are present.\n- The logic and flow are consistent with standard practices.\n- No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No significant logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- Minor points:\n  - The `non_binary_content_type_prefixes` parameter is a tuple of strings; the code correctly defaults to a predefined set.\n  - The handling of headers and body encoding is standard and safe.\n  - The response classes correctly implement the expected API Gateway response formats.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Given the thorough analysis and absence of vulnerabilities, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk score > 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely for WSGI adaptation and contains no malicious features, a high risk score is unjustified.\n- The minimal risk (0.1) reflects the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but not inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n### Consistency check:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with their analysis.\n- No report claims any malicious activity or obfuscation, so the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to the nature of handling HTTP data, not security flaws.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, secure utility for integrating WSGI applications with AWS Lambda. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the thorough review and consistent findings across all reports.",
