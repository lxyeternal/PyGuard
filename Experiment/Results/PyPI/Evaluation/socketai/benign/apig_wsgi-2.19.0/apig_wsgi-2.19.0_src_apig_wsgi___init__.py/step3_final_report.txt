{
  "purpose": "The code converts a WSGI application into an AWS Lambda handler compatible with API Gateway and ALB, supporting multiple versions and binary content types.",
  "sources": "Request data from event dicts, including headers, query parameters, body, and context.",
  "sinks": "Response encoding (base64), setting headers, and environment variable parsing, but no malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from event parsing through environment setup to response encoding, with no suspicious data leaks or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for WSGI-to-Lambda conversion, handling request parsing, environment setup, and response formatting securely. It uses standard libraries, no obfuscation, no external network activity, and no hardcoded secrets. The response classes correctly implement API Gateway response formats, including binary support. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard WSGI adaptation for AWS Lambda with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the low inherent risk of such utility code.",
