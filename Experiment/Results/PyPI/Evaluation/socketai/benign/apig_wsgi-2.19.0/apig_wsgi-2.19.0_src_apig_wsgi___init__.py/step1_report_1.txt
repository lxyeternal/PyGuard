{
  "purpose": "This code transforms a WSGI application into an AWS Lambda handler compatible with API Gateway or ALB, handling different event versions and response formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from event['body'], event headers, query parameters, and request context.",
  "sinks": "Processes and encodes response data, handles headers and cookies, and writes to BytesIO streams.",
  "flows": "Event data -> get_body() -> get_environ_v1()/get_environ_v2() -> wsgi_app -> response.consume() -> response.as_apig_response()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. Use of standard libraries and conventional data handling. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code securely processes incoming event data, converts it into WSGI environment, and constructs a response object. It supports binary and non-binary responses with appropriate encoding. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads are detected. The functions are straightforward and follow standard patterns for WSGI-to-Lambda conversion. No suspicious external calls or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for integrating WSGI apps with AWS Lambda. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate API Gateway/ALB integration without introducing security vulnerabilities.",
