  "purpose": "Define the WSGIApplication type for compatibility across Python versions, with a partial backport implementation for Python versions earlier than 3.11.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, wsgiref.types, collections.abc, types, and typing modules. Conditional code based on sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code primarily defines types and protocols without executing untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; the code only declares types and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports and defines types to ensure compatibility with different Python versions. It uses standard modules and constructs, defines a Protocol for start_response, and a type alias for WSGI applications. No input/output operations, external network calls, or code execution mechanisms are present. The code serves as a compatibility shim, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for defining WSGI application types across Python versions. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and poses no security risks.",
