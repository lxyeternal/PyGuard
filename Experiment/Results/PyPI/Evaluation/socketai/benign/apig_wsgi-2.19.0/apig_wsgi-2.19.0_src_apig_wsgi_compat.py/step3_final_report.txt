  "purpose": "Provides a compatibility layer for defining WSGIApplication types across different Python versions, importing directly from wsgiref.types if available, or defining types manually for earlier versions.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, sys.version_info check, type annotations, and Protocol class definition.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Conditional import or type definition based on Python version; no data flow involving external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward compatibility shim.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, version-dependent import and type aliasing for WSGI application types. It contains no runtime data processing, external communication, or malicious code. The logic is standard and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All security and malware scores are appropriately zero, and confidence is high due to the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured compatibility layer with no malicious or security risks. The current scores are accurate and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
