{
  "purpose": "Define or import the WSGIApplication type for WSGI server implementations, with compatibility for Python versions below 3.11.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, wsgiref.types, collections.abc, types, and typing modules; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no functions executing external commands or handling sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; the code mainly defines types and compatibility interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports or defines types related to WSGI applications based on Python version. It uses standard library modules and type hints, with no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The partial backport is straightforward and intended for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility shim for WSGI application typing across different Python versions. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and is safe.",
