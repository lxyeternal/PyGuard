  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a compatibility layer for defining `WSGIApplication` types across Python versions, with conditional imports and type definitions.\n- No untrusted data handling, external commands, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code is straightforward, primarily involving type annotations, Protocols, and conditional imports.\n- No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious logic.\n   - The purpose is solely compatibility, and the implementation is standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The logic for version checking and type definitions appears correct and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasonableness:**\n   - Malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - Security risk is 0, as there are no external data flows or potential attack vectors.\n   - Confidence is 1, reflecting high certainty in the assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No scores above 0.5 are assigned, which is correct.\n   - The code is safe and does not pose security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious intent.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a compatibility shim.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign compatibility layer with no malicious or security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured compatibility shim.\n- No issues, errors, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scoring is appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** No security concerns; the code is safe.",
