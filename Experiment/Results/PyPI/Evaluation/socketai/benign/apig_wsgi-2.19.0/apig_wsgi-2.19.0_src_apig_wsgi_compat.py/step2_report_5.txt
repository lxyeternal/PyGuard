  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a compatibility layer for defining or importing the `WSGIApplication` type across different Python versions.\n- They highlight that the code conditionally imports or defines types based on `sys.version_info`.\n- No untrusted data handling, external commands, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose is straightforward: ensure compatibility for WSGI server implementations across Python versions.\n\n**Confirmations & Discrepancies:**\n- The code matches the described purpose in all reports.\n- No issues or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and intended solely for type compatibility.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Security risk: 0, since no external data, execution, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- Confidence: 1, indicating high certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Potential Concerns or Challenges:**\n- The reports are thorough and align well with the code's purpose.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could be exploited or cause harm.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign compatibility shim.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, harmless compatibility layer with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature.",
