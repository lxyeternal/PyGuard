{
  "purpose": "Define or import the WSGIApplication type for WSGI server compatibility, with compatibility for Python versions below 3.11.",
  "sources": "Imports sys for version info, conditional imports of types from wsgiref.types or backports, and module-level definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only defines types and imports without executing untrusted data or performing external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; primarily type definitions and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is standard for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing future annotations and sys. It conditionally imports WSGIApplication type depending on Python version, providing a backport implementation if needed. The backport defines Protocol and related types to emulate wsgiref.types for older Python versions. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no external data handling, no code execution, and no indications of malicious intent. The code is straightforward for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility layer for WSGIApplication type definitions across Python versions. It is standard, well-structured, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
