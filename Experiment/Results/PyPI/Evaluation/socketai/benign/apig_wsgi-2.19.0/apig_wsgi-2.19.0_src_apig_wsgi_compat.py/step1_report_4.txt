{
  "purpose": "Define or import the WSGIApplication type based on Python version compatibility, with a partial backport if needed.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, import statements, code logic determining Python version, type definitions, class definition.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily defines types and classes without executing untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a straightforward compatibility layer for WSGI application type definitions, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version at runtime. If the version is >= 3.11, it imports WSGIApplication from wsgiref.types. Otherwise, it creates a partial backport by defining necessary types and protocols, including StartResponse and related type annotations. All definitions are standard, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious logic. The purpose is compatibility across Python versions for WSGI applications. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code does not perform any network operations, data storage, or other actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility layer for WSGI application type definitions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware is present.",
