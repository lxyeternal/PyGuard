  "purpose": "Define or import the WSGIApplication type for use in WSGI server implementations, with compatibility for Python versions >= 3.11.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, wsgiref.types, collections.abc, types, and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code conditionally imports or defines WSGIApplication based on Python version; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs version-dependent imports and type definitions, typical for compatibility management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines types for WSGI applications, adapting to different Python versions. It does not process external input, handle sensitive data, or execute dynamic code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The structure and logic are straightforward and standard for compatibility layers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module for defining WSGIApplication types across Python versions, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
