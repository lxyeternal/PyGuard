{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom immutable and mutable dictionary and list classes, along with utility functions for deep data structure transformations, access, modification, and deletion.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input arguments to functions, constructor parameters, and internal dictionary/list attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no data leakage, network operations, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into class constructors, which convert data to immutable forms; data is then manipulated via class methods that operate on internal structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or system modification activities detected. The code's primary focus is on data structure handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for data structure conversions, deep get/set/delete operations, and custom dict/list classes that prevent property assignment and support deep modifications. The functions like _set_in, _delete_in, and _get_in operate purely on data structures; no external system or network activity is involved. The classes restrict property assignment to prevent unintended modifications, indicating intent for controlled data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious payloads, malicious data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The code appears to be a well-structured utility for data handling with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for deep data structure manipulation with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It is likely intended for use in secure data handling within larger applications.",
