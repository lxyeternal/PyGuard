{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes and functions for immutable and mutable data structures, mainly dictionaries and lists, with support for nested data access and modification.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input arguments during object initialization (__init__), method calls (set, delete, set_in, delete_in), and from internal data structures during various operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that perform dangerous actions such as network communication, file operations, or security-sensitive operations. The code mainly manipulates data structures in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through conversion functions (to_immutable, to_mutable), into internal data structures, and through methods that modify or access nested data via keys.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The functions `_set_in`, `_delete_in`, and `_get_in` perform recursive access and modification but do not execute untrusted code or perform external actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for immutable (Dict, List) and mutable (via to_mutable) data structures, with methods for nested data access and modification. The functions handle nested key paths, and the classes enforce read-only properties for attribute assignment. No external calls, no network, no file I/O, and no code execution are present. The code appears to be a standard utility for data handling with support for nested data structures and immutability, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility library for managing nested data structures in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code segment. It mainly facilitates safe data manipulation without external side effects.",
