{
  "purpose": "Provides custom immutable and mutable data structures (Dict, List) with deep conversion and access functions for nested data management.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, method calls (e.g., __init__, set, delete, get_in, set_in, delete_in)",
  "sinks": "In-memory data manipulation without external I/O, network, or system calls",
  "flows": "Data flows through deep get/set/delete functions and class methods manipulating internal _data structures",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external system interactions detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions for deep data structure handling, including conversion between mutable and immutable forms, deep access, and modification. It restricts property assignment to prevent unintended modifications. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code operates solely on in-memory data, with standard patterns and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The security posture is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility library for nested data management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is minimal (~0.1), consistent with its utility nature.",
