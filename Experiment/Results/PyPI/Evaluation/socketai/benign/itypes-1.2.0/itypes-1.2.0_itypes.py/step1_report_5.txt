{
  "purpose": "This code provides immutable and mutable dictionary and list classes with utility functions for nested data manipulation, along with versioning support.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, class initializers, and standard dictionary/list operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that modify data structures (set, set_in, delete, delete_in), but they operate on passed data and do not perform untrusted input handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (function parameters and initializers) through transformation functions (to_mutable, to_immutable, _to_hashable), then via set/delete operations that produce modified copies of data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of custom classes for data immutability and mutation appears standard. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for immutable and mutable collections with methods to set, delete, and retrieve nested data via key paths. Utility functions convert between mutable and immutable representations and facilitate nested data access. There are no indications of external network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling. The use of 'clone' methods suggests support for chaining or extension, but no malicious patterns are present. The code appears to implement safe data handling and transformation routines without external dependencies that could be exploited. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard implementation of immutable and mutable data structures with nested data access functions. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. The code is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated segments.",
