  "purpose": "Apply a Gaussian blur to an image if the NSFW safety check detects inappropriate content.",
  "sources": "Reading image input, extracting features with 'feature_extractor', calling the 'nsfw_checker' model.",
  "sinks": "Filtering the image with ImageFilter.GaussianBlur if NSFW content is detected.",
  "flows": "Image data is processed by 'feature_extractor' -> passed to 'nsfw_checker' -> if NSFW detected, the image is blurred.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a dummy tensor '[0]' in 'images' list is unusual but appears to be a placeholder; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries and defines an 'apply' function that performs an NSFW safety check using models retrieved from the 'context'. It prepares input data with 'feature_extractor' and runs a model 'nsfw_checker' to identify inappropriate content. If detected, it applies a Gaussian blur filter to the image. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The use of a dummy tensor is unusual but likely for placeholder purposes, not malicious. No external network activity or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs content moderation on images with standard methods, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
