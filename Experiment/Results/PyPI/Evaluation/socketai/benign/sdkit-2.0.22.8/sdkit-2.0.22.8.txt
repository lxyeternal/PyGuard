      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign dependency declaration script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The dependency list and code structure are typical for open-source AI/ML projects. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, aligning with the evidence. The small risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are unnecessary and should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy."

The staticmethod patch is unconventional but safe and necessary for compatibility. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use."
