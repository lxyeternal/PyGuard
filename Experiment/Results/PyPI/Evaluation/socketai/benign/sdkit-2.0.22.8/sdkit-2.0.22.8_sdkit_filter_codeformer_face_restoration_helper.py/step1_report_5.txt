  "purpose": "Helper class for face restoration, including face detection, landmark detection, alignment, warping, and face pasting.",
  "sources": "Loading models from URLs, reading images, and performing detection and inference functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing or saving images, affine matrices, and inverse matrices to disk.",
  "flows": "Input images are loaded, processed, faces are detected and aligned, then faces are restored and pasted back into images, with optional saving of results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external URLs for model downloads; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious data exfiltration or network communications; no obfuscated code; image processing appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a face restoration pipeline with detection, alignment, and image processing functions. It downloads models from reputable URLs, uses established libraries (cv2, torch, dlib), and saves intermediate results if specified. No code appears designed for malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system damage, or covert operations. There are no hidden backdoors or suspicious network behaviors. The code structure and functions are consistent with legitimate face restoration tasks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns or functions were identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard face detection, alignment, and restoration tasks without any indications of malicious behavior. It downloads models from official URLs, does not include harmful network or system operations, and follows typical image processing workflows. Overall, the risk of malicious intent is very low.",
