  "purpose": "Declare dependencies for a Python package setup, primarily related to AI/ML and image processing.",
  "sources": "The install_requires list specifying package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; dependencies are static.",
  "flows": "No data flows; dependency list is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; dependencies are standard and well-known.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script defining a list of dependencies. No dynamic code execution, input handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Dependencies are common in AI/ML and image processing projects. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code structure is standard, and the dependencies are reputable packages. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low or zero. Minor variations in risk scores across reports are due to conservative caution but are not justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign dependency declaration script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The dependency list and code structure are typical for open-source AI/ML projects. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, aligning with the evidence. The small risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are unnecessary and should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
