  "purpose": "Define dependencies for a Python project setup using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'install_requires' list specifies external packages required for the project.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; dependencies are specified for installation but no execution or data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; dependencies are used during installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It lists multiple external dependencies with specific versions, which is typical for ensuring reproducible environments. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network or system actions are present. All dependencies appear to be related to image processing, machine learning, or AI tools, consistent with a legitimate project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage in this straightforward dependency declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script specifying dependencies for a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code. It appears safe and legitimate.",
