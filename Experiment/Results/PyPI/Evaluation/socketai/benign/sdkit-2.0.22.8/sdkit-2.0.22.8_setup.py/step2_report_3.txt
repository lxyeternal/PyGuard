  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script defining dependencies.\n- No dynamic code execution, data handling, or obfuscation is observed.\n- All dependencies are well-known, relevant packages for AI/ML/image processing.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, standard setup configuration, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is sound. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard dependencies, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Conclusion:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup script, dependencies relevant to AI/ML, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero; perhaps considering the 'securityRisk' as minimal, but since no suspicious activity is present, this could be lowered.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Analysis of the risk score:** The small non-zero value suggests a minimal concern, but given the code's benign nature, this should be zero. The report's reasoning is sound, but the risk score could be adjusted downward.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Similar to others, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Similar assessment, no anomalies.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — again, perhaps slightly high for such a benign script.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scores:**\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, accurate.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), but given the nature of the code, should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The malware score should be **0**.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- The security risk score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. The only adjustment needed is lowering the small risk scores from 0.1 to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
