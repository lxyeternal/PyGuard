  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying its dependencies.",
  "sources": "The install_requires list specifying package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious dependencies if they contain malicious code, but here they are standard package specifications.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are declared for installation but do not execute code or transfer data within this script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script that declares dependencies for a Python package. All listed dependencies are typical for machine learning or image processing tasks. There is no code execution, no data handling, and no suspicious patterns present. The dependencies appear legitimate, with version specifications for some packages. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with well-known dependencies. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are identified. The code is standard and safe.",
