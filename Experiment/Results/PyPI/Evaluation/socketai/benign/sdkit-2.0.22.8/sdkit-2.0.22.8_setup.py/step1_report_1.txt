  "purpose": "To specify dependencies for a Python package setup using setuptools",
  "sources": "The install_requires list specifying package dependencies",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious code execution",
  "flows": "N/A — the code solely defines dependencies without executing external data or commands",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; all dependencies are standard Python packages, mostly related to AI/ML workflows",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, listing specific dependencies with fixed versions or version ranges. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The dependencies include well-known packages related to AI/ML, image processing, and web requests, with no unusual or malicious package names or version manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for managing package dependencies with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a benign configuration for an AI/ML project.",
