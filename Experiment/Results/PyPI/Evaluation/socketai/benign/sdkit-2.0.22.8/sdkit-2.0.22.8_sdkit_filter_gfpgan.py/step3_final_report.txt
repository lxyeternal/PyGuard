  "purpose": "Image enhancement using GFP-GAN with thread safety considerations.",
  "sources": "Input image (via PIL), model enhancement function, internal import of 'retinaface' for detection.",
  "sinks": "Output image after enhancement; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Image converted from PIL to NumPy array -> processed by model -> output converted back to PIL Image.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'retinaface' within the function is unusual but benign; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image enhancement with proper resource management via threading lock. The import of 'retinaface' inside the function is a workaround for a known bug, not malicious. No network activity, secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-driven, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
