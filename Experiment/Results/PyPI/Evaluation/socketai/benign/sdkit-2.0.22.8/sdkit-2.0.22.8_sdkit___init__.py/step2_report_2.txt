  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes device management, VRAM, and compatibility polyfill.\n- **Anomalies:** Replaces built-in `staticmethod` with a custom class for Python <3.9 — unusual but justified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The staticmethod patch is for compatibility, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the staticmethod patch as unconventional but benign. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar device configuration focus.\n- **Anomalies:** Same staticmethod patch, justified as a compatibility polyfill.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Device and VRAM management, with version compatibility.\n- **Anomalies:** Staticmethod patch for Python <3.9, again justified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no network or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The staticmethod patch is a compatibility workaround, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar device and VRAM configuration.\n- **Anomalies:** Same staticmethod patch for compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external threats.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Device management, VRAM, compatibility patches.\n- **Anomalies:** Staticmethod patch for older Python versions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, no data exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0. This code is clear, with extensive comments and no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2). The only unusual aspect is the patching of `staticmethod` in builtins for Python <3.9, which is a compatibility workaround, not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and well-documented.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal risk, primarily due to the unconventional staticmethod patch, which is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign utility for device and VRAM configuration with a compatibility patch. No security threat or malware present.",
