  "purpose": "Import the 'apply_filters' function from a local module within the package.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a relative module, which does not read external input directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow is apparent; the code only imports a function without executing it.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import of 'apply_filters' from a local module. It contains no execution logic, data handling, or external communication. The minimal structure and standard import statement do not indicate malicious intent. Without additional context or execution, no malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger module or package, and on its own, it poses no threat.",
