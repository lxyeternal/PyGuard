  "purpose": "Import the 'apply_filters' function from a local module, likely for data processing or filtering purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data sources are explicitly read in this code snippet; the code only performs an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; this code does not handle or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs in this single line of import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a relative module, which is common in Python projects. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks in this single statement. Without additional context or code, it's not possible to identify any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be part of a normal project structure.",
