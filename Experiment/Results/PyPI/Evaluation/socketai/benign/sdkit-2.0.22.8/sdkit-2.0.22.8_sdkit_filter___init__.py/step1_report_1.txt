{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'apply_filters' function from a local module, likely for processing or filtering data within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The source is the local module '.apply_filters', which is imported into this script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code snippet; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this single import statement; it simply imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a single import statement; there are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only a local import of a function named 'apply_filters'. This suggests that the script's purpose is to utilize filtering functions, possibly on input data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not include any input handling, network operations, or other potentially dangerous operations. The presence of only an import statement indicates standard practice in modular Python code.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a simple, benign import of a function from a local module, with no malicious or suspicious activity evident.",
