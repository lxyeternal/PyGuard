  "purpose": "This code imports the 'apply_filters' function from a local module, likely for use within a larger application or processing pipeline.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the only source; no data input or external data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import does not involve data transfer or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module, with no execution, data handling, or external communication. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. Given the lack of any suspicious activity or complexity, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary based on this snippet.",
