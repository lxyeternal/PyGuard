  "purpose": "Provides functions to apply image filters via dynamic module import, with a fallback to a default model application.",
  "sources": "filter_type input parameter, context.models dictionary, base64_str_to_img function",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no network or file operations observed",
  "flows": "filter_type input determines module import; apply_filter_single_image calls get_filter_module, which imports modules based on filter_type; fallback applies model from context",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import limited to a whitelist; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled dynamic module loading based on a predefined whitelist, reducing risk of malicious module injection. It processes images provided as base64 strings or PIL.Image objects, applying filters sequentially. The fallback applies a trusted model from the context. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The main potential risk lies in external manipulation of filter_type, but the whitelist mitigates this. The code is straightforward, readable, and does not contain suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the dynamic import based on external input, but this is controlled via a whitelist. The overall security risk is low.",
