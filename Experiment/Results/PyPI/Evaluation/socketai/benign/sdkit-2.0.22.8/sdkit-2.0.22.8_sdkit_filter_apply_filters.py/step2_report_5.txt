  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code loads known modules from a whitelist, reducing risk of malicious module injection. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation detected. The default fallback is a simple model invocation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, risk=0.2 — reasonable, given the controlled dynamic import but some minimal risk if filter_type is manipulated.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing controlled dynamic import. No network activity or data leaks. The default model invocation is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, assuming trusted modules.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, controlled dynamic import with a predefined list. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher concern due to dynamic import based on user input. Potential risk if filter_type is malicious, but no actual malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3, risk=0.3 — slightly higher, reflecting the increased concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Caution warranted if filter_type input is untrusted, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, controlled local module loading. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, risk=0.1 — very low.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malware (0). The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports report 0, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, with most around 0.2, and one at 0.3, due to dynamic import based on external input.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The dynamic import mechanism is limited to a predefined whitelist, significantly reducing risk.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The default fallback is benign.\n- The main concern is if `filter_type` is manipulated externally, potentially leading to unintended module import. However, the code's design mitigates this by limiting modules.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minimal, based on potential for external manipulation of filter_type, but overall low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe and legitimate for its purpose. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the dynamic import is controlled. The minor risk score accounts for the potential if input validation is not enforced elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided in all reports.",
