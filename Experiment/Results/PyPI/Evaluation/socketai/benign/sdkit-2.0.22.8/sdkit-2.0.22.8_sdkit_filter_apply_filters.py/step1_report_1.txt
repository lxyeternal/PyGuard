{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to apply various image filters, dynamically importing modules based on filter type, and processing images provided as base64 strings or PIL images.",
  "sources": "The code reads input images (possibly base64-encoded strings or PIL images) passed to apply_filters or apply_filter_single_image functions.",
  "sinks": "The code applies filters via dynamically imported modules or default models, which could potentially process untrusted images or data, but there are no explicit sinks leading to external systems or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input images are converted from base64 if needed, then processed through get_filter_module, which either imports a module or defaults to a model call, applying filters sequentially.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. Dynamic module import uses input filter_type but is limited to known modules, reducing risk. No obfuscated code, network communication, or file manipulation present.",
  "analysis": "The code safely manages input images and dynamically loads filter modules based on a whitelist. The import mechanism is controlled and limited to predefined modules, reducing the risk of malicious module injection. The default behavior simply applies a model from the context. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions are detected. The functions are straightforward and do not contain obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, the code appears to be for legitimate image processing purposes with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe image filtering utility that dynamically loads known modules or defaults to provided models. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured with controlled dynamic imports and no suspicious data flows.",
