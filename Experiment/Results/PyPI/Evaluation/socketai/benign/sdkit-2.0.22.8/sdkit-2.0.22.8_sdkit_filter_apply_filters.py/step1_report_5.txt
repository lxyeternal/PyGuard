{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to apply various image filters by dynamically importing modules based on filter types and processing images either from base64 strings or PIL.Image objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input images (base64 strings or PIL.Image objects) and filter type identifiers, and accesses context models for default filters.",
  "sinks": "The code applies filters via dynamically imported modules or default models, and calls external functions like log.info() and gc().",
  "flows": "Input images are converted and passed to filter modules or default models; filter_type strings are used to import modules; modules process images and return results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no suspicious dynamic code execution; no unusual variable names or obfuscation. The use of importlib for dynamic imports is standard but warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dynamic module loading based on filter names, image processing, and logging. It imports filter modules securely from local packages; uses safe mechanisms to handle input images and filter identifiers; defaults to a safe fallback if modules are missing. No indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The dynamic import mechanism relies on a predefined whitelist of filter names, reducing risk. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are observed. Logging and garbage collection calls are standard for resource management.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a controlled image processing utility with no malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard image filtering pipeline that dynamically loads local filter modules and applies them to images. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is safe for use, assuming the filter modules themselves are secure and trustworthy.",
