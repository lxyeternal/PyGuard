{
  "purpose": "Provides pytest fixtures and classes for printing formatted test progress messages, including timing and indentation features.",
  "sources": "Reads pytest configuration options and internal plugin manager APIs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted messages via pytest's terminal reporter using write_line.",
  "flows": "Configuration options influence creation of printer objects; printers generate formatted messages; messages are sent to pytest's reporter.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no external network or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest plugin module for enhanced test output formatting. It uses pytest's plugin system, fixtures, and internal APIs to create printer objects that output formatted messages. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The implementation is straightforward, relying solely on standard Python and pytest mechanisms. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The code's purpose is purely for improving test output readability and verbosity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. It is a standard pytest plugin for formatted message printing during tests. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
