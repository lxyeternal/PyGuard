{
  "purpose": "Provides pytest plugins for printing test progress and formatting messages during test execution.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (sys, timeit, typing, dataclasses), pytest plugin hooks, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "The code calls write_line on the TerminalReporter object, which outputs messages to the console or terminal.",
  "flows": "Input from pytest configuration and command line options influences the creation of Printer and PrettyPrinter objects, which format and print messages during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected. Use of replace() for formatting is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious logic identified. The code merely formats and outputs messages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines pytest fixtures and classes for printing and formatting messages during test runs, with configurable options via command-line flags. It uses standard pytest plugin APIs and safe string formatting. No external network access, file manipulation, or other suspicious activities are present. The message formatting and printing are straightforward, and the code does not perform any data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest plugin implementation for printing test progress with configurable formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply facilitates message output during testing.",
