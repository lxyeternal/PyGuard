  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the provided code and its associated assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import and variable assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. Confirmed: no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware and securityRisk are 0, which is appropriate. Obfuscated is 0, which makes sense.\n- **Justification for scores:** Since the code is benign and standard, scores are justified.\n- **Overall:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no issues found.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws in reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Malware and securityRisk are 0; appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, so the scores are justified.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correct reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Malware and securityRisk are 0; consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code remains a benign configuration snippet.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues; code is straightforward.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.\n- **Scores:** Malware and securityRisk are 0; justified.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.\n- **Scores:** Malware and securityRisk are 0; appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\nAll reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, any higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard, harmless configuration snippet for pytest with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
