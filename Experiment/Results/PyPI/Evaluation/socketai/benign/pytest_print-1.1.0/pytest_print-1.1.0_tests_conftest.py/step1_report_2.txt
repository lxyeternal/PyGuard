{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a plugin configuration for pytest testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports the __future__ annotations feature and defines a pytest_plugins variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. The use of __future__ import is common in Python 3.7+ for postponed evaluation of annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __future__.annotations feature, which is used for forward references in type annotations, and sets a variable for pytest plugins. There are no embedded or hidden behaviors, no external data handling, and no malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and appears to be a configuration snippet for testing setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration for pytest plugins, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
