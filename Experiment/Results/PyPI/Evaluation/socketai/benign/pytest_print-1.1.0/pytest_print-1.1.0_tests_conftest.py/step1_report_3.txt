  "purpose": "The code is configuring the pytest testing framework by importing future annotations support and setting a plugin for pytest.",
  "sources": "Import statement for __future__ annotations, assignment of pytest_plugins list",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only sets configuration variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for pytest configuration",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature to support postponed evaluation of annotations, which is a common practice in modern Python. It also assigns a pytest plugin for testing purposes. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for a testing setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration code for pytest with no malicious behavior detected.",
