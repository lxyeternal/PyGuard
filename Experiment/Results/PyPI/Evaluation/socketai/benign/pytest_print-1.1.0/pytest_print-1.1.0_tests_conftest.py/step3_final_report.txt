  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, and assigns a list with 'pytester' to pytest_plugins. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code is a typical configuration snippet with no obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for pytest setup, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0.",
