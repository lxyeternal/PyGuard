  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is a simple import of `__future__.annotations` and setting `pytest_plugins`.\n- No external data, no data flows, no sinks.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — all appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same code pattern, standard pytest plugin setup.\n- No data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Identical code purpose and structure.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** all zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same minimal setup.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same straightforward configuration.\n- No anomalies.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- The code in all reports is standard, benign, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no potential for security issues.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and reasoning.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and well-justified.**",
