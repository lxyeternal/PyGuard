{
  "purpose": "The code sets up future annotations for compatibility and specifies a pytest plugin for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature from the future module to enable annotations syntax compatibility, and assigns a list to 'pytest_plugins' for plugin registration in pytest. Both are standard and benign practices in Python testing modules. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for Python testing, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
