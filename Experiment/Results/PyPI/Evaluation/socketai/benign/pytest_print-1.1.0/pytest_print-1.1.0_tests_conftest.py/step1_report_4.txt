{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple configuration or setup file, primarily intended to declare future import behaviors and specify pytest plugins for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statements and plugin declaration, which do not involve user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling, output, or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present; the code does not process or transfer data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for test configuration files; no unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the future annotations feature, which modifies Python's type hinting behavior, and declares a pytest plugin list. Both are typical for test setup scripts and do not perform any data processing or malicious actions. No anomalies, external data handling, or suspicious logic are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard purpose for test configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
