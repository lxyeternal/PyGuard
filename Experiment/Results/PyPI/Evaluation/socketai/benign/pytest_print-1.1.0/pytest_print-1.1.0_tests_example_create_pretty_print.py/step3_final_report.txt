{
  "purpose": "The code sets up pytest fixtures and test functions for a pretty-printing utility, simulating delays with sleep calls, primarily for testing and debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function calls, fixture setup, and print statements within test functions.",
  "sinks": "The print statements output formatted logs; no untrusted data flows or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Sources (function calls, fixture setup) lead to print outputs; sleep calls are delays, not data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign pytest testing setup involving formatting and simulated delays. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of sleep is for simulation, not malicious intent. The print statements are for debugging output. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The overall structure and logic are standard for testing utilities, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
