{
  "purpose": "The code defines test functions for pytest, including fixtures, string manipulation, and output verification, focusing on printing formatted test results.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings for float pattern replacement, and test results from pytest execution.",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted external input; mainly processes internal test outputs.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by fix_floats_in_relative_time; test execution results are analyzed for output matching.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior observed. The code appears to be straightforward test-related scripting.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, uses pytest fixtures, and performs string replacements and assertions to verify test output formatting. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The string replacement function substitutes float patterns with a static value, which is benign. All code operates within the context of test validation and output formatting, with no evident malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script for pytest output validation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
