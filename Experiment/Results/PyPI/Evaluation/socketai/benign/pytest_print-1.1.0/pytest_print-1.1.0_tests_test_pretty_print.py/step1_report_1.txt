{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of test functions for a pytest-based testing framework, focusing on printing test progress and timing information.",
  "sources": "Reads input from test files 'example_pretty_print.py' via seed_test function, and from pytest runtime outputs.",
  "sinks": "Output processing functions such as extract_printer_text and print output comparisons; no direct sinks for untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "Test execution generates output; extract_printer_text processes output; fix_floats_in_relative_time sanitizes floating point numbers; assertions compare sanitized output to expected strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed. The use of regex substitution to replace floats is benign and intended for test output normalization.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily test setup and validation functions, with no dynamic input handling, network operations, or file manipulations beyond test fixtures. The code uses standard testing and string processing techniques. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is present. The only transformation is replacing floating point numbers with a fixed value, which is a benign normalization step. Overall, the code functions as part of test validation and output comparison, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite component for pytest, performing output validation and normalization. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
