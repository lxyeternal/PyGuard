{
  "purpose": "The code implements pytest test functions for verifying output formatting and timing, including normalization of floating-point timestamps for consistent test results.",
  "sources": "Test fixtures, pytest output, and string processing functions that read and manipulate test output data.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks; output is processed internally for validation purposes.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke pytest, capture output, normalize floating-point numbers via regex, and compare against expected strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to replace floating-point numbers with a fixed value ('0.1') for normalization is benign; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite for output validation, involving no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The normalization step is intended for consistent test results and does not introduce security risks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely to verify output formatting, and all signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test suite with no malicious intent or security issues. The normalization step is harmless. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, consistent with the analysis.",
