{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest test functions designed to run and verify the output of a test suite that prints formatted messages, including relative timestamps.",
  "sources": "The code reads test configuration and results data from pytest's testing framework and test files.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior, outputs are generated from fixed test data and functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from pytest runs and regex processing flow into output comparison functions; no external untrusted data flows into critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The functions perform standard regex replacements and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test fixtures and test functions for pytest, focusing on formatting and printing test output. The regex is used to replace floating-point numbers in the output, which is safe. The code operates solely on internal test data and results. No network operations, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard testing code without malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign pytest testing script that processes and verifies test output formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
