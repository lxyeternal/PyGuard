{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a test suite for verifying the output formatting of pytest test results with custom print statements and relative time annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from test fixtures, function parameters, and output from pytest runs.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and compares output text; no data sinks involve untrusted external data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input fixtures → pytest execution → output extraction and normalization → comparison with expected output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. The code primarily deals with regex substitutions and test output validation. No network activity, file operations, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and testing libraries, sets up fixtures for test data, and runs pytest with specific flags. It processes the output to replace floating-point numbers with a fixed value for comparison, indicating normalization rather than malicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of regex for float replacement is a benign normalization step for testing purposes. Overall, the code is straightforward test code without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, purpose-built test suite for verifying formatted test output. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code functions solely within a testing context without external system interactions.",
