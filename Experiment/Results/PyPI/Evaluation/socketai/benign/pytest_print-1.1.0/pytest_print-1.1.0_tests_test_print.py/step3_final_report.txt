{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest test functions verifying output formatting, environment variable manipulation, and timing in test runs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, test fixtures, and static test files used during pytest execution.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no network, file, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, test files) influence test output and timing assertions, but no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code patterns detected; environment variable manipulations are standard in testing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of standard pytest test cases focused on output validation and timing. No network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution are involved. The environment variable modifications are typical for controlling test behavior. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0.1), with high confidence. The code's clarity and lack of external data flows support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward pytest test suite with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
