{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of pytest test functions and fixtures used for testing a Python project's output formatting and execution flow.",
  "sources": "Code reads from imported modules (pytest, tests), and test input files ('example_print.py') via fixtures and test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; output assertions check for specific strings in test results.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke pytest runs, capture output, and compare output lines; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script is solely a set of unit tests verifying output content and formatting of other test runs. It does not execute untrusted input, perform dynamic code execution, or access sensitive data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for verifying pytest output formatting and behavior. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks identified.",
