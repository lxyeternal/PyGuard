{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based test functions for output verification, formatting, and progress reporting, with no external data sources or system modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from test fixtures and internal functions; no untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems or files; output is processed internally for test assertions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test fixtures and functions through regex manipulations and assertions, with no external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs; regex used for benign output formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard pytest test functions, fixtures, and string processing routines. No external data handling, network calls, or malicious code are present. Regex is used solely for formatting purposes. The code's purpose is purely testing and output validation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, and confidence is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
