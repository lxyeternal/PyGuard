{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of pytest test functions designed to run and verify various test scenarios with different output formats and timing information.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include pytest command-line arguments, test files, and pytest internal test result data.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via pytest's result.outlines and result assertions; no direct data sinks such as network or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Input command-line arguments → pytest execution → test result generation → output extraction and formatting for assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code performs standard testing and string manipulation with regex and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and testing libraries, defines fixtures and test functions, and performs output validation. The function fix_floats_in_relative_time sanitizes floating-point numbers in output for comparison consistency. All operations involve test execution, output extraction, and string comparisons. There are no external data sources or sinks, nor any code execution based on untrusted inputs. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or supply chain threats are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test suite for pytest with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code performs standard testing operations, output formatting, and assertions. No suspicious or malicious activity is present.",
