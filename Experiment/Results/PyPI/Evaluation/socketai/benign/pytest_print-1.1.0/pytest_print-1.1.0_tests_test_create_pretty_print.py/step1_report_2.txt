{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a set of pytest-based test scripts for a Python testing framework, including fixtures, test cases, and utility functions for output processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads test files ('example_create_pretty_print.py') and test execution output from pytest runs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that execute untrusted data; output is mainly printed or returned as strings.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly executes tests and manipulates strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard testing and regex functions, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily involves setting up pytest fixtures, running tests, capturing output, and processing text outputs. The functions are straightforward, with no external data inputs, network communication, or file manipulations that could be malicious. The regex replacement is for formatting purposes only. The test functions assert expected test outcomes and output content. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest testing script designed for output verification and formatting. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on its content and structure.",
