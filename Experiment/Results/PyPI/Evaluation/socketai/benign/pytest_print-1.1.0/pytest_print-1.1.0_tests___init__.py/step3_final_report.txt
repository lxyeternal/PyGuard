  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting formatted test output and copying test files into a temporary directory for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading input lines in extract_printer_text; reading source file in seed_test.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "extract_printer_text processes input lines with regex and string replacements; seed_test copies a file from source to destination.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard library usage, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string filtering and file copying using standard libraries, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. Regex substitutions are safe and typical for formatting. File operations are standard for test setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for test setup and output processing, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, reflecting its harmless nature.",
