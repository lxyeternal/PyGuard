  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Two functions:\n  - `extract_printer_text`: processes a list of strings, removing separator lines, slicing from a specific substring, regex substitution to remove percentages, replacing substrings, and cleaning whitespace.\n  - `seed_test`: copies a specified file into a pytest temporary directory, asserting the source exists.\n- Uses standard libraries (`re`, `pathlib`, `shutil`) and type hints.\n- No network, system commands, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n- Purpose appears to be test utility functions for extracting formatted test output and setting up test files.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and performs as intended.\n- **Security concerns:** No evidence of data leaks, untrusted data flows, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware or obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None evident; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or security flaws detected.\n- The only minor note is that `extract_printer_text` assumes specific patterns in test output, but this is typical for test utilities and not a security concern.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0 or very close to 0 — no vulnerabilities detected.\n- **Risk:** 0 or very close to 0 — the functions are benign.\n\nSome reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0.1, possibly to reflect minimal filesystem interaction, but given the benign nature, this is not justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- File copying and string processing are standard testing utilities.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their conclusion: the code is benign.\n- The scores are generally aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is a simple utility module with no suspicious behavior.\n- The only slight concern might be the file copying, but in a testing context, this is standard and safe.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is benign.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the reports' assessments that the code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The risk score should remain at 0.**",
