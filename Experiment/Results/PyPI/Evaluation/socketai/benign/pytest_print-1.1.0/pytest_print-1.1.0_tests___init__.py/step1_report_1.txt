  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting specific text from test output and setting up test files.",
  "sources": "Reads from a file path (__file__ and filename), and uses test data from pytest Testdir (testdir.tmpdir).",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or untrusted data effects. No network or system commands are used.",
  "flows": "File is read to copy a test script; the output is processed in extract_printer_text but no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; functions perform standard file handling, string processing, and copying.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one extracts and processes text lines, and the other copies a test file to a temporary directory. It uses standard libraries (re, pathlib, shutil) and type hints. The extraction function removes specific lines, slices output, and replaces certain substrings, which appears to be for formatting test output. The seed_test function copies a specified file into a pytest temporary directory, asserting its existence. No hardcoded credentials, network access, or malicious code patterns are present. There are no obfuscated parts or code that executes untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward utility for testing purposes with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs file copying and string manipulation without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
