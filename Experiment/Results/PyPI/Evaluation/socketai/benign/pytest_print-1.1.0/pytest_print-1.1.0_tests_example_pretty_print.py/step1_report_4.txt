{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test function for a PrettyPrinter class, demonstrating indentation and message output functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'pretty_printer' parameter, which is used to output messages and create indented printers.",
  "sinks": "The 'pretty_printer' outputs messages; these could be considered sinks if the data was untrusted, but in this context, it is a testing utility.",
  "flows": "Input data (calls to pretty_printer and its methods) flows to output via the printer objects; no external untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward test code for a printing utility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations and typing modules, conditionally imports a PrettyPrinter class for type checking, and defines a test function that exercises printing and indentation methods. All operations are limited to printing messages, with no external data processing or network activity. The structure is simple and typical for unit tests.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a unit test for a PrettyPrinter utility. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security issues are evident. It appears to be benign test code for debugging or demonstration purposes.",
