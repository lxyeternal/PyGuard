{
  "purpose": "This code is a test function that demonstrates the usage of a PrettyPrinter class or function to produce indented, icon-labeled output for testing or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'pretty_printer' parameter, which is a PrettyPrinter object, and from the method calls like 'pretty_printer.indent'.",
  "sinks": "Output functions called on 'pretty_printer' and its indented variants, which produce visible output; no untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the 'pretty_printer' object to its 'indent' method, and then to the printing or output functions invoked via the returned objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward usage of a printer object; no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type checking features and defines a test function that relies on a 'PrettyPrinter' object. The function demonstrates nested indentation with icons and outputs messages at various indentation levels. All operations are typical for debugging or testing print formatting. There are no external data inputs, no network connections, no file operations, and no manipulation of sensitive data. The code appears to be a simple test scenario, with no signs of malicious activity or malicious behavior. The usage of type hints and the 'if TYPE_CHECKING' guard suggests a development environment focus rather than production malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless test function demonstrating PrettyPrinter usage, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs standard debugging output with no suspicious behavior.",
