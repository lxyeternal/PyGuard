  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward test function demonstrating the usage of a PrettyPrinter class.\n- No external data input, network activity, or data manipulation is involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code uses standard Python features, with type hints and conditional imports for type checking.\n- The purpose appears to be for testing or demonstrating formatting features, not for malicious activity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious actions, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n   - The code only outputs formatted messages with indentation and icons, which are benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - The logic is consistent and correct for a test scenario.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` guard and type hints is appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Some reports assign a very low security risk (~0.1), which is reasonable given the context (test code).\n   - The overall risk scores are very low, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Malware and obfuscated scores:**\n   - Both are correctly set to 0, as no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n   - No reason to increase these scores.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, straightforward test code demonstrating a formatting utility.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as a minimal caution for test code, but not a real risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no further concerns or adjustments are necessary.",
