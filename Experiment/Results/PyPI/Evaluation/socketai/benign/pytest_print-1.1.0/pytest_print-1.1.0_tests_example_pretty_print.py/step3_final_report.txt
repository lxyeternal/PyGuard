{
  "purpose": "The code is a test function demonstrating the usage of a PrettyPrinter utility with indentation and icon customization, primarily for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only calls methods on a provided PrettyPrinter object.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code only performs printing operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the PrettyPrinter object method calls to the console output; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and readable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple test demonstrating indentation and icon features of a PrettyPrinter class. It involves no external data, network activity, or malicious constructs. The use of emojis as icons is benign. The logic is correct, and there are no security issues or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a demonstration or test of a formatting utility. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
