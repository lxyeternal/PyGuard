{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a test function for a PrettyPrinter class, intended to demonstrate usage of indentation and custom icons for formatted printing.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'pretty_printer' object passed as a parameter, which is used for output.",
  "sinks": "The 'pretty_printer' object is used to output data; no untrusted data input or data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'pretty_printer' object to output functions with various indentations and icons, but no untrusted data or external calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code uses only standard features and a custom object for printing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations and typing modules, then defines a test function that utilizes a 'PrettyPrinter' object for formatted output. The function performs multiple print calls with indentation and icon customization, demonstrating usage rather than executing malicious actions. There are no external network calls, data manipulations, or security-sensitive operations observed. The code seems purely for testing or demonstrating formatting capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code simply tests a printing utility's features. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
