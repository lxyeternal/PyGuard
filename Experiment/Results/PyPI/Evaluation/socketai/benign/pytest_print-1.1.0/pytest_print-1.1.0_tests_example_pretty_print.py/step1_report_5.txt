{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test function designed to demonstrate and verify the usage of a PrettyPrinter class or function for formatted, indented printing in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the parameter 'pretty_printer' passed into the test function, which is an instance of PrettyPrinter. It also uses string literals for icons and messages.",
  "sinks": "The 'pretty_printer' callable and its 'indent' method are used to output messages. These outputs are not directly sensitive or untrusted in the context of this code; no data is being written to external systems or files, and no untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "The source 'pretty_printer' is called to produce output; the 'indent' method creates indented printer instances, which are then used to output indented messages. There are no transformations or data flows that lead to security concerns.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The usage of emoji icons is benign and likely for visual formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations, defines a test function using a fixture 'pretty_printer', and performs a series of print calls with indentation. The logic is straightforward, demonstrating nested indentation capabilities of the PrettyPrinter object. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The code is simple, clean, and appears to serve as a test or demonstration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script that exercises the features of a PrettyPrinter object for formatted output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
