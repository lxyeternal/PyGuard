  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. It performs version checking, logging, and request handling as expected.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — very low, considering the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion matches the code. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior. The only minor concern is logging sensitive info if secrets are included, but currently, it logs only event metadata.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher, acknowledging potential logging concerns.\n\n- **Justification:** The analysis is thorough. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, it describes a standard API client with proper request handling, no obfuscation, no backdoors, and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — same as previous, acknowledging minor logging or outdated practices.\n\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a legitimate API client with no signs of malicious activity. The only note is the deprecated async method, which is standard but outdated.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — very low.\n\n- **Justification:** The code is standard, with no malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor note is the use of deprecated async code, which does not imply malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Risk: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly around 0.1-0.2, mainly considering potential logging of sensitive data and outdated practices. These are minor and do not indicate security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** I would assign a **risk score of 0.1** to reflect the minor concerns about logging practices and deprecated async code, but overall, the code is quite safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | **0**          |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**          |\n| Risk           | **0.1**        |\n\nThe code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The minor risk is due to outdated async code and potential logging concerns, but these are not security threats.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure logging does not include sensitive data like auth tokens in production environments.",
