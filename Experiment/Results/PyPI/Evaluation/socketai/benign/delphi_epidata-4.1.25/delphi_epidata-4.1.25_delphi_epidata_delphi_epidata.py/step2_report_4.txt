  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client, no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity. Version check contacts PyPI, which is normal.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk score (0.1) reflects minimal concern, consistent with the code's behavior. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Notes that logs could leak secrets if misused but currently do not.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough. The slightly higher risk score (0.2) accounts for potential privacy issues if logs are misconfigured, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API client, no code injection, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. Uses standard modules, handles errors gracefully.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on request construction, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity. Mentions deprecated async method but considers it standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Well justified. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same overall conclusion—standard API client, no malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious activities—no backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.2, mainly due to logging practices and external version checks, which are standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to potential log leaks and external version check, both standard practices)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type   | Final Estimate |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0              |\n| Obfuscated   | 0              |\n| Security Risk| 0.1            |\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and integrity based on the provided source and reports.",
