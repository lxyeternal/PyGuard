  "purpose": "This module provides an interface to DELPHI's Epidata API for fetching epidemiological data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from parameters passed to various static methods, external modules such as requests, time, asyncio, tenacity, and aiohttp, and from environment variables via sys.stderr for logging.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows from user-supplied method parameters (e.g., auth tokens, data request parameters) into API request payloads; responses from the API are returned as JSON or text, which could be exploited if maliciously crafted. Logging outputs are sent to standard error, which is generally safe but could leak sensitive information if logs include secrets.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., auth tokens, request parameters) are used to build API request URLs and payloads, which are then sent over HTTP requests. API responses are parsed and returned. The deprecated async method sends data asynchronously using aiohttp, with parameters and responses flowing through async functions. Sensitive parameters like auth tokens are included in request headers or body as specified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The version check contacts an external server, which could be a privacy concern, but is not malicious. The logging method outputs to sys.stderr with string formatting; if any sensitive data (like auth tokens) are included in logs, it could be a privacy risk. The code performs no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution. The deprecated async method uses asyncio and aiohttp correctly, no malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a client wrapper for an epidemiological API, constructing requests based on user inputs, handling responses, and logging events. The version check contacts PyPI to verify client version, which is standard. There are no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The request functions handle errors gracefully. Logging outputs to stderr could leak sensitive info if secrets are logged, but currently, only event metadata is logged. The code relies on standard modules and libraries; no obfuscation or malicious code constructs are detected. External requests are limited to version checking and API calls; no data exfiltration or system manipulation is performed. The only potential concern is logging potentially sensitive information if logs are misconfigured, but this is a common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client library for epidemiological data. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The only minor concern is the possibility of logging sensitive data if parameters include secrets, but the code as-is does not explicitly log such secrets. Overall, it appears secure and functional without malicious intent.",
