  "purpose": "A module for DELPHI's Epidata API, providing functions to fetch various epidemiological datasets and metadata.",
  "sources": "Requests to external API endpoints, version check via PyPI, logging events, and handling input parameters.",
  "sinks": "External network requests, version check to PyPI, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (parameters, version check) lead to API requests and logging; responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of deprecated async method noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client with standard request handling, error management, and version checking. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. External requests are limited to version checks and data fetching, with proper input validation. Logging is used for diagnostics but does not contain sensitive data. The deprecated async method is a technical note, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, transparent API client with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor concerns are related to outdated async code and potential logging practices, which are not security issues. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
