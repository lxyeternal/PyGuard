  "purpose": "A Python module providing an interface to DELPHI's Epidata API for various public health data.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, environment variables, and external API requests.",
  "sinks": "External API calls, potential network communications, data returned from requests.",
  "flows": "Function parameters are processed and used to build request parameters, which are then sent via HTTP requests; responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard API interaction code. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors found.",
  "analysis": "The code provides methods to fetch various health datasets from an external API, with input validation and request handling. It performs version checking from PyPI, logs events, and manages requests with retries. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity is evident. External modules are used appropriately. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious injections, or sabotage. Usage of requests, asyncio, and tenacity is standard for such API clients. The deprecation warning for an async method is normal. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client for health data, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs typical patterns for request handling, retries, and logging. No malware or security risks are identified based on the source code.",
