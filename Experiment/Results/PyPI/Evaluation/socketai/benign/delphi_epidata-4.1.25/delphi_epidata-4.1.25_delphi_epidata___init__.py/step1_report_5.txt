  "purpose": "The code imports classes and variables from a local module named 'delphi_epidata' and sets a package name.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module: from .delphi_epidata import Epidata, __version__",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing and defining a string variable; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs an import from a local module and defines a package name. There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or embedded logic. The import is from a relative module, which is typical for package internal structure. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable usage, or malicious constructs are evident. The code appears to be a standard module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It is part of normal package initialization or structure.",
