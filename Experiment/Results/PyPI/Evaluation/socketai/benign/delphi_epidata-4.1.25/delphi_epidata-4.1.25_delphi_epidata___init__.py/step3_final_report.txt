  "purpose": "Import specific classes and version information from a local module within the package.",
  "sources": "Relative import from .delphi_epidata module, accessing Epidata and __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leakage or external communication",
  "flows": "Import statement loads local module components; variable assignment sets a string value",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and variable assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a relative import from a local module and assigning a string to a variable. No external data, network activity, or user input is involved. The import is from a local package component, which is standard in Python projects. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import with no malicious intent or security risks. The current assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
