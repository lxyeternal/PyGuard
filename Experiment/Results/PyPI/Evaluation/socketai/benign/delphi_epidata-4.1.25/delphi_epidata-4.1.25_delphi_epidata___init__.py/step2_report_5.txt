  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims and scores, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a minimal import statement: `from .delphi_epidata import Epidata, __version__` and a package name assignment.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or complex logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or anomalies.\n\n**Step 2: Review each report's reasoning and scores**\n\nAll reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with consistent reasoning. They assign:\n\n- Purpose: straightforward import and package name declaration.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: none, as expected.\n- Anomalies: none.\n- Analysis: correct, minimal, standard practice.\n- Conclusion: benign, no security risks.\n\nScores:\n\n- Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (none)\n- Malware: 0 (none)\n- SecurityRisk: 0 (none)\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the code snippet.\n\n**Step 3: Cross-validate the scores**\n\n- Malware score: 0 is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated: 0 is justified; code is straightforward.\n- Security risk: 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Step 4: Challenge any assumptions or claims**\n\n- The code is minimal and standard; no hidden behavior.\n- Importing from a local module does not inherently pose security risks unless the module itself is malicious, but this is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Step 5: Final assessment**\n\nGiven the consistent analysis and scores, I agree with the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign import statement with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code snippet is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
