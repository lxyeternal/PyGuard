{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exceptions and an interface for a DateTime object with various methods for date/time manipulation and formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (`zope.interface`) and defines method signatures, but does not read external input or data directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input; the code only specifies method signatures and class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists within this code snippet as it contains only class and method signatures without implementations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard interface definition with no implementation or logic; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior are present. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clean, straightforward definition of exceptions and an interface for date/time manipulation, formatting, and comparison. It imports a known library (`zope.interface`) and specifies method signatures without any implementation details. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger library or framework, providing method signatures for date/time objects, with no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign interface definition intended for date/time handling within a framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. It is safe and appears to be part of a larger, well-structured library.",
