{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of exception classes and an interface for a DateTime object, outlining methods for date/time manipulation, comparison, formatting, and conversion.",
  "sources": "The code primarily sources data from method parameters and internal object states. No external data inputs or user input sources are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data are present. The code defines interface methods without implementations that might process untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "There are no concrete data flows involving untrusted data; method definitions suggest intended usage but do not implement actual data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code appears to be standard interface and exception class definitions, with comprehensive method documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes for date/time errors and an interface for a DateTime object. It includes detailed method signatures for date/time operations, comparisons, formatting, and conversions. There is no implementation, and no data processing or external interactions are coded here. The code is consistent with standard Python practices for defining interfaces and custom exceptions. No suspicious or malicious activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. The design is purely declarative, outlining expected functionalities without executing any logic.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard set of interface and exception class definitions for a DateTime object, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, contain hardcoded secrets, or implement suspicious behaviors. It appears safe and intended for use as a contract for DateTime implementations.",
