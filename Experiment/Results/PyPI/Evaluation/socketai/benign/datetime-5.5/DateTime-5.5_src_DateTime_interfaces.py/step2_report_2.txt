  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes and a DateTime interface.\n- Data flow: No actual data processing, just method signatures.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard interface.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** This is purely interface and exception class definitions with no implementation or executable code. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining exceptions and an interface.\n- Data flow: No direct data input, just method signatures.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Standard, safe interface.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above; no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines exceptions and an IDateTime interface.\n- Data flow: No direct data reading or external input handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Typical interface definition, safe.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar interface and exception definitions.\n- Data flow: No external data input or processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard interface.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as others—interface and exception classes.\n- Data flow: No external data input or processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Standard, safe code.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code content:** All reports describe interface and exception class definitions for a DateTime object. There are no implementations, data processing, or external interactions.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially negligible; these are standard interface definitions.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, as it's just an interface definition with no execution or data handling)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a set of interface and exception class definitions for date/time handling, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. It is safe, well-structured, and typical for such a purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned by the reports are consistent with my analysis. There is no need to adjust them upward, as there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
