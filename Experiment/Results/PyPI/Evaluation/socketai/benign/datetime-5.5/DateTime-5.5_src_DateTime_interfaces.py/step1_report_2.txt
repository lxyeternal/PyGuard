{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of custom exception classes and an interface for DateTime objects with various methods for date and time manipulation, comparison, formatting, and conversion.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method calls on DateTime objects and possibly external data sources when methods like localZone() or toZone() are invoked, but no direct input sources such as user input, files, or network are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that perform data formatting or comparison, but none appear to process untrusted data directly or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit source-to-sink data flows, as the code primarily defines an interface without implementations or data processing logic. Method definitions suggest data access and comparison, but no actual data flow or untrusted data handling is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are evident. The code contains extensive method signatures and documentation, typical for interface definitions, with no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward interface and exception class definitions for DateTime handling in Python, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. It serves as a contract for DateTime objects, specifying methods for date/time manipulation and comparison. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The presence of exception classes and comprehensive method signatures indicates a focus on robust date/time management, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard interface definition for DateTime objects, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as a contract or specification, not executable or data-processing code, and poses no threat.",
