{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes and an interface 'IDateTime' that specifies methods for handling date and time objects, including conversions, comparisons, and formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules ('zope.interface') and defines method signatures that suggest interaction with date/time data, but it does not read untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network communication, file writing, system command execution, or data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no explicit data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks, as this code mainly defines an interface and exception classes without implementation or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of method signatures and class definitions with no implementation, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual code patterns. The interface methods are descriptive and conventional for date/time handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a formal interface for date/time objects, including comparison and formatting methods, along with custom exceptions. It does not contain executable logic, data processing, or input/output operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is standard and adheres to typical design patterns for such interfaces. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface definition for date/time handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process untrusted data or perform any dangerous operations. The overall security risk is negligible.",
