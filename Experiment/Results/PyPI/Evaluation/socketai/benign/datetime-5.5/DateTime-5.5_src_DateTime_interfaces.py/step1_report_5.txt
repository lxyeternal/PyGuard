{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and an interface for a DateTime object with various methods for date and time manipulation, formatting, comparison, and conversion.",
  "sources": "None, as the code only contains class and method definitions without external data input.",
  "sinks": "None, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, since there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to be a straightforward interface and exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exceptions and an interface specifying method signatures for DateTime operations. There are no implementations, external data inputs, or executable code that could be exploited. The interface covers typical date/time functionalities, formatting, comparisons, and conversions, but does not perform any operations on its own. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured and standard for defining a DateTime interface in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard interface and exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing or external interactions that could be exploited. Therefore, it poses no security threat and can be considered safe.",
