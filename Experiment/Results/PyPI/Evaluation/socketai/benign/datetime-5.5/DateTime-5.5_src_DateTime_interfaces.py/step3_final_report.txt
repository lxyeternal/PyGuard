{
  "purpose": "This code defines exception classes and a comprehensive DateTime interface with method signatures for date/time manipulation, comparison, formatting, and component access, serving as a contract for DateTime implementations.",
  "sources": "Method signatures within the interface that specify data access and manipulation points; no actual data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; the code contains only method signatures without implementation or data flow.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows, as the code is purely declarative with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of class and method signatures with no implementation, data handling, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of exception classes and a detailed interface defining methods for date/time operations, comparisons, formatting, and component retrieval. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The absence of implementation indicates it is a contract rather than functional code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The method signatures are standard and do not involve any suspicious patterns or external data handling. The code's purpose is to specify an API for DateTime objects, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard interface definition for date/time handling with no malicious intent or security risks. The high risk scores assigned in the original reports are unjustified; the code itself does not pose any security threat.",
