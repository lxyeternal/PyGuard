  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a set of interface and exception class definitions with no implementation, data processing, or external interactions. It notes the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, purely declarative, and has no security risks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes that this is an interface with method signatures, no implementation, and no malicious behavior. It correctly notes the lack of data flow or untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is a set of class and method signatures, with no implementation or data processing. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, it describes a straightforward interface definition with no implementation or external data handling. No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; a standard interface and exception classes with no implementation, data flow, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative interface and exception class definitions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident in any report.\n- **Security Risk:** The overall security risk is negligible; no external data, no execution, no vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the nature of the code—interface and exception class definitions with no implementation, no data processing, no external inputs, and no suspicious patterns—the scores assigned in each report are reasonable and accurate.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe interface definition with no security concerns.",
