  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the DateTime Python module, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration without executing dynamic code or external data.",
  "sources": "Reads static files (README.rst, DateTime.txt, CHANGES.rst) for long description; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network calls, file writes, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static documentation files during setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows typical packaging conventions with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic behavior, network activity, or untrusted input handling. It only reads static files for package metadata and dependencies. The code structure is clear, and dependencies are standard. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of zero, which are justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, safe setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, no external or untrusted data processing, and poses no security risks. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
