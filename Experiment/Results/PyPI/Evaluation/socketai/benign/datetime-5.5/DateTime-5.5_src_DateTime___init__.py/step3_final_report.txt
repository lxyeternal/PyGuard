  "purpose": "A simple module that imports DateTime and Timezones from a local package and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .DateTime module",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes from a local package and defines __all__ for re-exporting. It contains only static import statements and a license header, with no data flows, external communication, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate it is a benign package initialization or re-export module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module used for organizing package exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
