{
  "purpose": "The code manages timezone data through static mappings and pytz lookups, providing timezone information and conversions without external data sources or user input influencing data beyond lookups.",
  "sources": "Timezone name strings from internal mappings and user-provided inputs in __getitem__.",
  "sinks": "Timezone objects created from lookups, with data used in info() method for retrieving offset and daylight saving info.",
  "flows": "Input timezone name strings → lookup in mappings or pytz → creation of Timezone object → info() method retrieves timezone details.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no malicious code, no hidden backdoors. Extensive static timezone mappings, some legacy, but all standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard timezone utility relying on static data and pytz. It handles timezone resolution with exception handling for unknown zones. No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no external data leaks are present. The extensive manual mappings are for compatibility and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and logic are clear and standard for timezone management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate timezone utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The security risk is very low, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score can be maintained at approximately 0.1–0.2 due to extensive static data but poses no active threat.",
