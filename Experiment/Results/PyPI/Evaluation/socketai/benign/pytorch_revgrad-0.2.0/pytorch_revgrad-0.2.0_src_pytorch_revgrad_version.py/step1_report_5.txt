  "analysis": "The code assigns a string representing the version number to the variable '__version__' and then copies this value to another variable 'version'. There are no input, output, network calls, or dynamic execution. The code appears to be standard version declaration, a common practice in Python packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
