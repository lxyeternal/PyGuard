  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code snippets are straightforward variable assignments of a version string. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network interactions, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify this as standard version declaration code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since all assessments agree that the code is benign and simple, there is no justification for raising the risk or malware scores above 0.5. The code is standard, and no malicious activity is suggested.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, writing to files, or network communication.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they rely on direct code analysis. No unwarranted claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard version declaration pattern with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- No changes needed; the current scores and assessments are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a benign, straightforward version assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
