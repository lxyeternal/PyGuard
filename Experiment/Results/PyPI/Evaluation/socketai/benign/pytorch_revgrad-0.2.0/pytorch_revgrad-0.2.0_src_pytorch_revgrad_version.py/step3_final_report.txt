{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to __version__ and copies it to version, serving as a version declaration in a Python package.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment flow: __version__ is assigned a string, then version is assigned __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic version declaration with no dynamic behavior, external interactions, or data processing. It does not read inputs, write outputs, or perform network operations. The code is clear, simple, and follows standard practice. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are accurate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless version declaration snippet with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
