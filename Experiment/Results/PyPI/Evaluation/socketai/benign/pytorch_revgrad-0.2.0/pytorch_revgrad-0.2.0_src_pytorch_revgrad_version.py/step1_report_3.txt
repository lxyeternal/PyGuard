  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Assignment flows from string to variables, no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version assignment, no obfuscation or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__ and copies it to 'version'. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution. This is a standard version declaration pattern with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
