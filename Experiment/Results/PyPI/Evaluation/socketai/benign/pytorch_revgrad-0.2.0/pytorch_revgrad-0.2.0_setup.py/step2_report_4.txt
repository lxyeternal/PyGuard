  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The provided code appears to be a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It specifies dependencies, package data, and metadata. There are no obvious malicious or suspicious code snippets, such as embedded malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are all empty responses (\"Empty response\"), which means no specific issues or concerns have been documented or identified. Without additional context or details, there's no basis to challenge or validate claims.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   Since no issues are reported, scores are likely default or zero. Without explicit scores, there's no need to suggest adjustments.\n\n4. **Risk and malware scores justification:**  \n   - The code does not demonstrate any malicious intent or behavior.\n   - The dependency list includes common packages (`numpy`, `torch`) and dev/test tools, which are standard.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The package's URL points to a GitHub repository, which appears legitimate.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   Since no claims are provided, there's no basis to challenge any assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   With no reported issues, the scores should remain low or zero.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no identified risks)\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there are no indications of security issues, malware, or obfuscation. All scores should be minimal or zero. No further action is necessary unless new information emerges.\n\n**Note:** Always keep an eye on future updates or reports for any hidden issues.",
