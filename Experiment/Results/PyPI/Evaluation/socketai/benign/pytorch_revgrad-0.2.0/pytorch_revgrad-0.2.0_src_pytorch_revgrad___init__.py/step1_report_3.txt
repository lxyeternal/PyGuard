{
  "purpose": "Provides a PyTorch module and version information for reversing gradients, likely for adversarial training or gradient manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports RevGrad from a local module and __version__ from a version file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The code simply imports modules and version info.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for a local module and a version string. No input handling, no data processing, no external network or file operations. It appears to be a standard module initialization snippet, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an interface to a gradient-reversal module and version info. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
