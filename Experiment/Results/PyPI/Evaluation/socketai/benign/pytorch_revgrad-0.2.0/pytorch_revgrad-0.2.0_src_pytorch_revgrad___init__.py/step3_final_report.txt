  "purpose": "Import statements for the RevGrad module and version string, serving as part of a PyTorch gradient reversal utility.",
  "sources": "Importing RevGrad from local module '.module' and __version__ from '.version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet contains only import statements for internal modules, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. There are no indications of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The overall assessment confirms the code is a standard, safe component of a PyTorch-based adversarial training utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security concerns, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
