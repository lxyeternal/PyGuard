{
  "purpose": "Provides a PyTorch module and a version string for reversing gradients, likely for adversarial training or gradient manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .module and .version",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data handling or untrusted input processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; simply imports and version export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present. The module appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'RevGrad' module and a version string. No execution of untrusted data, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution. The purpose seems to be to provide gradient reversal functionality, which is common in adversarial machine learning. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected based solely on these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears legitimate, intended for gradient reversal in PyTorch models. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
