  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard, static Sphinx configuration file.\n- No external input handling, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data flow from untrusted sources is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving documentation setup purposes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not read external input or perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues found in the code or the reasoning.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- Given the uniformity and the thorough analysis, I agree with the assigned scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear, straightforward configuration)\n- Risk score: 0 (no vulnerabilities or security concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and reasoning are appropriate.",
