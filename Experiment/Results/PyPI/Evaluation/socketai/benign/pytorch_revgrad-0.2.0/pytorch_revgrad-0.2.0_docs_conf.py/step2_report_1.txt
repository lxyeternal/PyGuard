  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a static configuration file for Sphinx with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n- **Code presence:** No external input, no execution, no suspicious code.\n- **Risk and malware scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and benign is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similarly, this report confirms the code is standard configuration with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Code presence:** No dynamic code, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is straightforward configuration with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Code presence:** No input/output operations, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, the code is static configuration without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and security risk are 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall analysis:\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static, benign Sphinx configuration file.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Security risk scores:** All are 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard configuration file with no security issues. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious or obfuscating elements.",
