  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generator, defining project info, extensions, output options, and formatting.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; primarily static configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no execution or data flow paths leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely configuration code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code contains standard configuration settings with commented-out sections. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It contains no external input handling, no data processing, and no network activity. All variables and settings are static and serve documentation purposes. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code behavior are observed. The structure is typical for Sphinx conf.py files, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or security-related risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and intended for documentation build setup.",
