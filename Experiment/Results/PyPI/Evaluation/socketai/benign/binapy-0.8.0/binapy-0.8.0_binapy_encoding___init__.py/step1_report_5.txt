{
  "purpose": "Provides encoding and decoding utilities for various encodings such as Base64, Hexadecimal, and URL encoding.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: base64, dumb, hex, url",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; imports modules which may contain encoding/decoding functions",
  "flows": "Imports modules that may process untrusted data when their functions are called elsewhere in the project",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected; the module is straightforward and solely imports other modules",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with a docstring describing encoding/decoding utilities and imports four modules related to encoding functions. No runtime logic, no data processing, or untrusted input handling present in this snippet. The imported modules may contain encoding logic, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or suspicious behavior within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module primarily serving as an aggregator for encoding/decoding functions. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks are evident based solely on this fragment.",
