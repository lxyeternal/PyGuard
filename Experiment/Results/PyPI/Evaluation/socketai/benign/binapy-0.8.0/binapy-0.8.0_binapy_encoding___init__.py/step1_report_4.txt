  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding and decoding data using various schemes like Base64, Hexadecimal, and URL encoding.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: base64, dumb, hex, url",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; only import statements present",
  "flows": "No data flow; no execution of untrusted data or functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; simple import statement with inline comment",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module docstring describing its purpose, followed by a single line importing local modules. There are no functions, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or external data handling. Importing modules does not pose an immediate security risk by itself. The comment '# noqa: F401' indicates suppression of linter warnings about unused imports, which is common in utility modules to expose functions indirectly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility module for encoding/decoding tasks with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely imports other modules without any suspicious behavior.",
