  "purpose": "Utility module for encoding/decoding utilities, including Base64, Hexadecimal, URL-encoding, etc.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules: base64, dumb, hex, url",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unusual module named 'dumb', but no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring and a single import statement importing four modules. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime logic. The import of 'dumb' is unusual but not inherently malicious. No data flows, sinks, or executable code are present. The code is static and benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with only import statements and descriptive comments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The presence of 'dumb' does not imply malicious activity without further context. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.",
