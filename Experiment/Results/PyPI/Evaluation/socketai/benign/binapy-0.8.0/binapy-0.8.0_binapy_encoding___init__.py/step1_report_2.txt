  "purpose": "Utilities for encoding and decoding data in various formats such as Base64, Hex, and URL encoding.",
  "sources": "Imports of encoding modules: base64, dumb, hex, url",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imported modules may be used elsewhere in the project to process untrusted data, but no specific source-to-sink flow is present in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The module only imports other modules and contains no executable code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module declaration with a docstring describing its purpose, and it imports several utility modules for encoding. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic operations that could pose security risks. The import statement includes a 'dumb' module, which could be a placeholder or a less standard module, but its presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be part of a larger package, serving as a utility module for encoding operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module that only imports other modules for encoding tasks. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent in this snippet.",
