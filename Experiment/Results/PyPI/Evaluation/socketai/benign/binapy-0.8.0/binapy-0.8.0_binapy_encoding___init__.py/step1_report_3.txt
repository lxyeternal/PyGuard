  "purpose": "Utilities for encoding and decoding data using various schemes such as Base64, hexadecimal, and URL encoding.",
  "sources": "Imports of modules: base64, dumb, hex, url",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data processing or handling of untrusted input shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing shown; only module imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports encoding/decoding utility modules, likely to be used elsewhere for processing data. It does not contain any data handling, user input, or network operations. The import statement appears to include standard or custom modules related to data encoding. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Due to the limited scope, it's not possible to detect malicious intent solely from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility module containing import statements for encoding/decoding functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. It appears benign and standard for a utility library.",
