  "purpose": "Define a helper class for binary data manipulation with extension registration for encoding, decoding, checking, parsing, and serializing data formats.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class method definitions, decorator functions, and extension registration methods.",
  "sinks": "Extension methods invoked via extension registry, potentially executing user-defined functions.",
  "flows": "Input data read via class methods or decorators → extension methods from registry → execution of user-defined extension functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration observed; extension registration allows dynamic execution of external functions but is a controlled plugin system; no obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured, extensible system for binary data handling, including registration of custom encoders, decoders, checkers, serializers, and parsers. It relies on user-provided functions registered via decorators, which are stored in a class-level extension registry. There are no direct network operations, file I/O, or system commands. The extension mechanisms could theoretically execute malicious functions if user registers malicious extensions, but this is inherent to plugin systems and not malicious in itself. The code avoids unsafe patterns like eval, exec, or hardcoded secrets. No obfuscated code is present; the code is clean and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-designed plugin system for binary data manipulation, with no direct malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. Its extensibility could pose risk if malicious extensions are registered externally, but as-is, it does not contain malware or significant security risks.",
