{
  "purpose": "Provide helper functions for encoding and decoding data using Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 standards, with validation checks.",
  "sources": "Input data received as bytes in encode and decode functions.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data returned as bytes; potential misuse if input data is maliciously crafted for decoding functions.",
  "flows": "Input data -> validation checks (is_b64, is_b64u) -> decoding functions -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Validation functions correctly check input format. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily provides encoding/decoding utilities with validation functions. The functions use standard library methods (`base64`, `base64.urlsafe_b64decode`, `base64.b32decode`) which are safe. Validation functions check data integrity and format, not perform any malicious actions. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to expected patterns for such utilities. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Base64 and Base32 encoding utilities with proper validation. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is detected. It is safe for use from a security standpoint.",
