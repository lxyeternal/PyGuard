{
  "purpose": "This module provides encoding and decoding helpers for Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 encodings, primarily for data transformation and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments (bytes type). Uses external library 'binapy' for decorators and some functions.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from encoding functions, data validated in is_b64 and is_b64u functions. No evident data leakage or external data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to encode/decode functions, which perform transformations or validation checks, then return processed data or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with proper validation functions and no suspicious code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior is present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python 'base64' library for encoding/decoding with additional validation checks for Base64 and Base64-url formats. Validation functions check data size and character sets, adhering to standard Base64 rules. The functions include strict mode options that raise exceptions on invalid input. No use of environment variables, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code relies on external 'binapy' decorators, which do not pose evident security risks but should be verified separately for maliciousness. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility module for encoding operations with proper validation, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 encoding/decoding with validation checks. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided content. It is safe for use in applications requiring data encoding.",
