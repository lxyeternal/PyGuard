  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for encoding and decoding data using Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 with validation checks.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through function parameters (bytes type).",
  "sinks": "Decoded data can be returned; no untrusted output handling or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments into encoding/decoding functions, with validation checks (is_b64, is_b64u) performed before decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscation detected. Validation functions correctly check for proper base64 formatting. No suspicious external calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple encoding/decoding functions with validation checks to ensure data integrity for base64, base64-url, and base32 encodings. It uses a custom 'binapy' framework for marking encoders, decoders, and checkers. Validation functions verify proper formatting, including character sets and padding, reducing risk of malformed data. The functions appear to perform standard encoding operations without side effects. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. Usage of external libraries ('binapy', 'string', 'base64') is benign in this context. The code is straightforward and consistent with normal encoding utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 encoding/decoding with validation checks. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be safe and well-structured.",
