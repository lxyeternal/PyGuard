  "purpose": "Provides encoding and decoding helpers for Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 encodings with validation functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from function arguments (bp: bytes); validation functions check input data validity.",
  "sinks": "Base64 and Base64-url decoding functions, which process potentially untrusted encoded data for decoding.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated (via is_b64 or is_b64u), then decoded with base64 functions. No untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Validation functions correctly check data format; no obfuscation, no suspicious dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines clear, standard encoding/decoding functions using Python's base64 module, with proper validation functions for Base64 and Base64-url data. The is_b64 and is_b64u functions correctly validate input data by checking length, character set, and padding. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions are safe, standard, and straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code appears designed for legitimate encoding tasks within larger systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 encoding/decoding with appropriate validation. No malicious behavior or malicious code is detected. The implementation is typical for encoding helpers, with no suspicious features.",
