{
  "purpose": "Provides encoding and decoding helpers for Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 with validation functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for encoding/decoding functions and validation checks (e.g., input bytes in encode_b64, decode_b64, is_b64, etc.)",
  "sinks": "Returns encoded/decoded data; validation functions check data format before decoding to prevent errors.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated via is_b64 or is_b64u; if valid, passed to base64 decoding functions; otherwise, errors are raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected. Validation functions correctly implement standard checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of encoding/decoding with validation, relying on standard Python libraries. Validation functions correctly check data length, character set, and padding. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation present. External decorators appear benign. No signs of malicious behavior or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 encoding/decoding with proper validation. No malicious or suspicious features are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with the code's nature.",
