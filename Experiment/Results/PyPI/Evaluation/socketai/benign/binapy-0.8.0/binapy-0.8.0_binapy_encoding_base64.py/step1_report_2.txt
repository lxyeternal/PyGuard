  "purpose": "Helpers for Base64, Base64-url, and Base32 encoding and decoding, with validation functions.",
  "sources": "Functions read input data from the 'bp' byte string parameter for encoding/decoding and validation.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data is returned; no external sinks or data leaks are directly evident. No network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input data ('bp') is processed through validation functions (is_b64, is_b64u) before decoding; encoding functions process input data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures. Validation functions check format but do not perform harmful operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard base64 and base32 encoding/decoding with optional strict validation. Validation functions verify format correctness via set checks and padding rules. The decode functions conditionally raise errors if validation fails, preventing malformed data processing. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling was found. The use of third-party 'binapy' appears to be for encoding registration, not malicious intent. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of encoding helpers with validation, without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration, and there are no indications of malware. It is safe for use.",
