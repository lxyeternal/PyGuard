  "purpose": "Import of a local or standard zlib module, likely for compression utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package or standard library",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; import is static and unused",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal code, no obfuscation, no data handling",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a docstring and a relative import of 'zlib'. There are no functions, data flows, or external interactions. The import appears legitimate, referencing either a local module or standard library. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The import is unused, but this does not imply malicious intent. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of an import statement for compression utilities. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
