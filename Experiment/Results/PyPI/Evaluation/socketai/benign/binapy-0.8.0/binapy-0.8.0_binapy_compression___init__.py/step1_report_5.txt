  "purpose": "Utilities related to compression, likely providing functions for data compression and decompression.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing the 'zlib' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic; only a module import is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'zlib' module, which is a standard compression library. No input or output operations are present, and there are no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The import is from the current package, which appears legitimate. There is no code execution, data handling, or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for compression functions.",
