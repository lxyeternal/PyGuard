  "purpose": "Contains compression related utilities, specifically importing the zlib module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing zlib module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports the standard library module zlib for compression purposes. There are no functions, data handling, or other operations that could lead to malicious activity. The import is from a relative module, which suggests it is part of a larger package; however, this fragment alone does not contain any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing a standard import of a compression library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
