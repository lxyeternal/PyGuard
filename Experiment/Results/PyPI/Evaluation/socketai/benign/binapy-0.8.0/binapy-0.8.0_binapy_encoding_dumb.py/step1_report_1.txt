{
  "purpose": "Implement support for 'dumb' ciphers such as Caesar cipher, providing encoding and decoding functions.",
  "sources": "Input data `bp`, optional `shift`, `alphabet` parameter",
  "sinks": "Byte transformation in `encode_caesar` and `decode_caesar` functions",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the encoding/decoding functions, which transform bytes using a simple Caesar cipher logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No unusual behavior or obfuscation detected. Usage of external library `binapy` appears benign and relevant to encoding/decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward implementation of Caesar cipher encoding and decoding with auto-detection of alphabet. It uses standard Python libraries (`string`) and a third-party library `binapy` for encoder/decoder registration. The logic is simple byte-wise shifting, with no external data leakage, no system commands, no network activity, and no code injection. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a benign utility for simple cipher transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic implementation of Caesar cipher encoding/decoding with no malicious intent. No security risks are identified. The code is well-structured and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
