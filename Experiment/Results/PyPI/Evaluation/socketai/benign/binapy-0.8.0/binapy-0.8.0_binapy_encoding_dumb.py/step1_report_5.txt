{
  "purpose": "Implement support for 'dumb' ciphers such as Caesar cipher, providing encoding and decoding functions.",
  "sources": "Input data `bp` (bytes), optional `shift` value, optional `alphabet` parameter.",
  "sinks": "Bytes returned after transformation; no external sinks or data leakage points directly evident.",
  "flows": "Input data `bp` flows into encoding functions which apply Caesar shift; encoded data is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious external connections. Usage of `binapy_decoder` and `binapy_encoder` decorators could be examined, but assuming they are for standard encoding/decoding registration, they are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward Caesar cipher encoding and decoding functions, with auto-detection of alphabet types. It does not perform network communication, system modifications, or access external resources. No embedded malicious behavior or backdoors identified. The use of decorators for registration is standard; assuming `binapy` library functions are safe. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of simple Caesar cipher encoding and decoding functions with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
