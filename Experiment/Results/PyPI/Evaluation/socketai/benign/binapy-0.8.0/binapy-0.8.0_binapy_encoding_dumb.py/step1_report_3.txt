  "purpose": "Implement support for 'dumb' ciphers such as Caesar cipher for encoding and decoding data.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: bp (bytes input), shift (integer), alphabet (optional string or bytes).",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs in-memory data transformation without external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data (bp) flows into encode_caesar/decode_caesar, which process and return transformed bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation. The code is straightforward cipher implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple Caesar cipher encoding/decoding functions, auto-detecting alphabet based on input data characteristics. The functions only perform in-memory transformations without external data transmission, file access, or network connections. No malicious behavior or malware signatures are evident. The code appears to be a benign utility for educational or encryption purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements basic Caesar cipher encoding/decoding without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is negligible, and no malicious intent is detected.",
