{
  "purpose": "Implement support for 'dumb' ciphers such as Caesar cipher.",
  "sources": "Input data bytes `bp`, alphabet parameter, internal auto-detection logic",
  "sinks": "Bytes returned after shifting characters; no external sinks or data leaks",
  "flows": "Input bytes -> alphabet detection/selection -> character shifting -> output bytes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple Caesar cipher encoding and decoding functions with auto-detection of alphabet type. It uses standard libraries and benign decorators for registration. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is transparent, handling various alphabet types and shifting bytes accordingly. No external system calls or data exfiltration are involved. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is appropriate at 0. The obfuscation score is 0, reflecting code clarity. The overall security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of Caesar cipher encoding/decoding with no malicious intent or security issues. The provided reports accurately assess the code as non-malicious, non-obfuscated, and with negligible security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
