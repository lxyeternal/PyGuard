{
  "purpose": "Provide encoding and decoding support for 'dumb' ciphers like Caesar cipher using auto-detection of alphabet.",
  "sources": "Input data `bp`, function arguments `shift`, `alphabet`",
  "sinks": "Bytes returned after transformation, no direct external data sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Input data `bp` flows through the encoding/decoding functions, which manipulate it based on the specified alphabet and shift",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or external network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple Caesar cipher logic with alphabet auto-detection, handling various character sets. It uses external libraries for encoding/decoding but does not invoke any network, file, or system commands. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The logic appears straightforward and typical for such an encoding scheme, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic Caesar cipher encoding and decoding, with proper handling of different alphabets. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
