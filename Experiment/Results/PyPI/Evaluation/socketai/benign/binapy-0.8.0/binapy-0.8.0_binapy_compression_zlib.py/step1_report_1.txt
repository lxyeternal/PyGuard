  "purpose": "Provide helper functions for compressing and decompressing data using zlib and deflate algorithms, integrated with binapy encoding/decoding framework.",
  "sources": "Input data for compression or decompression (bp: bytes), optional buffer size parameter (bufsize).",
  "sinks": "Output compressed or decompressed data; no untrusted data flow leading to system effects or leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data -> compress/decompress functions -> output data; no flow to external systems or network observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. Use of slicing [2:-4] in compress_deflate could be a concern but appears to be standard for deflate without zlib headers.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward compression/decompression functions using zlib, with proper parameters and no apparent obfuscation or malicious constructs. It leverages external libraries (binapy) but does not execute untrusted code or data. No unsafe operations, code injections, or privacy violations are present. The slicing operation in compress_deflate is standard for deflate streams, not malicious. No network, file system, or data exfiltration activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The module provides standard, safe compression helpers with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, with no anomalies or malware indications.",
