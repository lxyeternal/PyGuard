{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for compressing and decompressing data using zlib with additional encoding/decoding via binapy.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments `bp` (bytes) in compress/decompress functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs compressed/decompressed data; no direct sinks for untrusted data within the functions themselves.",
  "flows": "Input data (`bp`) flows into zlib compression/decompression functions, producing output data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward wrapper functions around zlib compression/decompression. It uses standard library functions, with no dynamic code execution or hidden data handling. The inclusion of binapy decorators indicates data encoding/decoding management but does not introduce malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no backdoors, and no signs of malicious data leakage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data compression helpers with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be well-structured and safe for intended use.",
