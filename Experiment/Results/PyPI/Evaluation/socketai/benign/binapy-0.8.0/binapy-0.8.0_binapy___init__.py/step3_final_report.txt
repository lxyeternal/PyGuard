{
  "purpose": "Package initializer for BinaPy, exposing core classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.binapy, compression, encoding, hashing, parsing).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports and symbol exports only.",
  "flows": "Import statements and symbol exports without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file that imports classes and functions from internal modules and defines the public API via __all__. It also imports submodules for internal organization. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or input handling. The structure is typical for a Python package initializer, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
