{
  "purpose": "This is a top-level package initializer for BinaPy, designed to expose key modules and classes for users.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .binapy, .compression, .encoding, .hashing, .parsing",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted input or perform any data output or network operations",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only imports and exposes components",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package setup code with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports core classes and functions from local modules, assigns exports to __all__, and imports submodules for modular access. There are no runtime data flows, no user inputs, network interactions, or dynamic code execution. All elements serve standard package initialization purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply organizes and exposes modules for the BinaPy package.",
