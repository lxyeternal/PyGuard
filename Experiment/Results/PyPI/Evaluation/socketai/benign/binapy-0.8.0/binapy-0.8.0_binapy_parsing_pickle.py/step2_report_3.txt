  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the underlying logic.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code wraps `pickle.dumps()` and `pickle.loads()`.\n- The core risk stems from the inherent insecurity of `pickle` when handling untrusted data, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present in the code itself.\n- The use of `binapy` decorators does not introduce additional security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n**Presence of issues:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious logic or vulnerabilities beyond the inherent risks of `pickle`.\n- The reports correctly note that deserialization with `pickle.loads()` on untrusted data is dangerous.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reasoning:**\n- No significant logical flaws are evident.\n- The reports appropriately highlight the security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports assign `0`. This is correct; no malware or malicious behavior is present in the code itself.\n- The risk is purely due to the use of `pickle` with untrusted data, not malicious code embedded in the codebase.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n**Security risk score:**\n- Reports range from 0.4 to 0.9, generally reflecting the inherent danger of `pickle`.\n- Given the code's simplicity and standard use, a score of **0.4** to **0.5** seems appropriate, unless the context indicates the functions are exposed to untrusted data.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- If these functions are used in untrusted contexts, the risk is high (close to 0.9).\n- If used in trusted environments, the risk is lower (~0.4-0.5).\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and reasoning:\n\n- The reports are consistent in their understanding that the core issue is the unsafe deserialization.\n- They correctly do not attribute malware or obfuscation to the code itself.\n- The security risk scores are somewhat conservative but justified given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.4 to 0.5 (assuming typical safe usage in trusted environments)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports could emphasize that the primary mitigation is to **avoid deserializing untrusted data** rather than modifying the code.\n- If the functions are intended for internal use only, the risk is minimal; if exposed externally, the risk is high.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward.\n- **Malware:** No malware detected; scores are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk:** Should be set around 0.4-0.5 unless specified that the functions are exposed to untrusted data, in which case 0.9 could be justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The security risk score should be context-dependent but generally around 0.4-0.5 for trusted environments, higher if used with untrusted data.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to suggest specific mitigations or contextual risk adjustments!",
