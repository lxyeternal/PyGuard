  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and standard, but its use with untrusted data poses significant security risks. The high risk scores are justified, and no malicious behavior is detected. The malware score remains at 0, and the obfuscation score at 0. The overall security concern is the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data, not malicious code embedded in the module."
