  "purpose": "Helper functions for converting data to and from JSON format, including custom encoding for specific data types.",
  "sources": "Input data to 'from_json' function for serialization; output of 'to_json' function for deserialization.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() and json.dumps() functions handle data parsing and serialization.",
  "flows": "Data is parsed from bytes in 'to_json' and serialized to bytes in 'from_json' using standard JSON functions, with custom encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of third-party 'binapy' appears standard; no dynamic code execution or external data sources involved.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard JSON serialization/deserialization with a custom default encoder that handles datetime, Mapping, and Iterable objects. It uses the 'json' module safely, with appropriate configuration for compact or pretty-printed output. No user input is directly executed or evaluated as code; data is only processed via standard JSON parsing/serialization. The 'binapy' decorators are for registration and do not pose security issues. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, implementing standard JSON handling with safe practices and no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
