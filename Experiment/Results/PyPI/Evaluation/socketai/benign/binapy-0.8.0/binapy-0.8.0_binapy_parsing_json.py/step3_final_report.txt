  "sources": "json.loads(bp) for parsing JSON; json.dumps(data, default=default_encoder, **kwargs) for serialization.",
  "sinks": "json.loads(bp) potentially processing untrusted input; json.dumps output is safe.",
  "flows": "Input data -> json.loads -> parsed object; data -> json.dumps -> JSON bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard JSON serialization/deserialization with custom default encoding for datetime, Mapping, and Iterable types. It uses Python's built-in json library and relies on decorators for registration. No code injection, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The untrusted input handling via json.loads() is typical but warrants caution at application level; the code itself does not perform validation or sanitization. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the straightforward, safe implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe JSON helper module with custom type handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
