  "purpose": "Helpers for converting data to/from JSON format, including custom serialization for certain data types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data for JSON serialization in the `from_json` function and JSON strings in the `to_json` function.",
  "sinks": "The `json.loads(bp)` in `to_json` parses external JSON data; `json.dumps()` in `from_json` serializes data potentially including untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input bytes from external sources are parsed via `to_json`; data to be serialized flows into `from_json` and is processed with a custom encoder, then output as JSON bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of external library `binapy` appears standard for parsing/serializing with custom tags. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard JSON serialization/deserialization with custom handling for datetime, mappings, and iterables. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior observed. The `json.loads()` and `json.dumps()` are used in conventional ways. Custom `_default_json_encode` handles common data types securely. No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads are present. Use of `binapy` decorators is for serialization hooks and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The module provides standard, secure JSON serialization/deserialization helpers with custom type handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code is safe and suitable for use in applications requiring JSON data processing.",
