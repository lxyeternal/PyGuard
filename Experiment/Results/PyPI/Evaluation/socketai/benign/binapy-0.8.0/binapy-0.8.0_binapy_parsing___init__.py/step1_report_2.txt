  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import of standard modules",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports standard Python modules 'json' and 'pickle' using relative import syntax. These modules are commonly used for data serialization and deserialization. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are present. The code does not perform any actions, contain any embedded data, or execute any untrusted code. The import statements are standard and do not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements for standard serialization modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
