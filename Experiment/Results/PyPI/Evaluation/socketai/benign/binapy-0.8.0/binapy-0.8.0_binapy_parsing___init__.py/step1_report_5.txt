  "purpose": "Helpers for parsing or serializing data in various formats",

  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle import can be risky if untrusted data is deserialized; no actual usage shown",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'json' and 'pickle' modules, which are standard Python libraries for data serialization. No functions, data handling, or execution logic is provided. The presence of 'pickle' is noteworthy because it can execute arbitrary code during unpickling if used improperly, but since no actual deserialization occurs here, the risk is minimal in this fragment. No malicious behavior or anomalies are evident. The code is minimal and appears to serve as a helper module.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple helper module with no immediate malicious behavior. The import of 'pickle' warrants caution if later used for deserialization of untrusted data, but the current fragment does not demonstrate misuse. Overall, low risk with awareness needed for future deserialization practices.",
