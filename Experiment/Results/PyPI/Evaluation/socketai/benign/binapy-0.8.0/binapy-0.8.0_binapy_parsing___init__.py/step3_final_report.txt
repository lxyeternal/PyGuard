  "anomalies": "No active code, only import statements; no deserialization or execution present",
  "analysis": "The code only imports standard modules json and pickle without any data processing or deserialization. The presence of pickle poses a potential security concern if used improperly later, but in this snippet, no such usage occurs. The import statements themselves are benign, and no obfuscation or malicious code is present. The risk score reflects the potential danger of pickle if misused, but the current code is safe. The malware score is zero, and obfuscation is absent. Confidence is high due to the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with only import statements; no malicious or suspicious activity is present. The only consideration is the potential risk if pickle is used for deserialization elsewhere, which warrants a low security risk score. Overall, the code poses minimal immediate threat.",
