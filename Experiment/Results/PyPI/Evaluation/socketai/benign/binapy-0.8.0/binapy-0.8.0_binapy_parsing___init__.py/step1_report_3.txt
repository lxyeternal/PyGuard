  "purpose": "Helpers for parsing or serializing data in various formats",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'json' and 'pickle' modules",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible due to lack of data processing code",
  "anomalies": "Simple import statements; no unusual or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements for standard Python modules 'json' and 'pickle'. There is no data handling, input/output, or logic that could lead to security issues. The use of 'pickle' warrants caution in other contexts due to potential deserialization vulnerabilities, but here it is only imported and not used. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not perform any data processing or contain hidden behaviors.",
