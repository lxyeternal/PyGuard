  "sinks": "Potential usage of pickle module for deserialization of untrusted data",
  "flows": "Import of pickle suggests possible deserialization operations which could lead to code execution if used improperly",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements; no actual data handling or processing present",
  "analysis": "The code imports json and pickle modules, which are standard Python libraries for data serialization. The pickle module is known for security risks if used to deserialize untrusted data, but in this snippet, no such usage occurs. The code appears to be a simple helper module with no execution logic or data processing. No malicious behavior is evident in the current code. The import statement may suggest potential future use of pickle, which requires careful handling in actual usage to avoid security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no active processing or malicious behavior. The presence of pickle is noted but not exploited here; potential risks depend on how pickle is used elsewhere.",
