  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, anomalies, and suspicious features.",
  "sources": "Untrusted input functions, environment variables, network sockets, dynamic code execution points (eval()/exec()), hardcoded IPs/URLs, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, command execution, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "From sources such as input functions or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or system commands, potentially via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded IPs/URLs, obfuscated variable names, minimal comments, dynamic code patterns, suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious features such as dynamic code execution and hardcoded data, indicating moderate malicious potential. No explicit malicious payloads or signatures are observed, but the anomalies justify suspicion. The scores assigned (malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.4, security risk 0.6) are consistent with the analysis. Benign code lacks such features, reflected in low scores. The absence of code in some reports is correctly scored as zero. Overall, the scores align with the evidence, with Report 1 justifying moderate suspicion and others indicating benign or non-suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion due to dynamic execution and hardcoded data, warranting cautious review. The scores are appropriate and justified, with no major adjustments needed. The primary concern remains the suspicious features in Report 1, which merit further static/dynamic analysis.",
