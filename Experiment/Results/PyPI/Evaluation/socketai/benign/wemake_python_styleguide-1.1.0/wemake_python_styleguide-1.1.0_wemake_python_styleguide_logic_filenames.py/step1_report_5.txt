{
  "purpose": "The function get_stem extracts the filename without extension from a given file path.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'file_path', which is expected to be a string representing a file path.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write or transmit untrusted data to any external system; it solely processes and returns a value derived from the input.",
  "flows": "Input 'file_path' is passed into PurePath, which processes it and the 'stem' property is returned; no external data flow or network interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any unusual or suspicious constructs. It does not handle or process any sensitive information, credentials, or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'PurePath' from 'pathlib' and defines a function 'get_stem' to extract the filename without extension. It includes docstrings with examples, which are standard for documentation and testing. The logic is simple, using 'PurePath(file_path).stem' to obtain the filename stem. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious constructs. The code performs a benign, well-understood operation related to filesystem path manipulation. No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe, standard operation for extracting filename stems from file paths. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward utility function with no evident vulnerabilities.",
