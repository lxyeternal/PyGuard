{
  "purpose": "The function extracts the filename stem (name without extension) from a given file path.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'file_path', which is a string representing a file path.",
  "sinks": "The return statement provides the filename stem; no other sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The function takes 'file_path' as source and returns the stem derived from it, with no data flowing to any external or sensitive sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and relies solely on the standard library without any obfuscated constructs or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'PurePath' from the 'pathlib' module and defines a function that returns the stem of the provided file path. It includes docstrings with examples for testing. There are no external data sources, no manipulation of untrusted data beyond standard path parsing, and no suspicious or malicious logic. The implementation is simple and standard for path handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation of extracting filename stems from paths. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and secure within its scope.",
