{
  "purpose": "The function get_stem extracts the filename without its extension from a given file path.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'file_path' received from external callers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause harm, such as executing code or leaking data.",
  "flows": "Input 'file_path' flows into the PurePath constructor, then the 'stem' attribute is accessed, which is a safe and read-only property.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library 'pathlib' and defines a function that simply returns the filename without extension from a given path. It includes docstrings with examples, but no user input is processed beyond function parameters. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior appears to be present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs a standard path manipulation task without any malicious intent or security risks.",
