{
  "purpose": "The function extracts the filename without its extension from a given file path.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'file_path' provided to the get_stem function.",
  "sinks": "The function solely processes the input path to return a modified string; there are no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'file_path' flows into PurePath, which processes it to extract the stem; no further data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function using the pathlib.PurePath class to parse and extract the filename stem from a provided path string. The function includes docstring examples demonstrating expected behavior for different path inputs. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are involved. The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard utility function with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filename manipulation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It is straightforward, well-structured, and does not perform any risky operations.",
