  "purpose": "Extracts the filename stem from a given file path using pathlib.PurePath.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'file_path' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; function only processes input string and returns a string.",
  "flows": "Input 'file_path' -> PurePath(file_path).stem -> return value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard library without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes a string path, uses pathlib.PurePath to parse it, and returns the stem (filename without extension). The implementation is simple, safe, and relies solely on standard library functions. No external data flows, network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The docstring examples demonstrate typical usage with POSIX and Windows paths. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious intent are detected. The function's purpose is benign, and the code is well-structured and documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
