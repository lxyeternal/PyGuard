{
  "purpose": "The function extracts the filename without its extension from a given file path.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'file_path' received as a string, which is a file path.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is sent to external systems, network, or storage.",
  "flows": "Input 'file_path' is processed by 'PurePath(file_path).stem' to produce output; no external or untrusted flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'PurePath' from 'pathlib' and defines a function to return the stem of a path. The function documentation provides usage examples. The implementation relies on standard library behavior, with no dynamic execution or obfuscated code. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code behaviors such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for filename manipulation with no malicious behavior detected. It poses no security risks and appears to be safe for use.",
