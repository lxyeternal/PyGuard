  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\nThe code is a simple utility function:\n\n```python\nimport ast\n\ndef get_assigned_expr(node: ast.AST) -> ast.AST:\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to retrieve assigned value from ``NamedExpr``.\n\n    If the node is an actual ``NamedExpr``, the assigned value will be returned.\n    For other node type, the original node is returned.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(node, ast.NamedExpr):\n        return node.value\n    return node\n```\n\n- The function checks if the input node is an instance of `ast.NamedExpr` (the walrus operator introduced in Python 3.8).\n- If so, it returns the `value` attribute, which is the right-hand side of the assignment expression.\n- Otherwise, it returns the node itself.\n\n**Security and Malicious Intent:**\n\n- The code performs a straightforward type check and attribute access.\n- It does not execute code, process untrusted input beyond type checking, or perform any I/O.\n- There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- It is a benign utility function used in static code analysis or AST processing.\n\n**Analysis of Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, safe, and standard.\n- They consistently note no anomalies, no malicious behavior, and no security risks.\n- The confidence scores are all 1.0, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n\n- The only possible concern is if this function is misused in a larger context, but as a standalone utility, it is safe.\n- The function handles only static AST nodes; it does not process external or untrusted data directly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign, straightforward utility for AST manipulation.\n- No modifications or increased risk scores are warranted.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
