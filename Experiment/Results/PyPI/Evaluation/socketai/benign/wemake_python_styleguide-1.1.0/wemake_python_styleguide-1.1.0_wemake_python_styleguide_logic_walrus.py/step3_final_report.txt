  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve the value from an ast.NamedExpr node if present, otherwise returns the node itself.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'node' which is an AST node, potentially from AST parsing or analysis processes.",
  "sinks": "None; the function performs a read-only check and attribute access, with no data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Type check of 'node' -> conditional return of 'node.value' if 'node' is ast.NamedExpr -> return node otherwise.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a simple type check on an AST node to determine if it is a NamedExpr (walrus operator). If so, it returns the 'value' attribute; otherwise, it returns the node itself. It operates solely on AST nodes with no external data or side effects. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present. The code is a standard utility for static analysis or AST manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function for AST processing. It performs a simple type check and attribute access without any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
