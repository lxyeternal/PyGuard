{
  "purpose": "The code provides a helper function to retrieve the assigned value from a Python AST node, specifically handling the 'NamedExpr' (walrus operator).",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'node', which is an AST node.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: input 'node' is checked for its type, and if it's a 'NamedExpr', its 'value' attribute is returned; otherwise, the original node is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated constructs, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is simple and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function to handle AST nodes, particularly extracting the 'value' from a 'NamedExpr' node. It uses 'isinstance' to check the node type and conditionally returns the appropriate node. The implementation appears standard and does not involve dynamic code execution, external input handling, or any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for AST manipulation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is benign and straightforward.",
