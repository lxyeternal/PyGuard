  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve assigned value from a NamedExpr node in an AST.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'node', which is an AST node.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the function does not perform any data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input node is checked for type; if it's a NamedExpr, its value is returned; otherwise, the original node is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscated code. No malicious behavior or anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the provided AST node is a NamedExpr. If so, it returns the value part of the NamedExpr; if not, it returns the original node. The implementation is simple, with no external data access, side effects, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function intended for AST analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
