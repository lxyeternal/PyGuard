{
  "purpose": "Helper function to retrieve the assigned value from an ast.NamedExpr node, or return the node itself if not a NamedExpr.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'node' of type ast.AST, potentially from external or untrusted source, but not explicitly shown in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the function does not process or output untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input node is checked for type; if NamedExpr, its 'value' attribute is returned; otherwise, the original node is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code performs a straightforward type check and attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function for AST manipulation, specifically to extract the value from a NamedExpr node. It checks if the input node is an instance of ast.NamedExpr, and if so, returns its 'value' attribute; otherwise, it returns the node itself. This is standard AST processing with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The function's purpose is benign and typical for static analysis or AST transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for AST node handling with no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs a standard type check and attribute access with no suspicious behavior.",
