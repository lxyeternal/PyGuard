  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve assigned value from an ast.NamedExpr node in Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'node', which is an AST node, and checks its type.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write or output data; it only processes and returns parts of an AST node.",
  "flows": "Input 'node' flows into type check; if 'node' is ast.NamedExpr, its 'value' is returned; otherwise, the original node is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper function that inspects an AST node. It checks if the node is of type ast.NamedExpr (Python 3.8+ syntax for assignment expressions). If so, it returns the assigned value; otherwise, it returns the node unchanged. The implementation is simple, safe, and intended for AST processing, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. No external inputs, outputs, or side effects are involved. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function used for AST analysis. It performs no malicious actions and does not pose security risks.",
