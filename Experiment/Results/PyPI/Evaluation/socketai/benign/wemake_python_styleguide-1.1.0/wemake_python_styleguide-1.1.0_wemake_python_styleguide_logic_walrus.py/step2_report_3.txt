  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines a helper function `get_assigned_expr` that takes an AST node.\n   - It checks if the node is an instance of `ast.NamedExpr` (Python 3.8+ walrus operator).\n   - If so, it returns `node.value`; otherwise, it returns the node itself.\n   - The implementation is straightforward, safe, and standard for AST processing.\n   - No external inputs, outputs, or side effects are involved.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly describe the function as a benign utility for AST analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the function performs a simple type check and attribute access.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious behaviors are reported or observed.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The reports do not suggest any security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified as no security issues are present.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only possible concern could be if this function is used maliciously to manipulate ASTs, but on its own, it’s a benign utility.\n   - No external data, code execution, or data leaks are involved.\n   - The function's purpose is clear and safe.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a simple, standard AST utility function.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The function does not pose any security threat.\n- The reports correctly assess the code as benign.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, safe utility for AST analysis with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scoring and reasoning are appropriate and should not be changed.",
