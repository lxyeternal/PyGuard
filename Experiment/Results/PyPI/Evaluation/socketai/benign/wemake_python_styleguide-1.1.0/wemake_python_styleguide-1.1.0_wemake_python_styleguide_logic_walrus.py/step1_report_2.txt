{
  "purpose": "The code defines a helper function to retrieve the assigned value from an AST node, specifically handling 'NamedExpr' nodes.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'node' which is an AST node.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is simple: input 'node' is checked for its type, and possibly its 'value' attribute is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the provided AST node is a 'NamedExpr' and, if so, returns its 'value' attribute; otherwise, it returns the node itself. The code is simple, with no external data sources, sinks, or suspicious constructs. It does not involve dynamic code execution or external communications. Overall, the code is a standard utility for AST processing without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign helper function for AST analysis with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
