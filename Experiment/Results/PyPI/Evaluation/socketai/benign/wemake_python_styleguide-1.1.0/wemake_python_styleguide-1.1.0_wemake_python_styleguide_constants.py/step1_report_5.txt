{
  "purpose": "Define various constants, blacklists, whitelists, and patterns used for code analysis, security checks, and validation within a larger Python project, focusing on security and coding standards enforcement.",
  "sources": "Read from imported modules (math, re, typing), constant definitions, and list/set initializations for blacklists, whitelists, and patterns.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines data structures and constants without executing untrusted data or performing I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only sets up static configurations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs. All content appears to be configuration data and static definitions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines various whitelists, blacklists, constants, and regex patterns used for static code analysis and security checks. It imports standard modules but does not execute any code based on these imports or on the data structures. No functions or dynamic logic are present that could be exploited or used maliciously. The code is well-structured, purely declarative, and aligned with typical code quality and security enforcement practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a configuration module for security and quality checks. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. It is safe and appears to be part of a static analysis or linting framework. No security risks are present.",
