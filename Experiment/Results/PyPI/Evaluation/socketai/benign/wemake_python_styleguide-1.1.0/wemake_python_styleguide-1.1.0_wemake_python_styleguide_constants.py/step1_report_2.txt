{
  "purpose": "Define constants, blacklists, whitelists, and configuration parameters for a Python security/linting tool to enforce coding standards and security rules.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import math`, `import re`, `from typing import Final`) and variable definitions (constant lists, frozensets, regex patterns).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or data manipulation based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "None; there are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code solely consists of static data structures and constants. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The module strictly contains predefined constants, blacklists, whitelists, regex patterns, and configuration parameters used for code analysis or security checks. All variables are immutable (`Final`, `frozenset`) and are intended as static configuration data. No input handling, data processing, or network interactions occur. The import statements are standard, and no code performs operations beyond defining constants. No signs of malicious intent or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious configuration module intended for use within a security or linting framework. It contains only static data definitions, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
