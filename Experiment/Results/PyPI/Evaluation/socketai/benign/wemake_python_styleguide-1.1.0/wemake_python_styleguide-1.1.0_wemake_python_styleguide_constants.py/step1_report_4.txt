{
  "purpose": "This module defines various constants, blacklists, whitelists, and configuration parameters for static code analysis and security checks within a Python security tool or linter.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables are defined directly within the module; no external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows, nor does it execute or evaluate external data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely initializes immutable constant sets and configurations.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily contains static data definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or backdoors are detected. The only noteworthy aspect is the extensive list of blacklists and whitelists used for static analysis, which is typical for such security-related configuration modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module that provides constants and sets used to enforce code quality and security rules. It includes forbidden function names, module metadata variables, variable names, and magic methods, among others. There is no dynamic or executable code, no code injection points, and no external data processing. The code is well-structured, documented, and appears to serve as part of a larger static analysis or security tool. No anomalies indicating malicious intent or malicious behavior are detected. The focus is on defining restrictions and safe lists for static code analysis, not executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a standard static configuration file for a Python security or linting tool. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-documented set of constants and restrictions used to enhance static code analysis security checks.",
