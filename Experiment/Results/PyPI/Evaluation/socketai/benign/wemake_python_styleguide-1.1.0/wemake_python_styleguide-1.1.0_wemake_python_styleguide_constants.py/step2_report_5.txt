  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining constants, blacklists, whitelists, regex patterns, and configuration parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external data sources are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- Import statements are standard (`math`, `re`, `typing.Final`) with no anomalies.\n- The code is well-structured, documented, and intended for static analysis or security enforcement tools.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n1. **Are the reported issues present?**  \n   - All reports conclude that the code is a benign static configuration module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n   - No anomalies, no code execution, no data flow from untrusted sources.  \n   - **Confirmed:** The code matches the descriptions and contains only static data.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic or reasoning?**  \n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.  \n   - The lists and constants are appropriate for their purpose, and the documentation is clear.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.  \n   - These are reasonable given the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   - No reason to assign higher scores; the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - No malicious activity or code injection is present; malware score should remain 0.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   - No such claims are made; all reports are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration module with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The high confidence levels (1 or 1.0) are justified.\n- The absence of any suspicious patterns, dynamic code, or obfuscation supports the malware and security risk scores being zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n- No malicious code, no code execution, no obfuscation.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- Clear, well-structured, static data.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0**  \n- No security vulnerabilities, no data flows, no external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign static configuration module, suitable for static analysis or security enforcement tools, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**End of analysis.**",
