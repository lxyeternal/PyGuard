{
  "purpose": "This module defines static constants, blacklists, whitelists, regex patterns, and configuration parameters used for static code analysis, security enforcement, or linting within Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined constants, lists, and regex patterns; no external input or dynamic data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input; the code only contains static definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code is purely static; it serves as a reference configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data definitions including constants, blacklists, whitelists, regex patterns, and configuration limits. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external interactions. The data structures are immutable, indicating intentional static configuration. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The import statements are standard, and the purpose is clearly for static analysis or security enforcement. The absence of dynamic code, input handling, or external data sources confirms that the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
