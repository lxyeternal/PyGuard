  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining constants, blacklists, whitelists, regex patterns, and configuration parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, input processing, or external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or backdoors.\n- All data structures are immutable (`Final`, `frozenset`), indicating intentional static configuration.\n- Import statements are standard; no suspicious or unnecessary imports.\n- The purpose is clearly for static code analysis, security enforcement, or linting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code contains only static data definitions, with no runtime or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are detected.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The purpose and analysis are consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or points of critique:\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?** No, all are correctly low (0 or 0.1). The code does not pose any security threat.\n- **Malware score?** Correctly zero, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated?** Correctly zero; the code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis and conclusion?** Consistent and justified; no false positives or overestimations.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **The code is a static configuration module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.**\n- **Scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the content.**\n- **No changes needed in scoring or reasoning.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, static, and intended for code analysis purposes. All scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a minimal security risk score (which is correctly zero).\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the purpose of the code.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent. The code is safe, static, and contains no malicious elements.",
