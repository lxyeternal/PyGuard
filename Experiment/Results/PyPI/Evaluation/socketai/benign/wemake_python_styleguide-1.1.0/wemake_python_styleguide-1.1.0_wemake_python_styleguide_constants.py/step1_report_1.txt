{
  "purpose": "Define constants, blacklists, whitelists, and patterns used for code analysis and validation within a security or code quality tool.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of constants, string patterns, and lists; no runtime input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as this module only contains static data definitions and no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this module does not process or manipulate data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious activity. The code primarily consists of static lists and constants for validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module containing predefined constants, blacklists, whitelists, and regex patterns for code analysis or linting. It does not perform any runtime operations, input processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. Usage of the data is intended for static code analysis, security checks, or linting enforcement. All values are safe and static. The code is well-structured, readable, and does not invoke or execute external or untrusted code. No suspicious patterns, hidden behaviors, or malicious intents are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module intended for use in code analysis or security validation tools. It contains only predefined, static data with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
