{
  "purpose": "Defines various constants, blacklists, whitelists, and patterns for a Python security analysis or linter tool aimed at enforcing secure coding practices and preventing misuse.",
  "sources": "Constants and lists are hardcoded within the module; no external input or data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "There are no functions or operations that handle untrusted data or inputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code does not establish any data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; it primarily defines static lists and patterns used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The lists and constants appear typical for a static analysis or security enforcement tool. No code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of constants, blacklists, whitelists, regex patterns, and configuration limits used for static code analysis, security enforcement, or linting. It contains no dynamic code, external inputs, or potentially malicious behavior. All elements serve as predefined constraints or reference lists. The structure and content are consistent with a security-focused configuration module. No anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage are found.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely provides static lists and configuration constants for security checks or code quality enforcement. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or harmful code. The overall security risk is minimal. It appears to be a benign, purpose-specific configuration module.",
