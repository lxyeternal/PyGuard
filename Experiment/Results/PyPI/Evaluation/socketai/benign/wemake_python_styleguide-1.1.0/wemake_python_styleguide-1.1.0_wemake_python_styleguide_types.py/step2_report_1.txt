  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the technical details, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static set of type alias definitions for AST nodes.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.\n- The code is well-commented and organized.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the clarity of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic or data processing.\n   - No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and purely for static analysis.\n   - No flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware: 0 in all reports, consistent with no malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, correct given the clarity.\n   - Risk: 0, appropriate as there's no security risk.\n   - Confidence: 1.0, justified by the straightforward nature and multiple consistent assessments.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - No reason to assign higher risk; the code is purely for type aliasing and documentation.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Correctly 0; no malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final justification:**\nThe code is a static, well-documented set of type aliases for AST nodes, used for static analysis tooling. There are no dynamic behaviors, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no suspicious patterns. The reports are accurate and align with my assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                       | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                       | Code is clear, well-commented, and straightforward.         |\n| Security Risk   | 0                       | No vulnerabilities or security issues present.              |\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No adjustments are necessary.",
