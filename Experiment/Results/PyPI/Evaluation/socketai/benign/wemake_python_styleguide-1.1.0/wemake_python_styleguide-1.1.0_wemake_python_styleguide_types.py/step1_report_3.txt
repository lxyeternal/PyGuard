  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various AST node types used for static code analysis and manipulation.",
  "sources": "The module reads data from the AST module and defines type aliases without external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in this static type definition code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type alias declaration module for AST nodes, used for code analysis or tooling. It imports the 'ast' module and defines several type aliases for different AST node types, organized logically for different Python constructs. No external input, network communication, or dynamic behavior is present. The code is purely declarative and structural, with no malicious intent or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious static type alias module with no security risks. It is purely for code analysis tooling and contains no harmful or malicious behavior.",
