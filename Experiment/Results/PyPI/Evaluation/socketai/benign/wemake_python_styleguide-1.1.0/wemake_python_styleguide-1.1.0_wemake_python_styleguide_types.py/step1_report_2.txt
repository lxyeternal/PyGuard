  "purpose": "Define type aliases for AST node types used in code analysis and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Type alias assignments, import statements, docstrings, comments.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output, external communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard type alias definitions with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions to streamline AST node handling in Python code analysis tools. It includes descriptive comments and documentation links. No runtime or malicious behavior is evident. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type aliases intended for use in static analysis or code inspection. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
