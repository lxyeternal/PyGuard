  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the underlying code based on the provided descriptions.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of static type alias definitions for AST node types.\n- It imports standard modules (`ast`, `typing`) and defines various `TypeAlias` types for use in static analysis or tooling.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, external communication, or data processing is present.\n- The comments and documentation are clear, and the code appears straightforward.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely declarative, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  **No.** All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, well-structured, and intended for static analysis.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. This is correct; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports. Since the code is purely declarative and contains no vulnerabilities, this is justified.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; all findings are based on static analysis.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the step-by-step review, the code is entirely benign and designed solely for static analysis purposes.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate, and the code does not warrant any concern regarding malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, well-documented, and serves a clear purpose in static analysis tooling.",
