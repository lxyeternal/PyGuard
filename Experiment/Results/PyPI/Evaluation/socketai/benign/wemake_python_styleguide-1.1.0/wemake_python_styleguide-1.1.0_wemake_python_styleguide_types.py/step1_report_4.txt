{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for AST node types used in code analysis and static type checking related to Python source code structure.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'ast' and 'typing' modules, type alias definitions throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code establishes type aliases for various AST node types but does not involve data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious commands or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines type aliases for AST node types using Python's typing module, facilitating static analysis or type checking. It includes comprehensive documentation and follows best practices for organizing complex type references. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in these definitions. The code is purely declarative, serving as a utility for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured set of type alias definitions intended for static code analysis or AST manipulation. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
