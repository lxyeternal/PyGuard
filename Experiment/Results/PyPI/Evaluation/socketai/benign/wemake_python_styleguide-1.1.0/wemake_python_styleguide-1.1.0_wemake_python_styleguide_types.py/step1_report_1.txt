{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various AST node types used in Python code analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (ast, typing) and defines type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only declares type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and well-commented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines multiple type aliases for AST node types, primarily for use in static analysis or code inspection tools. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or data leakage points are present. The code is purely declarative with clear comments explaining each alias. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type alias definitions intended to aid static code analysis. It contains no malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project focused on AST analysis, with no malicious intent.",
