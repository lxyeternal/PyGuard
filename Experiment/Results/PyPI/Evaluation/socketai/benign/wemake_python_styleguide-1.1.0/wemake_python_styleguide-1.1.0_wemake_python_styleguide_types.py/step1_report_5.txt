{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various AST node types used for static code analysis and processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'ast' module from Python's standard library and defines type aliases based on it.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; the code solely defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and does not process or execute data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The module strictly defines type aliases with no runtime logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'ast' module and creates multiple TypeAlias definitions to categorize different AST node types for static analysis purposes. No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or sensitive operations are present. It is a well-structured, purely declarative module intended to aid in static code processing. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured set of type alias definitions for AST nodes, intended for static analysis tooling. There are no indications of malware or security risks within this module.",
