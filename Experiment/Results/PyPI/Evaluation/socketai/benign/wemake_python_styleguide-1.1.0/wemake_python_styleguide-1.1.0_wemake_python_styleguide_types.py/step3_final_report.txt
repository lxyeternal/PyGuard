  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various AST node types used in static analysis and tooling.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'ast' and 'typing' modules, defining type aliases for AST nodes and constructs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static type alias definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A - static declarations only, no data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-commented, and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type aliases for AST nodes, used for static analysis tooling. It imports standard modules and defines various type aliases with descriptive comments. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, or external communications. The code is well-structured, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. Confidence is high (1.0) due to the clarity and simplicity. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code serves as a utility module for static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented set of static type aliases for AST nodes, with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
