  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as utility functions for AST analysis.\n- The functions are `is_literal`, `get_parent`, and `get_context`.\n- The code relies on custom attributes (`wps_parent`, `wps_context`) that are likely set externally.\n- The use of `ast.literal_eval` is standard and safe in this context.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted input are identified.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The reports confidently state the code is benign, with a confidence level of 1.\n\n**Confirmations & Discrepancies:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The reliance on custom attributes is typical in static analysis tools; no security concern arises from this alone.\n- The use of `ast.literal_eval` is safe here, as it only evaluates literals.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the consistent assessments.\n\n**Potential Issues & Recommendations:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, no changes to scores are necessary.\n- The only point to note is that the code assumes external setting of custom attributes; if these are manipulated maliciously elsewhere, that could pose a risk, but within this snippet, no such risk is evident.\n\n**Final Justification & Personal Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign utility for static AST analysis.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
