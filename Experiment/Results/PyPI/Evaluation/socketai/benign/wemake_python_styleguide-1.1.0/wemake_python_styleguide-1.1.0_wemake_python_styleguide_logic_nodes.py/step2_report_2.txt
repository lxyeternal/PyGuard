  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists of three utility functions:\n  - `is_literal(node)` attempts to evaluate the node with `ast.literal_eval`. If successful, it indicates the node contains only constants.\n  - `get_parent(node)` retrieves a custom attribute `'wps_parent'`.\n  - `get_context(node)` retrieves a custom attribute `'wps_context'`.\n\n- The code is safe in isolation:\n  - `ast.literal_eval` is a standard, safe way to evaluate literals.\n  - Attribute accessors are simple; they rely on external code to set these attributes.\n  - No external data, network, or execution is involved.\n\n- The attributes `'wps_parent'` and `'wps_context'` are non-standard and suggest integration with a larger static analysis framework, not malicious code.\n\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, no malicious intent or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Clear, safe utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior; functions are safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting `ast.literal_eval` as a potential sink, but correctly recognizing it evaluates AST nodes, not external data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 (originally)\n- **Justification for high risk score:** The code does not perform dangerous operations, but the report seems to assign a high risk score possibly due to overestimating `ast.literal_eval` as a security concern. Since `ast.literal_eval` is safe here, the risk should be minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with 0 for all.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified. The original 0.9 in report 5 seems unreasonable because the code does not perform any risky operations, nor does it process untrusted external data.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is a straightforward, safe utility module for static AST analysis.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The high risk score in report 5 should be lowered to 0, aligning with the others.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code appears entirely benign, with no evidence of security issues or malicious intent.",
