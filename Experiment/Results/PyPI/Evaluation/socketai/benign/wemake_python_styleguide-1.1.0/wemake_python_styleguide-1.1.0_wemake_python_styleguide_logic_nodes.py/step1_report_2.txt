  "purpose": "Utility functions for analyzing AST nodes, specifically checking for literals, retrieving parent nodes, and obtaining context information.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; only processes provided AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data; functions only inspect nodes and attributes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions do not process external inputs or produce side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom attributes ('wps_parent', 'wps_context') suggests integration with a specific framework, but no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple helper functions to analyze AST nodes, including checking if a node is a literal, retrieving a node's parent, and obtaining context. All operations are read-only and involve no external data or command execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The functions rely on the assumption that certain attributes are attached to AST nodes, possibly by an external framework or parser, but this does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module designed for AST analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
