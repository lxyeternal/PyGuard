  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence presented and the logical consistency of their assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides utility functions for AST node analysis:\n  - `is_literal(node)`: uses `ast.literal_eval` to determine if a node contains only constants.\n  - `get_parent(node)`: retrieves a custom attribute `'wps_parent'`.\n  - `get_context(node)`: retrieves a custom attribute `'wps_context'`.\n- The code does not perform any data transmission, external input/output, or code execution beyond evaluating AST nodes.\n- The use of custom attributes suggests integration into a larger static analysis framework.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5** all conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. They emphasize:\n- The functions operate only on provided AST nodes.\n- Use of `ast.literal_eval` is standard and safe.\n- Custom attributes are likely set elsewhere in a larger system.\n- No external data flow or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Common points:**\n- No evidence of malware.\n- No obfuscation.\n- No security risk.\n- The code appears safe for static analysis purposes.\n\n**Differences:**\n- Report 5 notes a potential concern about `ast.literal_eval` being a sink if evaluating untrusted data, but clarifies that in this context, it only evaluates AST nodes, not external input—so the risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that there are no issues, malware, or suspicious activity in this code snippet. The code is straightforward utility functions.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly identify that the code relies on attributes (`wps_parent`, `wps_context`) that are not standard but are presumably set elsewhere, which is typical in static analysis tools. No logical errors or false positives are evident.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n  Since no malicious activity, data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscation is present, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The use of `ast.literal_eval` is safe here because it evaluates AST nodes, not external data. No assumptions about malicious input are made.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n  No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n  No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n  No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a safe, utility module for static AST analysis, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| 0         | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity or code execution.  \n- No obfuscation patterns.  \n- No security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe reports are thorough and correctly interpret the code's intent and safety. No adjustments are necessary.",
