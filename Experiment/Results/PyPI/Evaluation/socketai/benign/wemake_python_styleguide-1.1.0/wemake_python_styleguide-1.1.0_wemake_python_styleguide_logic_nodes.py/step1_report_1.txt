{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for analyzing Python AST nodes, specifically to determine if a node is a literal, retrieve its parent, and get its context.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "targets": "None; the functions do not write or transmit data, nor do they interact with untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code operates solely on AST nodes passed as arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The functions rely on attributes 'wps_parent' and 'wps_context' that are not standard AST attributes. These may be set elsewhere in a larger system, but in isolation, they are just attribute accesses; no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for AST node inspection: 'is_literal' attempts to evaluate a node as a literal, catching ValueError to determine if it contains only constants. 'get_parent' and 'get_context' retrieve custom attributes from nodes, likely set by other parts of a static analysis or code style tool. There is no code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic within these functions. They appear safe and typical for static code analysis workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for static AST analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks by itself.",
