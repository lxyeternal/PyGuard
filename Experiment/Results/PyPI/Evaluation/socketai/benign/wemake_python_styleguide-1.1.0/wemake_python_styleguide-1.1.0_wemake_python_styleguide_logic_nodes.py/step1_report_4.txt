{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for analyzing AST nodes, specifically to check for literals, get parent nodes, and retrieve context information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the AST nodes provided as arguments, specifically the nodes' attributes such as 'wps_parent' and 'wps_context'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code where untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "The functions do not process or transform untrusted data; they merely retrieve attributes or evaluate literals, so there are no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed. The use of 'ast.literal_eval' is safe and standard for evaluating literals. The attribute accesses ('wps_parent', 'wps_context') suggest integration with a static analysis framework, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three helper functions for AST node analysis. 'is_literal' safely evaluates if a node contains only constants using 'ast.literal_eval', which is standard and safe. 'get_parent' and 'get_context' retrieve custom attributes, likely set elsewhere during analysis; these do not pose security concerns. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs present. The code appears to serve static analysis purposes without executing untrusted data or performing network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for AST analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions are straightforward and do not perform any harmful actions.",
