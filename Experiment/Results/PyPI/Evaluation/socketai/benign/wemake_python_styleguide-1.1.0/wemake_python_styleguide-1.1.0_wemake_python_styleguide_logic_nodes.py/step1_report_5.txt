{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing Python AST nodes, specifically checking if nodes are literals, retrieving parent nodes, and obtaining context information.",
  "sources": "The code reads AST nodes and their attributes, such as 'wps_parent' and 'wps_context'. It also attempts to evaluate nodes with ast.literal_eval.",
  "sinks": "The use of ast.literal_eval is a potential sink if it evaluates untrusted data; however, in this context, it only evaluates AST nodes, not external input.",
  "flows": "AST nodes are passed to is_literal to determine if they contain only constants; get_parent and get_context retrieve attributes from nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The functions are straightforward utility methods.",
  "analysis": "The code safely checks whether AST nodes are literals using ast.literal_eval, which is standard practice for evaluating constant expressions. The get_parent and get_context functions retrieve attributes from nodes, assuming these attributes are set elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code appears to be part of a larger static analysis tool, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign utility functions for AST analysis, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities detected.",
