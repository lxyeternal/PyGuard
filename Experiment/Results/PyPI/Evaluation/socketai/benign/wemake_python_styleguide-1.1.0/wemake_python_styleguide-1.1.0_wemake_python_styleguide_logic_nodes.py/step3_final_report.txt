  "purpose": "Utility functions for analyzing AST nodes: checking if a node contains only literals, retrieving parent nodes, and obtaining context attributes.",
  "sources": "Input AST nodes passed to functions; no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; functions do not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input nodes are evaluated or attributes are retrieved; no external data flow or malicious data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom attributes ('wps_parent', 'wps_context') which are likely set externally; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe utility functions for static AST analysis. 'is_literal' uses 'ast.literal_eval' safely to determine if a node contains only constants. 'get_parent' and 'get_context' retrieve custom attributes, likely set by external static analysis tools. No external data input, network activity, or code execution is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The functions are straightforward and rely on standard safe practices. The high confidence scores are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for static AST analysis with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe, standard practice code. The previously assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.",
