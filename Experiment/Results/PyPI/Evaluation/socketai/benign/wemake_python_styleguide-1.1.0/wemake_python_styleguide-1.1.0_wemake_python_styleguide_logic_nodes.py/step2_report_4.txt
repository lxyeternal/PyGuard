  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility for AST analysis, no malicious intent, no external data handling, no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The functions are straightforward, and the use of `ast.literal_eval` is safe. The custom attributes are likely set elsewhere and don't indicate malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's scoring seems appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard for static analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the functions are safe, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The use of `ast.literal_eval` is safe here, and attribute access is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious behavior, safe attribute access, no external data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a utility module, not executing untrusted data or performing harmful actions.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more cautious, noting that `ast.literal_eval` could be a sink if misused, but in context, it's safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9 (reported as 0.9)\n- **Assessment:** The high securityRisk score seems unwarranted. The code only evaluates AST nodes with `ast.literal_eval`, which is a safe operation when used on AST nodes, not external input. The functions do not process untrusted data or perform network operations.\n- **Justification for lowering the risk score:** The reasoning in the report indicates no actual security risk exists. The `ast.literal_eval` is used safely on AST nodes, not raw data. No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** Confirmed as 0, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Adjusted risk score:** I would recommend lowering the overall security risk score to **0**, as the code is safe and standard for static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign utility functions.\n- The only inconsistency is in Report 5's high securityRisk score, which I believe should be **0**.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Security risk score:** Should be **0** for all reports, including Report 5.\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at 0.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard utility module for static AST analysis with no malicious or security-risk elements.",
