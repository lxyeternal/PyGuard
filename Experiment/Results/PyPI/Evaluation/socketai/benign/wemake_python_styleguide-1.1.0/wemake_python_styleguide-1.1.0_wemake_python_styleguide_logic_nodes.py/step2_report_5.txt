  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides three utility functions:\n  - `is_literal(node)`: uses `ast.literal_eval` to determine if a node contains only constants.\n  - `get_parent(node)`: retrieves a custom attribute `wps_parent`.\n  - `get_context(node)`: retrieves a custom attribute `wps_context`.\n- No external input/output, no data flow from untrusted sources.\n- Uses standard safe practices (`ast.literal_eval`) for static analysis.\n- Relies on custom attributes, likely set elsewhere in a larger framework.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is benign, safe, and intended for static analysis.\n- They correctly identify that `ast.literal_eval` is used safely.\n- They note that `wps_parent` and `wps_context` are custom attributes, likely set elsewhere, with no malicious intent.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- They assign `malware` score = 0, `securityRisk` = 0, and `obfuscated` = 0, which are appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues in scoring:**\n- All reports agree on `malware=0` and `securityRisk=0`, which seems justified.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting the consensus.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The code appears safe and standard for static analysis.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate.  \n  The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports mention that `wps_parent` and `wps_context` are set elsewhere, which is a reasonable assumption given their non-standard nature.\n\n- **Is the use of `ast.literal_eval` safe here?**  \n  Yes. It evaluates only AST nodes, not external input, which is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n- Given the evidence, I agree with the assigned scores:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `risk`: 0\n\n- The confidence levels are appropriate; high confidence in benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward utility module for static analysis, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
