  "purpose": "Utility functions for analyzing AST nodes, specifically checking if nodes are literals, and retrieving parent and context nodes.",
  "sources": "AST nodes passed to functions 'is_literal', 'get_parent', and 'get_context'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input AST nodes are analyzed to determine literal status or retrieve parent/context; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for AST analysis: 'is_literal' safely evaluates whether a node contains only constants using 'ast.literal_eval', which is a standard, safe practice; 'get_parent' and 'get_context' retrieve attributes presumably set elsewhere, likely during AST traversal, without any dynamic or malicious behavior. There are no external data flows, no obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The functions are straightforward and intended for static code analysis or linting workflows. Overall, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains safe utility functions for analyzing AST nodes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a static analysis tool or style guide implementation, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
