  "purpose": "Retrieve package name and version information from the current module and its environment.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine the current file location; importing get_version to fetch version info from pyproject.toml.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Using __file__ to determine directory name, then passing package name to get_version to obtain version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution. The get_version function's behavior depends on external implementation but appears to be a standard utility.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its package name based on the directory containing the current file. It then retrieves the package version from pyproject.toml via get_version. Both operations are read-only, filesystem-based, and involve no user input or untrusted data. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs simple package metadata retrieval without any side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard package metadata retrieval without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
