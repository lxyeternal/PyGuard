{
  "purpose": "Determine the package name and version based on the directory structure and pyproject.toml file.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory name via __file__, and retrieves version info using get_version from wemake_python_styleguide.compat.packaging.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The source of data (file path and package name) is used to determine version info, with no flow leading to sensitive actions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. Usage of get_version appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path and Final for type annotations, retrieves the package directory name, and fetches the package version from pyproject.toml. All operations are standard and benign. There are no obfuscated code patterns, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network actions. The purpose is to programmatically determine package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign snippet to determine package name and version from project files. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
