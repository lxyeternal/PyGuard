  "purpose": "Retrieve the package name and version information for the project, likely for identification or logging.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__ to determine the directory name, and calling get_version() to retrieve version info from pyproject.toml.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data usage; no data is sent, stored insecurely, or executed.",
  "flows": "Path(__file__).parent.name -> assign to pkg_name; get_version(pkg_name) -> assign to pkg_version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Usage of get_version is standard, assuming it correctly retrieves version info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for path handling and version retrieval, then derives the package name from the directory name and fetches the version from pyproject.toml. All operations appear standard and intended for package metadata management. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended solely for metadata extraction within a package. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
