{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the package name from the directory structure and obtains the version number from the pyproject.toml file using a utility function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file path of the current script (__file__) to determine the package directory. It also calls get_version(pkg_name) to read version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "The script derives package name from the filesystem path and then retrieves version info from a configuration file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears straightforward, with standard usage of Path and a version retrieval function.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a package name based on the current file's directory name, then retrieves the package version from pyproject.toml via get_version(). There are no signs of obfuscation, suspicious dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. It relies on standard library features and a compatible import. The get_version function's implementation is not shown, but assuming it is a safe utility, the code performs typical package metadata extraction.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing standard package metadata retrieval with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
