{
  "purpose": "To determine the package name and version based on the directory structure and pyproject.toml metadata.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent.name to get the package directory name, get_version(pkg_name) to retrieve version info from pyproject.toml.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only reads metadata and filesystem information without untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "The code uses filesystem path to get package directory name, then retrieves version info from pyproject.toml via get_version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the package name based on the parent directory name, which is generally safe. It then retrieves the version using get_version from wemake_python_styleguide.compat.packaging, which is standard practice. No user input, network access, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup or metadata extraction routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard metadata extraction with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and safe.",
