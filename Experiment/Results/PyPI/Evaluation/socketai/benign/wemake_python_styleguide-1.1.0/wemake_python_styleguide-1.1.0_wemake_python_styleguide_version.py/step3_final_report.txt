  "purpose": "Retrieve the package name from the parent directory and obtain its version from pyproject.toml.",
  "sources": "Filesystem path of the current file (__file__), the parent directory, and the pyproject.toml via get_version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Path of __file__ to parent directory to package name, then package name to get_version to retrieve version.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward filesystem and metadata access with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, standard operations: determining package name from directory structure and retrieving version info via a utility. No user input, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The get_version function's safety depends on its implementation, but it is assumed to be a trusted utility. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The slight security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal filesystem access, which is typical and safe. Overall, the reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
