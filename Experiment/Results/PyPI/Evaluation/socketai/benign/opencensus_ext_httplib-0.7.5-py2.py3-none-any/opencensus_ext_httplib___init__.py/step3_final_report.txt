  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only licensing comments with no executable code or data flows, serving as licensing information for the project.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources, inputs, or external data reads; only static comments are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to vulnerabilities or data leaks, as there is no executable code.",
  "flows": "No data or control flows exist; the code is purely comments with no runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or hidden behaviors; the content is standard licensing boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no executable statements, data input/output, or control flow. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or security-related content. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely licensing comments with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
