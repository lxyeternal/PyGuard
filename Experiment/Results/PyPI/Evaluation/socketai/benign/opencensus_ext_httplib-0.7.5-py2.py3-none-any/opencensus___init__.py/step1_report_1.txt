{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources to include sub-packages or additional locations.",
  "sources": "The line imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python packaging; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the '__path__' variable using 'extend_path', which is a common pattern in Python packages to support namespace packages. It does not process user input, connect to external systems, or manipulate data in a way that could be malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard operation for Python package namespace extension and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
