  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses '__path__' and '__name__' variables which are standard in Python modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security issues are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and extends '__path__' using 'extend_path', which is a standard package resource management operation. No data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard Python practices for package resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module, which is a standard library module, and calls 'extend_path' on '__path__' with '__name__' as arguments. This is a common pattern in Python namespace packages to extend the package search path. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The operation is safe and typical in Python packaging scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for namespace package management in Python. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
