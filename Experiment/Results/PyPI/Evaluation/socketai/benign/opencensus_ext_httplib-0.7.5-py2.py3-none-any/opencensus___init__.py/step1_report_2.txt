  "purpose": "Extend the package search path for a namespace package.",
  "sources": "__path__ and __name__ variables, and the 'pkgutil' module import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions identified.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil', then extends __path__ using 'pkgutil.extend_path' with __path__ and __name__ as arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package extension; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to modify __path__, a common pattern for namespace packages in Python. It calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic present. The code is concise and typical for namespace package handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for extending the __path__ of a namespace package. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
