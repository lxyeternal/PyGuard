{
  "purpose": "This code extends the current module's __path__ to include additional paths for package data discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and accesses the __path__ and __name__ variables, which are part of Python's package import system.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used for further processing or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path, which is a standard method for handling namespace packages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of __import__ for 'pkgutil' is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends the __path__ variable for namespace package support. This pattern is common in namespace packages to aggregate multiple package directories. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are apparent. The code is minimal, clear, and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard approach for supporting namespace packages in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
