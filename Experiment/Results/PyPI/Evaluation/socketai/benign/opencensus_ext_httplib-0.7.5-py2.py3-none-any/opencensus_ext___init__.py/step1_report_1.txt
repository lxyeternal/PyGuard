  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses __import__ to call extend_path with __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' -> calling extend_path with __path__ and __name__ -> assignment to __path__",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard pattern for package namespace extension; no anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically extends the package's search path by calling 'pkgutil.extend_path' with the current __path__ and __name__. This is a common practice in namespace packages to aggregate multiple directories into a single package namespace. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secret data handling. The use of __import__ is standard in such contexts. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for package resource management.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a typical pattern for supporting namespace packages and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a legitimate, safe construct with no indication of obfuscation or malware.",
