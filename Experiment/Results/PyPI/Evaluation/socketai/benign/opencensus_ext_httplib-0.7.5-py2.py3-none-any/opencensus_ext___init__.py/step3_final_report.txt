  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages in Python, extending __path__ using pkgutil's extend_path.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' via __import__('pkgutil') and use of __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or data leaks; no malicious code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path(__path__, __name__) -> assign result back to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ instead of direct import; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__, which is a common and benign practice. No untrusted data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify this as a safe, well-known pattern with no malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence levels. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for namespace package support in Python. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The existing reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
