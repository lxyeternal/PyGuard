{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package resource discovery",
  "sources": "__path__ and __name__ variables, and the pkgutil module import",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leak points",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__ using pkgutil's extend_path, which is a standard operation for namespace packages",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses its extend_path function to extend __path__ with additional locations, facilitating namespace package support. This is a standard pattern in Python packages that are split across multiple directories or distributions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no input/output operations involving untrusted data, and no obfuscated code present. The code is minimal and straightforward, aligned with typical namespace package implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard operation to support namespace packages without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and common in Python package development.",
