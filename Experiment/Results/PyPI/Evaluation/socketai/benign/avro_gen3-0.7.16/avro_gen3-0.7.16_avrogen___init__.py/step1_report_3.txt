{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports by importing specific functions from local schema and protocol modules and setting __all__ for export control.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from relative modules: .schema and .protocol.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The imported functions could be called elsewhere; within this code, there is no data flow to or from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed. The code is straightforward and only manages imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions from local modules and declares an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or other potentially malicious actions. The structure indicates standard module setup in Python. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely manages imports and exports. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
