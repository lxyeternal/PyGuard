{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific functions from sibling modules (.schema and .protocol) and defines an __all__ list to specify the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .schema and .protocol modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flow from untrusted sources; __all__ declaration exports functions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports functions and declares an export list. It contains no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign full confidence scores, and do not find any security issues or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
