{
  "purpose": "The code exports functions related to schema and protocol generation and writing, likely part of a larger module or package.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from internal modules (.schema and .protocol). No input data reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present. The code does not process untrusted data or execute any sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this code snippet. It solely manages module exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules and sets __all__ for module exports. It is a typical __init__.py style module to define the public API. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. No data handling, input/output operations, or code execution is present. The structure is clear, and there are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization file that exports specific functions for use elsewhere. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It is a safe and typical pattern for organizing Python packages.",
