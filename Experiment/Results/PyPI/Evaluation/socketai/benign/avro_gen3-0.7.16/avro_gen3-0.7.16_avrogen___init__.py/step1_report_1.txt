  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports functions from sibling modules 'schema' and 'protocol' and defines an __all__ list for export.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing specific functions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply imports functions and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports of functions from local modules and declares __all__ for module exports. It contains no data processing, user input handling, or network operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observable based solely on these import and export statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply manages imports and exports within a package.",
