  "sources": "Input parameters 'ns' and 'name' for make_fullname; 'fullname' parameter for split_fullname and get_shortname.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems, files, or network resources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; functions process strings and do not interact with external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic string manipulation functions to construct and split names with optional namespace prefixes. There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. Functions are straightforward and serve as utility helpers. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple, benign utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
