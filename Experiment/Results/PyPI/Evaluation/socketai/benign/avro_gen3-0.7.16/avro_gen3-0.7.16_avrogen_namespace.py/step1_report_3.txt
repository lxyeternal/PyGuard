  "purpose": "Utility functions for manipulating and splitting full names or namespace-qualified names.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ns' and 'name' in make_fullname, and 'fullname' in split_fullname and get_shortname.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions only perform string concatenation and splitting.",
  "flows": "None; data flows are limited to local string operations without external data or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs straightforward string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three simple functions: make_fullname constructs a full name with optional namespace; split_fullname divides a full name into namespace and name components; get_shortname retrieves the name part from a full name. All operations are based solely on string concatenation and slicing, with no input validation, external calls, or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be harmless utility functions with no malicious intent. It performs basic string manipulations without external dependencies or unsafe operations.",
