  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling and manipulating fully qualified names, likely in a namespace context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ns' and 'name' in make_fullname, 'fullname' in split_fullname and get_shortname.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output concatenated or sliced strings; no external data or sensitive information is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Concatenate 'ns' and 'name' in make_fullname; parse 'fullname' to extract namespace and short name; retrieve short name from 'fullname'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform straightforward string manipulations: concatenation and splitting based on a delimiter. No external data sources, no network calls, no data leaks, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears clean, simple, and purpose-specific, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious logic. All operations are standard string handling routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements basic string manipulation functions for namespace and fullname handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
