  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of an Avro JSON serialization/deserialization utility with validation and schema resolution. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors are evident. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the absence of suspicious patterns or external malicious behavior."
