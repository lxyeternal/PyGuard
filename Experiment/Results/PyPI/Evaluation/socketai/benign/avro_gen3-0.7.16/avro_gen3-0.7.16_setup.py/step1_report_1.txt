{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'avro-gen3' Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the project directory to load README.md for long description; static package metadata and dependencies are hardcoded within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to insecure actions; the setup script primarily reads static files and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content -> passes metadata and dependencies to setuptools.setup() -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard setuptools conventions. No suspicious network or system calls.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules for file and path handling, then checks for the existence of README.md to include as a long description. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data. The setup() function is used as intended for Python package configuration. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or network operations. All elements are static and conform to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies, with no external code execution or data leakage points.",
