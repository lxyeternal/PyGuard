  "purpose": "Standard Python setup.py script for packaging a project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; static metadata and dependencies; no untrusted input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports necessary modules, reads a local README file if present, and calls setup() with static project metadata, dependencies, and package data. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight elevation of risk to 0.1 in one report is marginal and justified only if considering dependency trust, but the script itself remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The risk score should be 0 across all reports; the 0.1 in one report can be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
