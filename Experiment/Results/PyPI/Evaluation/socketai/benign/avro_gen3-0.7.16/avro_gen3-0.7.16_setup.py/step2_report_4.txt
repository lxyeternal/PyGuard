  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup.py script, reads README.md, defines metadata, dependencies, package data. No suspicious code, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues identified. No reason to adjust scores.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup.py, no suspicious behavior, static data.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also a standard setup script, no suspicious code, no dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar setup script, reads README.md, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Note:** The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) is likely due to the fact that it involves reading local files and package metadata, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, no suspicious code, no dynamic execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is correct given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Almost all are 0, with one at 0.1, which is reasonable given the static nature of the script.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The only minimal concern is reading a local README file, which does not pose a security risk.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (very low, justified by the minimal file I/O, but no actual security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is entirely benign and conforms to standard Python packaging practices. No adjustments needed beyond the existing low risk score.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0.0** (or at most 0.1, but 0.0 is justified)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or more detailed assessment.",
