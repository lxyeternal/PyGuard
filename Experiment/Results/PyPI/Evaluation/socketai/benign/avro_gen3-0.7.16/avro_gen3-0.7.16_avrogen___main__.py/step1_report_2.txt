{
  "purpose": "This script processes an Avro IDL file and generates protocol files, with optional output directory specification.",
  "sources": "Reads the filename from command line arguments (argv), reads the content of the specified file.",
  "sinks": "The open() function reads data from a file specified by user input; write_protocol_files() processes the file content.",
  "flows": "Command line argument parsing -> reading file content -> passing content to write_protocol_files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The use of open() with user input is standard for file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to determine input file and output directory, then reads the input file's content and calls an external function to process it. Error handling simply re-raises exceptions after printing documentation, which is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code relies on external library 'write_protocol_files' and standard Python modules. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for processing protocol files with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
