  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for managing indentation in text output. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (e.g., 0.1) to account for potential misuse if the inner_writer is malicious. The confidence in this assessment is high (1)."
