  "purpose": "A utility class for managing indented writing to an inner writer object, supporting context management for indentation levels.",
  "sources": "Input comes from method parameters such as 'text' in 'write' and 'inner_writer' provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The 'write' method outputs data to the 'inner_writer' object; no untrusted data flows to external sinks within this code.",
  "flows": "Text passed to 'write' flows from the input parameter to the 'inner_writer'. The indentation management modifies internal state but does not affect data flow externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code uses standard indentation logic and context managers.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility class for handling indentation in writing operations. It uses assertions to verify input types and manages internal indentation state. The 'write' method handles multiline strings carefully, inserting the current indentation after each newline. The class provides methods for adjusting indentation levels. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or obfuscation. The use of 'six' ensures compatibility across Python versions but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for formatted output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard indentation management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended without any suspicious or harmful code features.",
