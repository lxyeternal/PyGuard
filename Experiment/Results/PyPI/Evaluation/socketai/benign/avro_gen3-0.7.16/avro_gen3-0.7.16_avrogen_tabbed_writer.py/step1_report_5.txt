{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class 'TabbedWriter' that manages writing text with indentation control, supporting context-based indentation through the nested 'Indent' class.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the 'write' method parameter 'text' and the 'inner_writer' object provided at initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the 'inner_writer.write()' calls which output text. However, these depend on the 'inner_writer' implementation.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from the 'write()' method to 'inner_writer.write()' calls, with indentation level managed internally via 'set_tab', 'tab', and 'untab' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code behavior. The 'six' import ensures compatibility but is standard. The indentation management appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to write text with indentation control, using context managers for clean indentation scope handling. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The 'six' library usage is benign. The logic for handling newlines and indentation is standard and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured text writer utility with indentation support. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this module.",
