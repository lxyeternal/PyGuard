{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class 'TabbedWriter' which manages writing text with indentation, useful for pretty-printing or generating formatted output.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided through the 'write' method, which receives text to be output. There are no external data sources or inputs other than function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the 'self.__inner_writer.write' method, where data is written to an underlying writer object.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'write' method input to the underlying writer, with internal management of indentation levels through 'tab' and 'untab' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; code appears straightforward with standard indentation management. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The class manages indentation levels with a counter and a string representing the current indentation. It handles multi-line text, inserting indentation after newline characters. The 'Indent' nested class provides a context manager for temporary indentation adjustments. Usage of 'six.string_types' ensures compatibility across Python versions. There are no external data fetches, network calls, or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for managing indented text output. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are evident.",
