  "purpose": "Utility class for managing indentation when writing text, supporting nested indentation levels via context management.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the write() method, internal indentation state (__tabs, __current_tab).",
  "sinks": "Writing to the inner_writer object, which outputs the formatted text.",
  "flows": "Input text -> write() processes text, inserts indentation after newlines -> output to inner_writer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation. Minor note: find() used repeatedly could be optimized, but not a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple indentation management utility with context support. It uses standard string operations, assertions for input validation, and maintains internal state for indentation levels. No external network, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of 'six' ensures compatibility across Python versions. The write() method correctly handles multiline strings, inserting indentation after each newline. The inner class Indent provides a context manager for temporary indentation changes. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are detected. The only minor consideration is that the inner_writer could be malicious if untrusted, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code is benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for managing indentation in text output. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (e.g., 0.1) to account for potential misuse if the inner_writer is malicious. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
