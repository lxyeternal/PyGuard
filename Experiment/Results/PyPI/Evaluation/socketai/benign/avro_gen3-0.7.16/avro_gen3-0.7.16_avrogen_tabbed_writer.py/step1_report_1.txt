{
  "purpose": "The code implements a tabbed text writer class that manages indentation levels for writing formatted text to an inner writer object.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings in the write() method and uses the internal indentation state.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks, network operations, or data leaks. No untrusted data handling beyond string writing is present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed and written to the inner writer with appropriate indentation. No data flow to external systems or untrusted sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code performs standard string manipulation and indentation management.",
  "analysis": "The class manages indentation levels for writing text, using an inner writer object. It employs context management for indentation, updates indentation levels, and writes text with proper indentation. The code relies on standard Python features and the 'six' library for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and typical of a code formatting utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a formatted text writer with indentation management. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
