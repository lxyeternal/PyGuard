  "purpose": "A utility class for writing indented text to an inner writer, supporting context management for indentation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__, input to write() method, and internal method calls",
  "sinks": "write() method calls on the inner writer with the provided text",
  "flows": "Input text -> write() method -> inner_writer.write() with possibly inserted indentation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious string manipulations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code detected. Use of 'six' is for compatibility; no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple indentation utility class with context management via the Indent inner class. It manages indentation levels and writes formatted text to an underlying writer. No data leaks, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious code flows or hardcoded credentials. The class appears to be a straightforward text formatting utility. There are no sources of untrusted data beyond method inputs; the sink is the inner writer, which is assumed to be a safe output object. The code is well-structured and standard, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign indentation utility designed for formatted text output. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard, safe utility class.",
