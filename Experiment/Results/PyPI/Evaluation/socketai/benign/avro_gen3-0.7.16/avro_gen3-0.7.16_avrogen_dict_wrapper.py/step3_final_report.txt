  "purpose": "A schema-based data wrapper class facilitating serialization and validation through external JSON/Avro converters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, class variables, external module 'avrogen.avrojson' during conversion methods.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions that process data for serialization; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal dictionary to JSON/Avro via converter methods, with dynamic import of external module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import for 'avrogen.avrojson' is typical; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward schema-based data wrapper with serialization functions relying on external modules. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import is a common pattern for optional dependencies. The internal '_construct' method bypasses validation but is marked internal, reducing risk. No network, file, or system modifications are evident. The security risk primarily hinges on the trustworthiness of the external 'avrogen.avrojson' module, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe data handling class with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, mainly due to reliance on external modules. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
