  "purpose": "Unit tests for the datetime_almost_equal function, verifying datetime comparisons with various delta scenarios.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded datetime objects within test methods",
  "sinks": "No external data, no data leaks, no network activity",
  "flows": "Input datetimes are compared within the test assertions; no external data flow involved",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign unit test suite that imports datetime and a function from almost_equal. It performs internal comparisons with hardcoded data, with no external data handling, network activity, or secrets. All reports agree on its benign nature, with high confidence and malware scores of 0. The security risk scores are very low (~0.1), justified by the test-oriented, non-sensitive nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The import 'almost_equal' appears legitimate, and the code structure is typical of testing modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward unit test suite with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
