  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'datetime_almost_equal' function from the 'almost_equal' module, verifying datetime comparison logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements and creation of datetime objects for test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; all data used is internal and hardcoded.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; test inputs are predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly performs straightforward test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class with methods to verify the correctness of a datetime comparison function. All data is hardcoded and used solely within test assertions. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. No network operations, no data leaks, no credential handling, or other suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a datetime comparison function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
