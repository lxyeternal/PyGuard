  "purpose": "Unit tests for the astral.Observer class to verify its behavior with various input formats and boundary conditions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; all data are hardcoded or constructed within the test methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; tests merely instantiate objects and check attributes.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from external sources to sinks; all operations are internal assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior detected. The tests appear straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test cases for a class named Observer, validating default values, different input formats, boundary conditions, and exception handling. All data are hardcoded within the tests; no user input, network access, or external dependencies are involved. The assertions and exception checks follow standard testing patterns. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is clean, readable, and consistent with typical unit testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for the Observer class without any malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It does not perform any data leaks, network communication, or system modifications. The overall risk is negligible.",
