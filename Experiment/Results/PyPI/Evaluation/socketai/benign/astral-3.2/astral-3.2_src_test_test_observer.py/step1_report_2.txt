  "purpose": "Unit tests for the astral.Observer class to verify correct initialization and behavior.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are present; all data comes from hardcoded test parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data is being sent to external systems or processed in a way that could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Test instantiations and assertions do not involve data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code strictly performs assertions on expected values.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests using pytest to verify the functionality of the Observer class. It creates instances with various parameters, including defaults, strings, and DMS notation, then asserts expected attribute values. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling of untrusted inputs is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are identified. The tests seem straightforward and typical for unit testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard test code verifying the behavior of a class. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. The code appears safe and purely for testing class functionality.",
