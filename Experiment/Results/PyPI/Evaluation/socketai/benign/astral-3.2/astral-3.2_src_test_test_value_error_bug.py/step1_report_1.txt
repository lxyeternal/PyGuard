  "purpose": "Calculate sunrise times for a specific location and date using the astral library.",
  "sources": "Imports astral, astral.sun, datetime, and uses hardcoded location info in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data output points present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only processes hardcoded data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials other than location info, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test function that creates a LocationInfo object with static location data, then calculates the sun information for a fixed date, and accesses the 'dawn' value. No external input, no network communication, no sensitive data handling. The code appears to be a straightforward use of the astral library for solar calculations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of using the astral library to compute sunrise data for a specified location and date. No malicious intent, no security risks identified.",
