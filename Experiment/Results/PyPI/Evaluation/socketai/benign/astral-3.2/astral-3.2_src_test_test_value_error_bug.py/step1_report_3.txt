  "purpose": "Calculate sunrise times for a specific location and date using the astral library.",
  "sources": "import statements for datetime and astral libraries; creation of LocationInfo object; calling astral.sun.sun with observer info and date.",
  "sinks": "Accessing the 'dawn' key from the sun dictionary; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Input from user or environment (not present here) flows into the astral library functions via location and date; the output is sunrise data stored in 'sun' and 'dawn'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage appears straightforward and intended for solar calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up a geographic location with fixed coordinates, calculates sunrise times for a specific date, and retrieves the dawn time. There are no external inputs, no network activity, no code injection, nor any suspicious behavior. The function is a simple utility for solar data calculation. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for solar calculations using the astral library. It performs standard operations without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
