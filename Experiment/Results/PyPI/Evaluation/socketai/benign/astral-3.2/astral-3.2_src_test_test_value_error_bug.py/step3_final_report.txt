  "purpose": "Calculate dawn time for a fixed location and date using the astral library.",
  "sources": "Static location data within the code (name, region, timezone, latitude, longitude).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; purely local computation.",
  "flows": "LocationInfo object creation -> astral.sun.sun() function -> access to 'dawn' key.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward use of a well-known library with static data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a test function creating a LocationInfo object with fixed parameters, and computes the dawn time for a specific date. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved. The code performs a benign astronomical calculation with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The security and malware scores are appropriately low (0), reflecting the benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and static data. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for solar calculations using the astral library. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
