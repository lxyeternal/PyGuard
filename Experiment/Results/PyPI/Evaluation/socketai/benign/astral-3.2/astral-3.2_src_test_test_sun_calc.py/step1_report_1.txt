{
  "purpose": "The code is a series of unit tests for the 'sun' module in the 'astral' library, verifying astronomical calculations related to the sun's position, such as azimuth, elevation, declination, and related solar angles.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters (e.g., float values, date objects), environment variables (indirectly via imported modules), and data generated from date/time functions and test parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs include assertions comparing computed values to expected approximations. There are no data leaks, system modifications, or network operations present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through astronomical calculation functions, and results are compared against expected values via assertions. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted beyond test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a testing suite, with typical use of pytest, parameterization, and astronomical calculations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are observed. The import of 'freezegun' is standard for testing time-dependent functions. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test functions validating astronomical calculations in the 'sun' module. It uses parameterized tests with known values and asserts to check correctness. The imported modules are standard for testing and date/time handling. There are no indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or sabotage. All code appears to be legitimate testing logic for validating computations. The presence of third-party libraries (pytest, freezegun) is typical and not suspicious. No source-to-sink malicious flows, hardcoded secrets, or network operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, legitimate test suite for astronomical calculations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to verify correctness of the 'sun' module's computations and does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
