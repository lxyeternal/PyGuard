{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for the astral library, specifically testing sunrise and sunset calculations for a location in Norway.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'tromso' Location object, and the 'dt' datetime object. It also calls functions from the 'astral.sun' module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, execute untrusted input, or invoke system commands. No sinks indicate potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input location and date data are processed to compute sun events, but no untrusted data flows into potentially malicious sinks; the flow is limited to library function calls for astronomical calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code uses standard Python features and well-defined external libraries for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines a helper function to find the next sun event, and contains a test function for a specific geographic location. It handles expected errors using pytest.raises and asserts logical ordering of sun events. There is no indication of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or supply chain attacks. The code is a typical test setup for astronomical calculations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for the astral library, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs astronomical calculations and testing logic without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
