  "purpose": "Define static location data fixtures for testing the 'astral' library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within fixture functions creating LocationInfo and Location objects.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assigned directly within fixtures without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a commented-out line in one fixture; otherwise, no anomalies or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of pytest fixtures that instantiate LocationInfo and Location objects with static, hardcoded data. There are no external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution involved. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or secret handling are present. The code is straightforward and intended for testing purposes. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. No logical flaws or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of test fixtures with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
