  "purpose": "Define fixtures for testing the 'astral' library's location-related classes and data.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from 'pytest' and 'astral', especially 'LocationInfo', 'LocationDatabase', 'database', and 'Location'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval are present.",
  "flows": "The code only creates and returns data objects; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code in 'london_info' fixture; no suspicious code, secrets, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward set of pytest fixtures that instantiate and return objects from the 'astral' library for location data. No dynamic execution, external data reads, or malicious behavior is evident. The only notable aspect is a commented-out line, which is benign and common in development. There are no signs of obfuscation, code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code strictly serves as test setup without external or hidden actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test fixture setup for location data objects; no malicious activity, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
