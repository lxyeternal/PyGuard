{
  "purpose": "The code defines pytest fixtures for testing the 'astral' library's Location and LocationInfo classes with predefined location data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from within the fixture functions, such as location names, coordinates, and timezone strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data is processed or transmitted. There are no data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "The fixtures create Location and LocationInfo objects from static data; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard library functions and static data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up test fixtures with static, hardcoded location information. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The use of standard classes and functions indicates normal behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or covert data exfiltration. The fixtures facilitate testing of the 'astral' library's location handling capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward test setup code that contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It is safe and appears to serve as part of testing infrastructure.",
