  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'astral' Python package, intended to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads static package configuration data, such as package names, versions, descriptions, author info, dependencies, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sinks; no data leakage or execution of untrusted code present.",
  "flows": "Uses static data to configure package setup without dynamic or external input; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Maintains standard setup conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setuptools setup configuration file. It imports 'setup' from setuptools, defines package directories, dependencies, and metadata, then calls setup() with these parameters. All data appears static and directly related to package configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. No obfuscation or unusual constructs are present. The script adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
