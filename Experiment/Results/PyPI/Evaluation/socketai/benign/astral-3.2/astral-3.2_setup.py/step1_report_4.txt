  "purpose": "This script is for setting up the 'astral' Python package, specifying its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data, dependency specifications, and metadata fields from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted or external data; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; all data is static or predefined within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or unusual behavior are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools. It defines package directories, dependencies, and metadata. There are no indicators of malicious activity, such as network communication, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted inputs. The script appears to be a typical, legitimate setup configuration for an open-source Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely defines package information and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful code.",
