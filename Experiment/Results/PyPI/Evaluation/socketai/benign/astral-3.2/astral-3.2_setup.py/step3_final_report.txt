  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data definitions: package_dir, packages, package_data, extras_require, setup_kwargs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual setting of 'maintainer' and 'maintainer_email' to string 'None', but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code, external data, or network activity. It contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. All fields are hardcoded, and the structure follows standard packaging practices. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are present. The 'maintainer' fields set to 'None' as strings are unconventional but harmless. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
