  "purpose": "Unit tests for the LocationInfo class from the astral library, verifying default values, input validation, timezone grouping, and tzinfo correctness.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of LocationInfo, attribute access, exception handling for invalid inputs, import statements for zoneinfo",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, no external network calls, no data leaks or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Input parameters to LocationInfo constructor, attribute access to verify values, exception assertions for invalid inputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, straightforward test code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests with no malicious behavior, external data flow, or obfuscation. It performs input validation and verifies class attributes. The import fallback for zoneinfo is a common compatibility pattern. No network activity or dynamic code execution is present. The code is safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing the LocationInfo class, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its benign nature.",
