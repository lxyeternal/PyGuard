  "purpose": "Unit tests for the LocationInfo class in the astral library to verify default values, input validation, timezone grouping, and timezone info.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, astral, zoneinfo/backports.zoneinfo; test methods calling LocationInfo constructor and accessing its attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file system, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Test inputs (like invalid latitude/longitude) to LocationInfo constructor, then check for exceptions or attribute values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code strictly performs unit testing without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and the LocationInfo class, then defines several test cases to verify default values, input validation, and timezone info. It uses standard assertions and exception handling. No dynamic code execution, no data leakage, and no external communication or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a Python library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs validation checks and assertions typical of testing environments, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
