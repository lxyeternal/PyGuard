  "purpose": "Unit tests for the LocationInfo class in the astral library to verify default values, error handling, and timezone information.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pytest, astral.LocationInfo, and zoneinfo; test methods calling LocationInfo with various parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that process untrusted input; tests assert expected attribute values.",
  "flows": "Input data provided to LocationInfo constructor (e.g., location name, region, timezone, latitude, longitude) flows into the class and its methods. No untrusted external data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code is standard for unit testing, with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a test class with multiple test cases verifying the behavior of LocationInfo. It tests default initialization, error handling for invalid latitude and longitude, timezone group retrieval, and tzinfo attribute. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for testing purposes, without external network calls or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a Python class, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs validation and attribute checking without engaging in any unsafe operations or external data leaks.",
