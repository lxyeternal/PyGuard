  "purpose": "Unit tests for the LocationInfo class in the astral package, validating default values, input validation, and timezone handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest, astral.LocationInfo, zoneinfo or backports.zoneinfo, and test methods creating LocationInfo instances.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and exceptions handling within test methods; no data sinks or external data flows observed.",
  "flows": "Test execution creates LocationInfo objects and validates their attributes; no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward test code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and the LocationInfo class, performs standard validation tests on object attributes, and handles ImportError for zoneinfo fallback. All operations are typical for unit tests with no external data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs validation on the LocationInfo class attributes in a typical manner.",
