  "purpose": "Unit tests for the LocationInfo class from the astral package to verify default values, input validation, and timezone info.",
  "sources": "Import statements, test method invocations, and LocationInfo instantiations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing using pytest for the astral.LocationInfo class, checking default values, exception raising for invalid inputs, and timezone information. It imports 'zoneinfo' or a backport version depending on environment, which is a common compatibility approach. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The overall security risk is negligible.",
