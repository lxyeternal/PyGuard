  "purpose": "Package setup script for configuring and installing the Python package, including data files and platform-specific permissions.",
  "sources": "Reading files (read function), os.walk for data files, sys.platform check for MacOS permission change.",
  "sinks": "os.chmod on a specific binary to set executable permissions on MacOS.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources; the only flow is setting permissions on a known binary after package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no external network activity, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing file reading, data collection, dependency specification, and setting executable permissions on MacOS. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data flows. The permission change is a common, benign step in packaging for MacOS. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The permission modification on MacOS is routine and not malicious. All signals indicate a safe and typical packaging process.",
