  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'mm', configuring package metadata, dependencies, data files, and executable scripts.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, codecs.open, os.walk, sys.platform, os.stat, os.chmod",
  "sinks": "os.chmod, os.stat, sys.platform",
  "flows": "Reading file paths and contents -> setting file permissions based on platform",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code performs typical setup operations with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package files, manages dependencies, and sets executable permissions on a Mac platform. All functions perform standard setup tasks. No external data inputs are processed in a way that could lead to code injection or data leaks. The permission modification on Mac is a typical operation to make an app executable and does not appear malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It simply prepares the package for distribution with no suspicious activities.",
