  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script, performing package configuration, data file collection, and a platform-specific permission change.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data flows.\n- The only platform-specific action is changing permissions on a MacOS executable, which is a common and benign practice in packaging.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Finds no malicious activity.\n- Correctly notes the permission change is typical.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n- The score aligns with the conclusion.\n\n**Verdict:** Accept scores as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1; emphasizes that the permission change is benign.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is reasonable given the platform-specific change.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- No suspicious activity.\n- The reasoning is consistent; the permission change is standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Accept scores as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Reiterates that no malicious activity is detected.\n- Focuses on the standard nature of the setup process.\n- Confidence: 0.9, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The analysis is consistent.\n- No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accept scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Similar to previous, confirms no malicious intent.\n- Notes the permission change as typical.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The reasoning is sound.\n- No suspicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accept scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Emphasizes the standard nature of the script.\n- Notes the permission change as normal.\n- Confidence: 1, Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- Correct assessment; no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accept scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The only platform-specific action is setting executable permissions on a MacOS binary, which is common and benign.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1) is justified, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
