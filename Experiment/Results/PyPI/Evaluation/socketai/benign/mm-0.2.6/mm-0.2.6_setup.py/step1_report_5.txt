  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mm' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, data files, and entry points.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, os.walk, os.stat, sys.platform, codecs.open, find_packages, get_data_files, and the commented-out code related to requirements.",
  "sinks": "os.chmod (for setting executable permissions), os.walk (for directory traversal), codecs.open (for reading files), and package metadata assignments.",
  "flows": "read() function reads files; get_data_files() traverses directories; setup() uses this data for package configuration; os.stat and os.chmod modify file permissions based on platform.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs standard setup operations. The only notable operation is changing file permissions on macOS, which is normal for ensuring executable permissions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and setup tools for packaging a Python module. It defines helper functions to read files and gather data files. The setup() function specifies package info, dependencies, and entry points. The conditional block for Darwin modifies file permissions for a specific executable, which is a common practice on macOS. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. All operations are consistent with package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only notable operation is setting execute permissions on macOS, which is normal for ensuring the proper execution of a bundled app component.",
