  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios related to Salesforce integration and internal application errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely defines classes and docstrings without external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, I/O operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no runtime data flows or data processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings; no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base class. Each class includes docstrings explaining its purpose, especially for Salesforce-related errors. There are no methods, no data processing, and no interactions with external systems or inputs. The classes serve as error types for catching specific error conditions in other parts of the application. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. The code appears clean, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of straightforward exception class definitions used for error handling in a Salesforce-integrated application. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
