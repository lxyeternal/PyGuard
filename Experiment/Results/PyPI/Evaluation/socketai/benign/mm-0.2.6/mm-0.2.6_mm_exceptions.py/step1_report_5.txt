  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in a Salesforce or related system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive sinks; these are simple class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines multiple custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings for various error scenarios, mostly related to Salesforce. There are no input handling, data processing, or external interactions. The structure and content are straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard, static class declarations for exception handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of standard exception class definitions with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application, serving as a framework for error handling.",
