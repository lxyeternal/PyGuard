  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of straightforward custom exception class definitions.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is to categorize errors, primarily related to Salesforce integrations.\n- No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  **Yes.** The reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with descriptive docstrings, with no malicious or suspicious content.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reasoning is consistent and accurate; the code is simple and standard.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0`  \n  These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justify risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  **Not applicable.** All scores are 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports are based on factual analysis of the code structure.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors are present.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security concerns. The reports correctly reflect this, and no changes are necessary.",
