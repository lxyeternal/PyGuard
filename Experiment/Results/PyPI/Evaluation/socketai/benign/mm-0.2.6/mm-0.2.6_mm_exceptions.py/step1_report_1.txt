  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to Salesforce integrations and general application errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data comes from exception handling contexts within the application.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; no output or data handling beyond raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are used for control flow in error handling, not for data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings. These classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class and are used for specific error handling scenarios. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, and no code execution logic. The structure and content are typical for a module intended to standardize exception handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Salesforce-related Python application. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and presents no security risks. It is likely part of a larger codebase to handle errors consistently.",
