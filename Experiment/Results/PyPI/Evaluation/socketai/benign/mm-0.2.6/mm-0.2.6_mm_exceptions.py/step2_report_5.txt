  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data processing are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly to categorize error conditions, especially related to Salesforce.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The code matches the description: multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings.\n- No code logic, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or payloads.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- The reports are accurate; no issues are present in the code.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence is 1 for all, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The purpose, analysis, and conclusion are consistent across reports.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no dynamic or external components, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- No reason to adjust scores upward.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is static and benign.\n- The reports correctly identify that there's no malicious intent or security concern.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues. The reports are accurate and thorough.",
