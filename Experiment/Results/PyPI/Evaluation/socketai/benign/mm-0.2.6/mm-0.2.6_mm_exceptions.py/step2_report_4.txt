  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of straightforward custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings.  \n   - No external data, network activity, or code execution logic is present.  \n   - The classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class, with no methods or dynamic behavior.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   - The reports are consistent, thorough, and correctly identify that the code is purely static class definitions.  \n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.  \n   - The summaries accurately reflect the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   - All reports assign:  \n     - Malware: 0  \n     - Obfuscated: 0  \n     - Security Risk: 0  \n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.  \n   - The code is standard, safe, and intended for error handling.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.  \n   - No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - All claims are based on direct analysis of the code, not assumptions.  \n   - The code is straightforward, and the analysis correctly identifies its benign nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-documented set of exception classes for a Salesforce-related Python application.  \n- It is a typical pattern for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.  \n- The high confidence scores (1) across reports are justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and serves as a foundational component for error handling. No changes to scores or further investigation are necessary.",
