  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of straightforward custom exception class definitions.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data processing are involved.\n- The classes have descriptive docstrings, and there are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The code is standard, static, and intended for error handling within a larger application.\n\n**Confirmation of Issues:**\n- The code does **not** contain any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The exception classes are simple and serve a clear purpose.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable class definitions.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Concerns & Justifications:**\n- Since there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, the scores are appropriate.\n- The detailed explanations reinforce that the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n- The code is purely a set of custom exception classes for error handling.\n- No malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, no security risks.\n- The scores assigned are justified and reasonable.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis provided and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed. The code is safe, standard, and serves its purpose without any security concerns.",
