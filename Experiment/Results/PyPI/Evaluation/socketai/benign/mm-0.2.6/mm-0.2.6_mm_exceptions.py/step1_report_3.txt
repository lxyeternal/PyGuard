  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to Salesforce and internal modules",
  "sources": "No external data input or reading operations; class definitions with static documentation",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow involving untrusted input or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely defines exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; purely standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes extending the Exception base class, with docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no function calls, data handling, or external communication. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The classes serve to categorize specific errors for a Salesforce-related application or module, and contain no code that could be exploited or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions used for error handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and poses no security risks.",
