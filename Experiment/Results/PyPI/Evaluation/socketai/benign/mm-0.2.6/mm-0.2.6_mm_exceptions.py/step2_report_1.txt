  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Findings**: The code defines custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings, no external data, no malicious behavior.\n   - **Assessment**: The report correctly identifies that these are standard exception classes with no malicious intent.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Findings**: Similar to Report 1, straightforward class definitions, no external data, no suspicious behavior.\n   - **Assessment**: Correctly identified as benign, standard exception classes.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Well justified, scores are appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Findings**: Same as above, no signs of malicious activity, purely class definitions.\n   - **Assessment**: Accurate.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Appropriate and consistent.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Findings**: Consistent with previous, no malicious indicators.\n   - **Assessment**: Correct.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Justified.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Findings**: Same as previous, standard exception class definitions, no suspicious activity.\n   - **Assessment**: Accurate.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 (correct)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n     - Risk: 0 (correct)\n   - **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The reasoning is sound, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score**: Remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Remain at 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: Remain at 0, no security risks detected.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- Since the code is solely class definitions, there's no need to increase any scores.\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, standard exception class definitions, and the scores are justified.
