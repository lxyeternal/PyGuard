  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to Salesforce operations and application-specific errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings; no external data input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; purely static class definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted input or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings, serving as error categories for Salesforce-related errors and application-specific exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The classes are static, simple, and serve a clear purpose. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code. The reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
