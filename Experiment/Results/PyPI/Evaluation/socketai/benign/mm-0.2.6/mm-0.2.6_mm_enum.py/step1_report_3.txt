{
  "purpose": "Define a function that creates an enumeration class dynamically from keyword arguments.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'enums', which is a dictionary of name-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input 'enums' is used solely to generate a class type; no data flows to external systems or causes side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'enum' that takes keyword arguments and returns a new type called 'Enum' with the provided attributes. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communication, or contain any obfuscated or malicious constructs. The code appears to be a simple utility for creating enumeration classes dynamically, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for creating enums dynamically. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
