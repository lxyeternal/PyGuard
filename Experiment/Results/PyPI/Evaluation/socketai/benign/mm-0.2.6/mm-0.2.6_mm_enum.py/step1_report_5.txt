  "purpose": "Define a function to create simple enumeration types dynamically.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, data leaks, or security-sensitive sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines a function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The function 'enum' takes keyword arguments and returns a new type called 'Enum' with attributes corresponding to the provided key-value pairs. It serves as a utility to create enum-like classes dynamically. There are no external inputs, no execution of untrusted code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious operations. The implementation is simple and conventional for creating enums in Python. Overall, the code is benign and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic utility function for creating enums dynamically. It shows no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security issues.",
