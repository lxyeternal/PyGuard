  "purpose": "Defines a function to create simple enumeration types in Python.",
  "sources": "The function takes a dictionary of name-value pairs as input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary passed directly to 'type' for class creation; no complex data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'enum' that generates a new class named 'Enum' with attributes from the provided dictionary. It leverages Python's 'type' to dynamically create a class. The implementation is straightforward, with no external input handling, no code injection, or malicious patterns. No obfuscated code, no suspicious logic, and no external communication or side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility for creating enumeration classes in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
