  "purpose": "Define a function that creates an enumeration type from provided keyword arguments.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'enums' dictionary parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "Input to 'enums' parameter flows into type creation, which is safe and standard.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility function 'enum' that takes keyword arguments and returns a new type named 'Enum' with those attributes. The implementation uses Python's 'type' function to dynamically create a class with attributes specified by 'enums'. This is a common pattern for creating enum-like classes in Python. The code does not involve any data leaks, external calls, or suspicious behaviors. It neither reads untrusted data nor executes any dynamic code or network operations. The function is straightforward and serves a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for creating simple enum classes. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
