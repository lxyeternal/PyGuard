  "purpose": "Utility function to create an enum-like class with specified attributes.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static code with no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the function simply returns a class type with attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'enum' that uses Python's 'type' to dynamically create a class named 'Enum' with attributes provided via keyword arguments. It is a minimal, standard pattern for creating enums in Python. The code does not involve external data, network activity, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with no security issues or malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there are no malicious behaviors. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is 0, reflecting the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for creating enum-like classes. All reports accurately identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
