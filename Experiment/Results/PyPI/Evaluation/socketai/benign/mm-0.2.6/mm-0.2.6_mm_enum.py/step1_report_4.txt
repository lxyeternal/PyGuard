  "purpose": "Define a function to create an enumeration type with specified named values.",
  "sources": "The function takes a dictionary of enum names and values as input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary is used to dynamically create a new class, no complex data flows or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and simple; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function 'enum' creates a new class named 'Enum' with attributes as specified in the enums dictionary. It uses the 'type' function to generate this class dynamically. There are no external data sources, no output operations, and no external code execution or network activity. The code does not handle sensitive information, nor does it perform any malicious actions. The code is minimal, clear, and serves a typical utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for creating enumeration types; it contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
