  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path to include additional package directories, typically for namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__) call, which imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses it to modify __path__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or security-critical operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and applies extend_path to __path__, then assigns the result back to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard pattern for namespace package support, commonly used in Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically via __import__, then uses extend_path to modify __path__ for namespace package support. This is a common, legitimate pattern. No hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, and no malicious code is evident. The code is minimal, straightforward, and consistent with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package pattern with no malicious intent or security issues.",
