  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a standard pattern for namespace packages, no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends the '__path__' variable for namespace package support. This is a common practice in Python packages that span multiple directories. No untrusted input, no suspicious behavior, and no malicious code are present. The use of '__path__' and '__name__' aligns with standard namespace package patterns. There is no obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risk detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace package extension pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
