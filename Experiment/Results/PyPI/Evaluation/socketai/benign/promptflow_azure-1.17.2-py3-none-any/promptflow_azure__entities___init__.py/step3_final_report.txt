  "purpose": "Support for Python namespace packages by extending __path__ to include additional directories.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' and extension of __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or data processing points.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> extend __path__ with __name__ -> assign to __path__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a standard pattern for namespace packages, straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically via __import__ and extends __path__ for namespace package support. It involves no untrusted input, external communication, or malicious logic. The pattern is widely used and recognized as safe. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not process user input or perform risky operations, and the dynamic import is standard in this context. Overall, the code is a typical, safe implementation for namespace packages, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
