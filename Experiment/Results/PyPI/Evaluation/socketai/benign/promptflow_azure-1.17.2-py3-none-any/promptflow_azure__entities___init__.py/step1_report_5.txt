  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ for namespace package support using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports 'pkgutil' to extend __path__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or perform actions based on untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil', then calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__, updating __path__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package support; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path to support namespace packages, which is a common pattern in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. It does not read untrusted input, nor does it perform any network or file operations. The code is straightforward and typical for package namespace handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for namespace package support with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
