{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ for package resource discovery using pkgutil",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and imports pkgutil to extend it",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no sinks for data leakage or execution",
  "flows": "The code assigns a new value to __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard library 'pkgutil' and uses its extend_path method to modify the __path__ variable. This is a common pattern for namespace packages in Python to support multiple directories. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leakage. The code is minimal and adheres to typical package initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for namespace package support, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
