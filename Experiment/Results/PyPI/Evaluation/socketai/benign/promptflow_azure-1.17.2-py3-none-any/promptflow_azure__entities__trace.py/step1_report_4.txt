{
  "purpose": "Define a data class for Cosmos metadata and provide methods to create instances from REST objects and check status.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, especially TraceCosmosMetaDto which is used to construct CosmosMetadata instances.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily processes data within class methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from TraceCosmosMetaDto object to CosmosMetadata via the _from_rest_object method, then to is_disabled and is_ready methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for managing Cosmos metadata, with static method to create an instance from a REST DTO object and methods to check if the Cosmos configuration is disabled or initialized. It primarily handles data encapsulation and status checking without any external or untrusted input handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The imports are standard, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, well-structured data container with status checking methods. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
