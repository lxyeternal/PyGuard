{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure for Cosmos metadata and provide methods to interpret REST API responses related to Cosmos configuration and status.",
  "sources": "TraceCosmosMetaDto object passed to _from_rest_object method.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data output; the code primarily reads from an object and returns a new object or boolean.",
  "flows": "Input object (TraceCosmosMetaDto) flows into _from_rest_object to produce CosmosMetadata; metadata methods check configuration and status.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple dataclass for Cosmos metadata, with a static method to create an instance from a REST API DTO. It includes methods to determine if Cosmos is disabled or initialized based on configuration/status constants. There are no suspicious data manipulations, external calls, or embedded secrets. The code is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious implementation for managing Cosmos metadata states. It appears secure and free of malicious intent.",
