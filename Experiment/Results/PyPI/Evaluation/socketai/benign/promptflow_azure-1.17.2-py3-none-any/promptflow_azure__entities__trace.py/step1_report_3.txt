  "purpose": "Define a data class for Cosmos metadata and provide methods to create instances from REST objects and check statuses.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and constants, static method _from_rest_object, class attributes configuration and status.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of CosmosMetadata from a TraceCosmosMetaDto object; method calls check configuration and status attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data class with a static method for constructing instances from a REST DTO object, and methods to check if the configuration is disabled or ready. It imports constants and models that are presumably defined elsewhere. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be part of a larger, standard application flow for managing Cosmos metadata status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a data container with status-checking methods. No malicious or security-related issues are detected based on this fragment.",
