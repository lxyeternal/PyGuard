{
  "purpose": "Encapsulates Cosmos metadata configuration and status, providing methods to interpret its state based on external constants.",
  "sources": "Data extracted from external DTO object 'TraceCosmosMetaDto' via the static method '_from_rest_object'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely processes and interprets data within the application.",
  "flows": "Source: DTO object -> Static method '_from_rest_object' -> CosmosMetadata instance -> Methods 'is_disabled' and 'is_ready' interpret status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; straightforward data class with simple logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with two string attributes, converting an external DTO into this class and providing status interpretation methods. It does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. The external modules are assumed safe. No malicious or insecure practices are present. The logic is correct and simple, with no anomalies or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data container for Cosmos metadata, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
