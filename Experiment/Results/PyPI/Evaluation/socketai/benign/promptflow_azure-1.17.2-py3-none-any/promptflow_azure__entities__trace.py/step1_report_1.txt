  "purpose": "Define a data structure for Cosmos metadata and methods to interpret its state based on external DTO",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: promptflow.azure._constants._trace and promptflow.azure._restclient.flow.models",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions present",
  "flows": "Data flows from TraceCosmosMetaDto object to CosmosMetadata via the _from_rest_object method",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass 'CosmosMetadata' with attributes 'configuration' and 'status'. It includes a static method '_from_rest_object' that creates an instance from a 'TraceCosmosMetaDto' object, suggesting data is sourced from an external DTO, likely from an API response. Methods 'is_disabled' and 'is_ready' interpret the state based on imported constants. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, intended for status interpretation, with no external data sinks or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data structure for managing Cosmos metadata, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
