  "purpose": "This code manages flow configurations, including loading YAML files, resolving environment variables, validating signatures, and preparing code for deployment within a flow management system.",
  "sources": "File reads (YAML files, requirements.txt, environment files), environment variables, flow directory paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Source data (YAML, environment files, code directories) flows into internal configuration structures, validation routines, and code packaging utilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic execution, or network connections detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks such as loading YAML files, resolving environment dependencies, validating flow signatures, and packaging code. It includes validation steps to prevent invalid signatures and manages environment setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data theft, or network communications. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and relies on standard libraries and practices. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical flow configuration and environment management utility with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It operates solely on local files, performs validation, and prepares code for deployment without executing untrusted code or establishing network connections. The malware and obfuscation scores are set to 0, and the overall security risk is low, with a score of 0.2 reflecting minimal configuration-related concerns.",
