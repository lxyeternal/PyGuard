{
  "purpose": "Initialize a namespace package and expose the PFClient class for external use.",
  "sources": "Import of pkgutil via __import__, reading __path__, importing PFClient from local module _pf_client.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "The code extends __path__ for namespace support and exposes PFClient; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkgutil') instead of direct import is slightly unusual but known; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard namespace package setup, using pkgutil.extend_path to support namespace behavior, and exposing a class PFClient. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The use of __import__ is a known pattern but not suspicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization code with no signs of malware or security issues. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
