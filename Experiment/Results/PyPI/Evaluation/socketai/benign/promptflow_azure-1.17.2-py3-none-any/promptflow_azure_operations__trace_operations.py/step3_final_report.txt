{
  "purpose": "Wrapper around Azure Cosmos DB trace management APIs, facilitating initialization, token retrieval, setup, and metadata fetching within a specified operation scope.",
  "sources": "API responses from init_workspace_cosmos, get_cosmos_resource_token, get_workspace_cosmos_metadata, and input parameters such as container_name and resource_type.",
  "sinks": "Return values from API calls, such as response dictionaries and tokens; no untrusted data is processed or stored.",
  "flows": "API responses flow from service caller methods to internal methods and return to callers; parameters flow into API requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated API 'init_workspace_cosmos' noted; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Azure SDK calls for Cosmos DB management, with telemetry and logging. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscation. The only operational concern is the deprecated API usage, which does not pose a security threat. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting the deprecated API usage, which is operational rather than security-related. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security posture is sound.",
