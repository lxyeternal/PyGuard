  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting the deprecated API usage, which is operational rather than security-related. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security posture is sound."
