  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a wrapper around Azure Cosmos DB management APIs, involving initializing, token retrieval, setup, and metadata fetching.\n- All reports agree that the code does not process untrusted input directly, nor does it execute dynamic or obfuscated code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The only notable concern is the use of a deprecated API, which is an operational issue, not a security threat.\n- The data flows are primarily from parameters and API responses, with no evidence of malicious data handling or exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code:\n- The code appears clean; no malicious logic, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The use of a deprecated API (`init_workspace_cosmos`) is noted but not malicious.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities like injection, data leakage, or backdoors.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only operational flaw is the use of a deprecated API, which could impact future functionality or maintenance but not security.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate. The code is a standard API wrapper with no malicious or insecure patterns.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- Both are correctly assigned as 0, indicating no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the detailed reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal operational risk due to deprecated API, but no security threat.\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- Consider updating the deprecated API to ensure future compatibility and security.\n- No further security issues are identified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured wrapper around Azure Cosmos DB management APIs with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1",
