      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK client for Azure Promptflow resource management. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk and malware scores are justified based on its functionality and external SDK reliance."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only minor concern is the lack of input validation before passing 'source' to 'Path', which is a common pattern but should be validated in production environments. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe."

It operates solely on local files, performs validation, and prepares code for deployment without executing untrusted code or establishing network connections. The malware and obfuscation scores are set to 0, and the overall security risk is low, with a score of 0.2 reflecting minimal configuration-related concerns."

The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting the deprecated API usage, which is operational rather than security-related. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security posture is sound."
