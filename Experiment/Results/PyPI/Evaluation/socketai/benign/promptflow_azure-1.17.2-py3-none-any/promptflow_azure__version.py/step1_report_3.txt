{
  "purpose": "This code retrieves the version number of the 'promptflow-azure' package and assigns it to a variable.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(\"promptflow-azure\")",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__ and VERSION variables",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() -> Sink: __version__ and VERSION variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad exception clause (BaseException) which can mask various errors; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to get the version of the 'promptflow-azure' package using importlib.metadata.version(). If an exception occurs, it defaults to '0.0.1.dev0'. The exception handling is broad but not malicious. No external input, suspicious behavior, or malicious actions are evident. The code is straightforward, focusing on retrieving package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for obtaining package version information with a fallback, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
