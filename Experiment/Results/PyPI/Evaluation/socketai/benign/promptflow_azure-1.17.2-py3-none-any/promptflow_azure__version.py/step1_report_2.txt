  "purpose": "Set the version of the package by retrieving it from the package metadata or defaulting to a development version.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() call to obtain package version; hardcoded fallback string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Retrieving version info from package metadata (source) and assigning to __version__ (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except block to handle potential errors in fetching version info; no suspicious code or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to programmatically determine the package version using importlib.metadata. If the package 'promptflow-azure' is installed, its version is fetched; otherwise, a default development version string is assigned. The try-except block catches all exceptions, which is typical for robust version retrieval. No external data flows, no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version management snippet commonly found in Python packages. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code is benign and serves a typical purpose.",
