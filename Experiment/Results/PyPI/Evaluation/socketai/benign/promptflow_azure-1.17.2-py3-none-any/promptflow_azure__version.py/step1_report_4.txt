  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package 'promptflow-azure' by retrieving it from installed package metadata, with a fallback default version.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(\"promptflow-azure\")",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink; no data leak or harmful effect present",
  "flows": "Attempt to read package version from installed metadata, fallback to default version",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception handling to assign default version; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to obtain the version of the 'promptflow-azure' package. It attempts to read the version dynamically; if this fails, it assigns a default string. This is a standard pattern for version management. No untrusted input sources, no malicious code, no obfuscated or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a benign purpose of version assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple version retrieval with a fallback. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, safe pattern used in package metadata handling.",
