  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'promptflow-azure' package using importlib.metadata.version(), with a fallback to '0.0.1.dev0' if an exception occurs.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() call, which reads package metadata",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() -> Exception handling fallback -> __version__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except BaseException:' clause, which can mask unexpected errors but does not indicate malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version retrieval snippet with a fallback. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but common in such patterns. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The scores across reports are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the broad exception clause, which does not pose a security risk. The current malware score of 0 and risk score of 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
