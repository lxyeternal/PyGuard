{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and set the version of the 'promptflow-azure' package, with a fallback default version.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() for 'promptflow-azure'",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "Source (importlib.metadata.version) → assignment to __version__",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad exception clause (BaseException), which can hide unexpected errors; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain the version of the 'promptflow-azure' package using importlib.metadata. If an exception occurs (any exception, including SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt, etc.), it defaults __version__ to '0.0.1.dev0'. The code includes a copyright notice and straightforward version assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious activities. The broad exception handling could mask other issues but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely aims to retrieve package version information with a fallback default. No malicious or security concerns are evident.",
