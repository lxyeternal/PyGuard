  "purpose": "Set a user agent string for SDK identification by importing version info and formatting it into a static string.",
  "sources": "Import of VERSION from promptflow.azure._version",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignment without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and string formatting",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from an internal module and constructs a user agent string using string formatting. It contains no external inputs, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code. The purpose is standard SDK setup. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, justified by the code's simplicity and clarity. Confidence in benignity is high, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for setting a user agent string in an SDK. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
