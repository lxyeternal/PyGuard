  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   All reports describe a straightforward import of a version string from an internal module (`promptflow.azure._version`) and the construction of a `USER_AGENT` string. The original code snippet confirms this:\n   ```python\n   from promptflow.azure._version import VERSION\n\n   USER_AGENT = \"{}/{}\".format(\"promptflow-azure-sdk\", VERSION)\n   ```\n   There are no signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard practice for SDK identification.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment:\n   - They correctly identify the purpose as setting a user agent string.\n   - They note the source of `VERSION` and the construction of `USER_AGENT`.\n   - They recognize the absence of anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent.\n   \n   No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n   \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since the code is benign, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a minimal, standard SDK setup snippet.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is purely for setting a user agent string, a common practice.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriately scored.**",
