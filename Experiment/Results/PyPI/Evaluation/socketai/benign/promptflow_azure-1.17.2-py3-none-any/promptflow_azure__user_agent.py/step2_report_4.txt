  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: importing a version string from an internal module and constructing a user agent string.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic or untrusted input, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign and standard practice for SDK identification.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None. The code is simple and correct.\n- **Security flaws:** None. No secrets, no data leaks, no suspicious logic.\n- **Other mistakes:** None identified.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The malware score is 0 because there is no malicious activity, no suspicious code, and no external data or network activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk score is 0, aligning with the above.\n\n### Potential claims or assumptions:\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus solely on the code's apparent purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, there is no need to increase any scores.\n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard SDK setup snippet for setting a user agent string.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current analysis and the evidence provided.",
