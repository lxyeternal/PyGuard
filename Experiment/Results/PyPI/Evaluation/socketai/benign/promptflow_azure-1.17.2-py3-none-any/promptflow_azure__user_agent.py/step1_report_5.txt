  "purpose": "Set a user agent string for HTTP requests or logging purposes within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from promptflow.azure._version import VERSION' and the string formatting assignment to USER_AGENT.",
  "sinks": "The USER_AGENT string may be used in network requests, logs, or other output, but no untrusted data is directly used here.",
  "flows": "The imported VERSION value is used in the string formatting to assign to USER_AGENT, which could be used downstream in network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, importing a version and constructing a user agent string.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version number from a local module, then formats a user agent string with static and dynamic parts. No input/output handling or untrusted data sources are present. No suspicious or malicious code is evident; the purpose appears to be setting a user agent header for HTTP requests or logs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to define a user agent string for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
