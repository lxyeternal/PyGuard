  "purpose": "Define a USER_AGENT string using a package version for identifying the client in network requests.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from promptflow.azure._version import VERSION",
  "sinks": "None; the code only assigns a string to a variable and does not perform any data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string assignment. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a specific module and constructs a user-agent string. There are no input sources that could carry untrusted data, nor are there sinks or flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. It appears to be a standard configuration snippet. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply constructs a user-agent string for network identification, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
