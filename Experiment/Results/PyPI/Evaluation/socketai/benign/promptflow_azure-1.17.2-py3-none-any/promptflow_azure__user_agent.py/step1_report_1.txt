  "purpose": "Define a user agent string for an Azure SDK component using version info.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported VERSION variable from promptflow.azure._version.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs a string with the imported VERSION and assigns it to USER_AGENT.",
  "flows": "The imported VERSION flows into the USER_AGENT string construction, but no further data flow or external output occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from an internal module and constructs a user agent string. There are no external data inputs or network connections. It appears to be standard practice for SDK identification purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign construction of a user agent string with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
