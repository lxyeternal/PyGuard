{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for Azure flow connection configurations and workspace connection specifications, with methods for conversion from REST objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules, class methods '_from_rest_object' that take REST data objects as input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects; no code execution or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "REST objects -> class instances via '_from_rest_object' methods, then to dictionaries via '_to_dict' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. The code primarily handles data structure conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes with methods to convert from REST models to internal representations and vice versa. No input validation, external calls, or sensitive data handling is present. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is observed. The code appears standard for data serialization/deserialization tasks in SDKs or APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model for Azure connection configurations with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply facilitates data conversion between REST models and internal data structures.",
