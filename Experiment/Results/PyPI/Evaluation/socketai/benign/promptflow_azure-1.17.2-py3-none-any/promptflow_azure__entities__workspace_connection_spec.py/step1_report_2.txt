{
  "purpose": "Define data classes for connection configuration and workspace connection specifications, including conversion from REST objects and to dictionary format.",
  "sources": "RestConnectionConfigSpec and RestWorkspaceConnectionSpec imported from external modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "REST objects are converted into class instances via _from_rest_object methods; class instances can be serialized to dicts via _to_dict methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes with standard methods for initialization from REST objects and serialization to dictionaries. No data is processed from user input or external sources within this code snippet. The imported modules are from external SDKs, and their content isn't analyzed here, but their usage appears standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. The classes are purely data containers with straightforward conversion methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data classes for configuration specifications, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve as part of a larger system for handling connection configurations safely.",
