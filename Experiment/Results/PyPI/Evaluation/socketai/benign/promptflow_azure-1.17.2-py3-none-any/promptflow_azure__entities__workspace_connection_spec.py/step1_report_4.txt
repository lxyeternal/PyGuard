{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes for handling connection specifications and configurations, with methods to convert to and from REST API models.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: promptflow.azure._restclient.flow.models, and input parameters to class methods (rest_obj).",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in a potentially dangerous way; no data output to external systems or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "REST object inputs are converted into class instances via _from_rest_object methods, and class instances are converted to dicts via _to_dict methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward data structure definitions and conversions without unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports models and defines dataclasses for connection configurations, with standard methods for serialization and deserialization. There are no network operations, no handling of untrusted user input, no evaluation of environment variables, and no execution of code from untrusted sources. The functions are static converters, typical for SDKs or client libraries. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of data models with no malicious intent. It primarily facilitates data handling and serialization, with no evidence of security risks or malware.",
