  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard client class for managing Promptflow resources.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. Uses external SDKs appropriately.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score aligns with the lack of suspicious activity. The malware score is justified as 0, given no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar management client with focus on resource handling.\n- **Findings:** No backdoors, code injection, or obfuscation. Uses SDKs properly.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No malicious activity or obfuscation found. The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Client class for Azure ML Promptflow resource management.\n- **Findings:** Handles untrusted input parameters but relies on SDKs designed for such data. No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score reflects that inputs are passed to SDKs, which is standard. No malware or obfuscation detected. The reasoning is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar resource management client.\n- **Findings:** Validates parameters, no malicious code, no obfuscation, standard SDK usage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No signs of malicious activity. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Management client for Azure Promptflow.\n- **Findings:** Uses standard SDKs, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting standard resource management code with minimal security concerns.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation techniques observed.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, as the code interacts with external SDKs and resources in a standard manner, with no apparent vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured SDK client for Azure Promptflow resource management. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk patterns are present. The low risk and malware scores are justified.",
