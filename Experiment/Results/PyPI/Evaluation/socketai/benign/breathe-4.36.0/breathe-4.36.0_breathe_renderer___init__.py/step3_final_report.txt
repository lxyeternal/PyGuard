  "purpose": "Provides functions for formatting XML parser errors with optional Unicode warnings and manages rendering contexts with masking capabilities.",
  "sources": "Error message parameters, unicode warning flag, node stack, mask factory, directive arguments, domain, child flag",
  "sinks": "Nodes warning and paragraph creation, report warnings, context creation with masked data",
  "flows": "Error parameters and unicode flag influence warning nodes and report warnings; create_child_context copies node stack and applies mask",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward error formatting and context management functions/classes. No external network or file I/O beyond warnings. Uses standard libraries. No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. Malware score is 0, risk is very low (~0.1), confidence high (~0.9). The code's purpose is benign, related to documentation error handling and context stacking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scoring is appropriate; malware and obfuscation are correctly set to zero, and risk is minimal. No adjustments needed.",
