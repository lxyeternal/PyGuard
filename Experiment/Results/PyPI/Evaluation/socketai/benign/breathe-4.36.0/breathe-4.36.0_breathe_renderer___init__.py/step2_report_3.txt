  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward functions and a class for error reporting and context management.\n- They use standard libraries (`textwrap`, `docutils.nodes`) and typical design patterns.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls are present.\n- The logic revolves around formatting warnings, handling unicode issues, and managing a node stack with masking, which are common in documentation systems.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, focused on error reporting and context management, with high confidence (0.9). No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the benign nature. The malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign utility functions for error handling and context management. Confidence is 1, indicating certainty.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's benign purpose. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Again, describes standard error reporting and context management. Confidence is 0.9, malware score is 0.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar benign utility functions, standard error formatting, context management, no malicious signs. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still low, justified by the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, straightforward functions, high confidence (0.95), no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, with scores at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but all low, reflecting the minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — a very low security risk, mainly because of error handling and context management, which are typical and benign.\n\n**In summary,** the reports are consistent and accurate. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code, and no adjustments are necessary.",
