  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured build configuration script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The subprocess calls and environment variable usage are standard and controlled. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to subprocess execution, which is typical in such scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, consistent with the reports. No further action is necessary."
