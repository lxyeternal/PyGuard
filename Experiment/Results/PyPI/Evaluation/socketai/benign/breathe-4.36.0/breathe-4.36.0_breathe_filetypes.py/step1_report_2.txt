{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions to determine syntax highlighting information based on filename, primarily for use with the Pygments library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filename input provided to the functions get_pygments_alias and get_extension.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not perform any data output, network communication, or write operations. They return data based on filename analysis only.",
  "flows": "Input filename → get_lexer_for_filename (via Pygments) → retrieval of aliases; filename parsing → extension extraction and modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard library functions and Pygments API without unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one to get a Pygments lexer alias for a filename, and another to extract and process the file extension. It includes try-except handling for missing lexers, which is standard. No external network access, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The usage of Pygments API appears legitimate and straightforward. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filename analysis and syntax highlighting purposes. No malicious activity or security risks are detected based on this code fragment.",
