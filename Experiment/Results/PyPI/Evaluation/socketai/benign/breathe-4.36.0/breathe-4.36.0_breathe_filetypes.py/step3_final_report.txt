  "purpose": "Utility functions to determine the syntax highlighting lexer alias and extract file extensions based on filename input.",
  "sources": "Filename input provided to get_pygments_alias and get_extension functions",
  "sinks": "None; functions do not write data or perform external operations",
  "flows": "Input filename -> get_lexer_for_filename or os.path.splitext -> output alias or extension",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward string handling and library calls",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions and the Pygments library to map filenames to lexer aliases and extract extensions. Error handling for missing lexers is appropriate. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The reliance on filename input is inherent to its purpose and does not introduce security risks. The code is simple, well-structured, and performs only benign operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filename-based syntax highlighting, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by the reliance on filename input, but overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
