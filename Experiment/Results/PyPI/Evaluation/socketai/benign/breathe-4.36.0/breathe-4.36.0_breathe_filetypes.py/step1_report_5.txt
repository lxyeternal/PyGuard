  "purpose": "Utility functions to determine code language syntax highlighting based on filename extension using pygments.",
  "sources": "Input filename parameters in get_pygments_alias() and get_extension().",
  "sinks": "Return statements in both functions, mainly returning derived strings based on filename input.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> get_pygments_alias()/get_extension() -> return derived alias or extension.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple filename parsing and uses the pygments library to identify language aliases for syntax highlighting. The get_pygments_alias() function retrieves the first alias of a lexer for the filename, while get_extension() extracts and processes the file extension, including a special case for 'unparsed' extensions. There are no external network calls, no handling of untrusted data beyond filename parsing, and no suspicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for syntax highlighting purposes. No malicious intent or malicious code structures are present. The only potential concern is reliance on filename input, but this is appropriate for the function's purpose and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
