{
  "purpose": "The module provides utility functions to determine the syntax highlighting lexer alias and file extension based on filename, primarily for use with Pygments.",
  "sources": "Filename input parameters in functions get_pygments_alias and get_extension",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not write or execute untrusted data or perform harmful operations",
  "flows": "Input filename -> get_lexer_for_filename (source) -> alias extraction (sink); Input filename -> os.path.splitext (source) -> return extension (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior present. The handling of 'unparsed' extension is documented and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, uses Pygments to get lexer info based on filename, and processes file extensions. Error handling for missing lexer is appropriately done. The extension processing correctly interprets special '.unparsed' extension. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code appears well-structured and purpose-specific without suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for filename-based syntax highlighting without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or dangerous operations.",
