{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to determine syntax highlighting based on filename extensions, specifically for use with Pygments.",
  "sources": "Input comes from the 'filename' parameter in both functions, which is user-controlled or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful actions; the code only processes filenames to derive highlighting aliases or extensions.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> get_lexer_for_filename (retrieves lexer) -> returns alias; Input filename -> os.path.splitext -> returns extension string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. Comment mentions 'unparsed' extension handling but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and pygments for syntax highlighting purposes. It safely handles filenames, extracts extensions, and maps filenames to lexer aliases. Error handling for 'ClassNotFound' is appropriate. The replacement of 'unparsed' with 'text' is a straightforward string manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for syntax highlighting purposes. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, and there are no security risks evident. The code operates safely with proper error handling and input validation.",
