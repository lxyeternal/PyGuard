  "flows": "No data flow; only class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple class definition with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports the __future__ annotations feature and defines a custom exception class BreatheError. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard, harmless class declaration intended for error handling within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is unlikely to be malicious or maliciously intended.",
