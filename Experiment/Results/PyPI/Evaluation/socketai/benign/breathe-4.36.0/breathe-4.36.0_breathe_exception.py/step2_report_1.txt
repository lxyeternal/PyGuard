  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code snippet itself is benign, importing only a __future__ feature for compatibility and defining a class inheriting from Exception.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; no logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary unless future context suggests otherwise.\n\n4. **Justification for Malware and Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no malicious logic, malware score should remain 0.\n   - Security risk is also minimal, given the absence of vulnerabilities or external data handling, so 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly assume the code is benign based on the provided snippet.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are necessary or supported.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware and security risk, full confidence in benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a minimal, harmless class definition for a custom exception, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No further action is needed unless additional context or code snippets suggest otherwise.",
