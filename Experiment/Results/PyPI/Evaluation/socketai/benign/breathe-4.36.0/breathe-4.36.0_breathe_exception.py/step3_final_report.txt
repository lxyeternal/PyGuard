  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class BreatheError inheriting from Exception.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports __future__.annotations for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class definition does not involve data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition with standard import.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations and defines a simple exception class BreatheError. It contains no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The code is minimal, clear, and benign. All signals indicate no security risks or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
