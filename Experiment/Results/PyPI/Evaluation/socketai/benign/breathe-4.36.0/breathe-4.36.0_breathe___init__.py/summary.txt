  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Sphinx extension setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' scores are appropriate, though the slight elevation of the security risk score to 0.1 is unnecessary. The overall assessment is that the code is safe and should be assigned malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0."
