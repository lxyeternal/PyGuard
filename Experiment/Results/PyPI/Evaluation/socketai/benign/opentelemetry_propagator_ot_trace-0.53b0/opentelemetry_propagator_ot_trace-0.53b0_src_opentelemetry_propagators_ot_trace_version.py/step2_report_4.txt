  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a header with licensing comments and a version string assignment.\n   - There are no executable functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic content.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no security risks.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments conclude zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n   - The code contains no malicious payload or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are factual and based on the code snippet.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code snippet is a standard license header and version declaration.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The assessments are accurate and well-justified.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are correct. The code is benign, and no security concerns are warranted.",
