{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set the version information for a software package, likely related to OpenTelemetry.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The source (__version__ variable assignment) does not connect to any sinks or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard license header and version assignment with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a license header followed by a version string assignment. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The license header is standard and does not introduce any security risks. The version string is a static value, and there are no code paths or external data flows that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign license header and version declaration. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.",
