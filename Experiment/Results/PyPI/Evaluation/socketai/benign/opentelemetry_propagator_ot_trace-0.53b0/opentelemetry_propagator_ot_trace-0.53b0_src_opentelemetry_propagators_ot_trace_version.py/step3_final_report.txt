  "purpose": "License header and version declaration for the open-source package",
  "sources": "Comments containing license information and the assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment and comments only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a static version string assignment. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is a typical header for an open-source project, with no indicators of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
