  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-focused, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The low security risk score (0.1) assigned in the reports is justified by the external file read, which is standard practice. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0. The overall assessment indicates no security concerns."
