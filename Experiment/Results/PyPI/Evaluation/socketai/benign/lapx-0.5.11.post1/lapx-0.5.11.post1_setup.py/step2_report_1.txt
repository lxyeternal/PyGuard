  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the script as a standard setup process for a Python package involving Cython and C++ extensions. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty)\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as a typical build script. The operations (reading version info, compiling Cython, copying files) are standard. No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators are present. The confidence level is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also views the script as a build setup, noting subprocess calls for compilation and file copying. Slight concern about subprocess execution but considers it standard in build processes. No malicious code detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 (high)\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low)\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe cautious note about subprocess calls is reasonable, but given the context (standard build), it's not inherently risky. The overall conclusion aligns with the code's purpose. The security risk score is appropriately low, considering the benign nature of the operations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizes the standard nature of the setup, with no signs of malicious behavior. Recognizes subprocess calls for Cython compilation as routine.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code, the report rightly interprets the subprocess calls as part of normal extension compilation. No suspicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also concludes the script is a legitimate setup routine, with no malicious intent. Recognizes file copying and subprocess calls as typical.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate assessment; the operations are standard, and no malicious indicators are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard build script, no malicious activity. Emphasizes that subprocess calls are typical and do not execute untrusted code at runtime.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate interpretation; the code is a typical setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n  None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The subprocess calls are used solely for compiling Cython sources, which is standard practice.\n\n- **Obfuscation:**  \n  No obfuscated code or hidden payloads are present. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Scores:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with their analysis. The security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting the routine nature of build scripts.\n\n- **Flow & Logic:**  \n  The logic flow—reading version info, compiling sources, copying files—is typical for such setup scripts.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:**  \n  The only minor concern could be the use of subprocess calls, but in this context, they are standard and controlled, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** (low, due to subprocess calls but justified as part of normal build process)\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a legitimate setup script for a scientific Python package, involving standard operations such as reading metadata, compiling Cython extensions, and copying build artifacts. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with all provided reports and the code analysis.",
