  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and if any scores need adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script, reading version info, README, copying files, compiling Cython extensions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess to call 'cython' — typical for building extensions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All operations are standard for a build script. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with emphasis on subprocess call for 'cython' and copying files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess execution is typical, but the report notes potential risk if source files are malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, but acknowledges that subprocess calls could be risky if files are compromised.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes the standard nature but notes that subprocess calls can be risky if source files are malicious. However, in this context, the source files are part of the package, so this is normal.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable, given the potential risk of malicious source files.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is balanced and reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build process, involving Cython compilation, copying binaries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard subprocess call, copying shared objects.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets; standard build operations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup involving reading files, compiling extensions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for 'cython', copying files, installing dependencies.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical build script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup, with standard compilation steps.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess call for 'cython', copying files.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate build process, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard build and setup script for a Python package involving Cython and C++ extensions.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The subprocess calls to 'cython' are typical for such build scripts.\n- The minor security risk scores (0.2) reflect the potential risk if source files are malicious, but in the context of the build script, this is acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (standard build process carries minimal risk, but some caution is always warranted if source files are compromised)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is a legitimate, standard build script with no malicious intent.",
