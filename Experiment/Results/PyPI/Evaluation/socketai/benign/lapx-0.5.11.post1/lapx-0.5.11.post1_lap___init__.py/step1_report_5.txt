{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for a linear assignment problem solver using the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm, importing functions from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and constants from internal modules '_lapjv' and 'lapmod'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the module mainly exposes functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The version string is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module interface exposing functions from internal modules. It imports specific functions and constants, and defines an __all__ list for exports. There are no runtime data processing, no input/output handling, and no dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and conforms to typical Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It appears to be a standard, safe module interface for LAP solvers. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
