{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an interface for a linear assignment problem solver, exposing functions and constants from internal modules (_lapjv and lapmod) for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports functions and constants from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data outputs, network communication, or external data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions/constants from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow beyond module initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module (__init__.py style) that imports functions and constants from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no logic, data processing, or external communication. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The internal modules (_lapjv and lapmod) are not provided, but their interface usage appears benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature. Given the absence of suspicious activity or vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface module for a linear assignment problem solver, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
