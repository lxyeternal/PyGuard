{
  "purpose": "To provide a Python interface for solving linear assignment problems using different algorithms.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_lapjv and lapmod).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code mainly imports functions and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports functions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and constants from internal modules (_lapjv and lapmod) and defines the __all__ list for export. It only involves module metadata (__version__) and standard import/export statements, which are typical for a Python package's initialization file. There are no input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling mechanisms. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign package setup for exposing functions related to solving the linear assignment problem.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily imports functions from internal modules and exposes them for external use. No malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious code is detected.",
