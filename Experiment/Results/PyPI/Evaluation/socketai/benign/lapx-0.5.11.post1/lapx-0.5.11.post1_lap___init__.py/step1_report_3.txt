{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python interface for solving linear assignment problems using the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm, including functions for dense and sparse matrices.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and constants from internal modules _lapjv and lapmod.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code mainly imports and exposes functions for use in other parts of a program.",
  "flows": "Imported functions are assigned to the module's namespace for external use; no data flows or untrusted input handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The version string is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific functions and constants from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no user input handling, network activity, file operations, or other typical indicators of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward package __init__.py file, setting up a module interface. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer that exposes functions for solving assignment problems. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for its purpose.",
