{
  "purpose": "This source code provides an interface for a linear assignment problem solver using the LAPJV and LAPMOD algorithms, facilitating optimal assignment computations.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and constants from internal modules (_lapjv and lapmod), which are likely part of the same package, and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not perform any data output, network activity, or data manipulation that could lead to leaks.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing internal modules and symbols, then exposing these symbols through the __all__ list for external use; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns; the code appears to be a straightforward module interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module version, imports specific functions and constants from internal submodules, and exposes them via the __all__ list for external access. It serves as an interface or API layer for the LAP solver package. There are no signs of external data reading, data processing, or malicious code. The module does not perform any computations or contain logic beyond imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python module interface for a LAP solver library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated elements. The structure is typical for Python packages exposing internal functionalities. No security concerns are evident based on this code snippet.",
