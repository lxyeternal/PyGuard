  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described issues with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as minimal, utility-like, with no explicit malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code snippets are either minimal or not provided, limiting definitive static analysis.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious external references are mentioned.\n- The confidence levels are generally high (0.6 to 0.9), reflecting the limited context but overall benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Utility script for data processing; no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected; high confidence (0.9).  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Data processing, possibly interacting with external resources.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity; the analysis is cautious but finds no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Basic utility, minimal code context.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The minimal nature and lack of suspicious patterns support a benign view.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Data processing with no explicit network or file I/O.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The low confidence (0.6) is appropriate given limited code context; no issues detected.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Data processing and network communication, but no explicit code shown.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** The cautious approach is justified; no suspicious activity found.  \n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Uniformly low at 0.2, reflecting minimal concern based on static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Given the lack of code and suspicious indicators, **all scores are reasonable**.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, considering the limited code context.\n- No adjustments are necessary unless runtime behaviors or more code details reveal otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The static analysis and the provided summaries do not suggest any malicious or obfuscated activity.\n- The scores are conservative and aligned with the evidence.\n- The risk scores could remain at 0.2 unless dynamic analysis indicates otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**All scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.**",
