{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing and network communication, potentially for collecting or transmitting data.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from user inputs, environment variables, or external files/read operations (though none are explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, external server connections, or data transmission functions are potential sinks if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly towards network or storage operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation detected; code structure appears standard. Absence of explicit network or file operations limits suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates standard Python syntax and library usage. No obvious malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage routines, is present. Lack of network or I/O operations reduces concern. No signs of code obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. Since the code is minimal or not provided explicitly, confidence in this analysis is moderate, pending more details.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The code appears benign, but limited context prevents definitive assessment. No malware indicators or security threats are detected.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
