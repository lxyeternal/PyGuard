  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and context.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file I/O, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through data processing functions, network calls, or environment variable usage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Static review indicates no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. Malware score is 0, consistent across all reports. Risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern given the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are high (0.6-0.9), appropriate for limited code context. No suspicious external references or behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action required unless dynamic or runtime analysis reveals issues.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
