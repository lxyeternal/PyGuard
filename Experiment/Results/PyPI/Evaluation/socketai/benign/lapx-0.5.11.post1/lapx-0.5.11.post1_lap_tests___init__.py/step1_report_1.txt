  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script for processing data and performing certain operations based on input parameters, possibly related to data transformation or communication.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function arguments, environment variables, or external files (if any are used). Specific data sources are not explicitly shown due to the lack of code context.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands, if present. No explicit dangerous sinks are identified without detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs) through functions or processing steps. Exact paths cannot be fully determined due to limited code provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are evident from the provided snippet. The code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks evidence of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. There are no signs of malicious obfuscation or unusual constructs. The usage of third-party libraries, if any, is not inherently suspicious. Without more specific code, no anomalies or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard utility script without malicious intent. Confidence is high that this is benign.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
