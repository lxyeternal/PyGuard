{
  "purpose": "Import statements from NVIDIA's NeMo framework, serving as dependencies for neural network modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'nemo.core.neural_types' and 'nemo.core.classes'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; only static import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static imports without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious constructs; license comments are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and import statements from a reputable open-source library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal nature of the code indicates it is benign, serving as dependency imports for a larger project. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence, given the lack of any suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
