  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is just an import statement; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning correctly identifies the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. These are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior, no code execution, no external data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, only import statements; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, no suspicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only imports and license info.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; benign import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; just imports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no suspicious constructs.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and licensing comments.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- The consistent scores across reports are appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- I agree with the current scores; no changes needed.\n- Based on the evidence, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that. No security risks or malicious activity are present in this fragment.",
