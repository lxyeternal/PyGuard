  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and classes from the NVIDIA NeMo framework for neural network development.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'nemo.core.neural_types' and 'nemo.core.classes'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only contains import statements without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is standard for importing modules.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes import statements for NVIDIA NeMo modules, which are common in machine learning projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The license header indicates legitimate open-source use. No functions, data flows, or network calls are present that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a normal part of a larger, legitimate machine learning project utilizing NVIDIA's NeMo toolkit. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code.",
