  "purpose": "Defines environment variable names used for configuration and debugging within the NVIDIA NEMO framework.",
  "sources": "Static declaration of string constants representing environment variable names.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or untrusted data sources; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow; constants are used as configuration flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares string constants for environment variable names, serving as configuration parameters. There are no input sources, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The variables are standard flags for enabling features or setting paths. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of environment variable name definitions used for configuration within the NVIDIA NEMO framework. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
