  "purpose": "Define environment variable names used for configuration and debugging in the NVIDIA Nemo framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed or referenced by the framework (though not explicitly read in this code fragment).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident; only variable name constants are declared.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward constant declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constants representing environment variable names used in the NVIDIA Nemo framework. There are no input reads, data processing, or data transmission. The comments clarify their intended use for configuration and debugging. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as configuration constants for environment variables. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
