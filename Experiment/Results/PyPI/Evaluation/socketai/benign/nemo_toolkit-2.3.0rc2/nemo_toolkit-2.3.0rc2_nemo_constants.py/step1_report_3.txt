  "purpose": "Define environment variable names related to NVIDIA's NEMO framework configuration and settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable names for configuration purposes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external sources; only variable name definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data input/output identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares constants representing environment variable names used for configuration in the NEMO framework. These are static string assignments with no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external data processing. No hardcoded secrets, no network calls, and no unusual behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of environment variable name definitions intended for configuration purposes within the NVIDIA NEMO framework. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
