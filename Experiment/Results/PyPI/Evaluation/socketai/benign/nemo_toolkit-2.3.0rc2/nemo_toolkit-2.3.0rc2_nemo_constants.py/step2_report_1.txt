  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code only defines string constants representing environment variable names used within the NVIDIA NEMO framework.\n   - There are no input reads, data processing, dynamic code execution, network calls, or any form of data flow.\n   - The variables are intended for configuration and debugging purposes.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious code, such as backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.\n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves as configuration constants.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports concur that the code is benign, merely defining environment variable names.\n   - No report suggests any malicious activity, security risk, or obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. This aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear constant definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0, since no security vulnerabilities or risks are present.\n\n5. **Potential for Changes:**\n   - Given the evidence, the scores are reasonable and should not be adjusted.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is a benign set of constant definitions for environment variable names.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0      | No malicious activity or code detected.                                                         |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      | Clear, straightforward constant definitions; no obfuscation present.                          |\n| Security Risk     | 0      | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or risky behaviors identified.                                |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and intended solely for configuration purposes within the NVIDIA NEMO framework. No further action or concern is warranted.",
