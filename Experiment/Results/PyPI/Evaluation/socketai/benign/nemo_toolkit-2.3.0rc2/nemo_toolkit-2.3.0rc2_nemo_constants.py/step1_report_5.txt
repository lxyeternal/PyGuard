  "purpose": "Define environment variable names for configuration and debugging purposes within the NVIDIA Nemo framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as NEMO_ENABLE_COLORING, NEMO_REDIRECT_LOGS_TO_STDERR, NEMO_TESTING, NEMO_EXPM_VERSION, NEMO_CACHE_DIR, NEMO_DATA_STORE_CACHE_DIR, NEMO_DATA_STORE_CACHE_SHARED.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of these environment variables to control program behavior or configurations, but no direct data leak or malicious effect is evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at runtime to configure application behavior, with no data flows leading to untrusted data influence or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are straightforward configuration flags or paths; no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns string values to named constants representing environment variable names used for configuration purposes. There is no logic, control flow, or data processing. It appears to be standard configuration setup. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of environment variable name definitions for configuration, with no malicious intent or security risks observed.",
