{
  "purpose": "Define environment variable names used for configuration and debugging in NVIDIA's Nemo project",
  "sources": "Environment variables read via their names (e.g., 'NEMO_ENABLE_COLORING', 'NEMO_TESTING')",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted environment variables could influence program behavior, but no direct unsafe actions are performed",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read by their names; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code solely declares constants for environment variable names",
  "analysis": "The code declares string constants representing environment variable names used elsewhere in the project for configuration purposes. No input processing, data manipulation, or external system interactions are present. It does not contain dynamic code execution, data leakage, or security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as configuration references.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines environment variable name constants for configuration and debugging; there are no malicious behaviors or security issues present.",
