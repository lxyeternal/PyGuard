  "purpose": "This code is a license header comment block with no executable code or data processing.",
  "sources": "The comment block itself; no data input or output sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static comments with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only licensing comments, no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely a license header comment with no executable code, data input/output, or logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. There are no sources, sinks, or flows that could lead to vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The code's nature is straightforward, and no assumptions beyond the visible comments are made.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header with no security or malicious concerns. All reports are accurate and appropriately score the risk, malware, and obfuscation as zero. No further action or correction is necessary.",
