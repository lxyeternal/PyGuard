  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing a Python project, including dependency management and code style checking.",
  "sources": "Reads package information from 'nemo/package_info.py'; reads multiple requirements files; reads 'README.md'; processes command-line options for style checks.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that handle untrusted data; no network or system calls with untrusted inputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads package info -> loads dependencies -> performs code style checks -> sets up package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The script follows standard setup procedures without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for Python package distribution, with dependency management, metadata loading, style checking commands, and package configuration. It imports package info dynamically, reads multiple requirements files, and defines a custom style check command. All code segments perform typical setup tasks. There are no indications of malicious behavior, network activity, or data leakage. The structure and functions adhere to common practices, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious or sabotage code. It handles dependencies and style checks securely and transparently.",
