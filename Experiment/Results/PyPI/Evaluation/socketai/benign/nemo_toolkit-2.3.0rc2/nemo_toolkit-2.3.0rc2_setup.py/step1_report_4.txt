  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project, including dependency management and code style checking.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata from 'nemo/package_info.py', reads README.md, reads multiple requirements files, and executes subprocess commands for code style checks.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls for 'isort' and 'black' code format checkers, reading of multiple requirements files.",
  "flows": "Metadata and requirements are loaded from files and modules; subprocess commands are executed for style checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The subprocess commands only invoke external formatting tools. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages setup configurations, dependencies, and code style enforcement. It imports project info dynamically, reads multiple requirements files, and defines a custom command for code style checks. All actions are typical for setup scripts. No obfuscated code or suspicious operations are present. No indications of malicious intent or malware. The subprocess commands are standard for code style tools and do not perform any harmful operations. No external network or data leaks are visible. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It handles dependencies, metadata, and code style checks safely and as expected.",
