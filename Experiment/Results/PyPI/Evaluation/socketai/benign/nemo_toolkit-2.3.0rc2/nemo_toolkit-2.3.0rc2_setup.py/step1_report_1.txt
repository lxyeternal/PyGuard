  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project, managing dependencies and code style checks.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules, reads configuration data from 'package_info.py' and 'README.md', reads multiple requirement files, executes subprocess commands for code style checking.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.call to execute external commands for code style tools (isort, black).",
  "flows": "Import 'package_info' -> assign metadata -> run subprocess commands for code style checkers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; subprocess calls are limited to code style tools; no suspicious network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules to prepare setup parameters. It dynamically loads package info from a separate file and reads multiple requirements files for dependencies. It defines a custom command for style checking that executes 'isort' and 'black' via subprocess. The setup() function configures packaging, metadata, dependencies, and custom commands. No code indicates malicious behavior or data exfiltration. Subprocess executions are limited to code formatting tools, which are benign. Overall, the code appears standard for a setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package, managing dependencies and style checks. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are identified. It functions as intended for project setup and maintenance.",
