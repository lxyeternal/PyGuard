  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details, potential risks, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup.py script that manages dependencies, loads package info dynamically, and runs code style checks via subprocess. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated, possibly due to dynamic import of 'package_info.py', which could be manipulated if the source is compromised, but overall, the code is standard.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable. The dynamic import warrants caution but is common in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard dependency loading and code style checks. No suspicious code or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high confidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the script as standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes the dynamic import of 'package_info' and subprocess calls for style checks. Raises concern that importing 'package_info' from a relative path could be manipulated if the package is compromised.\n- **Potential concern:** If 'nemo/package_info.py' is malicious or tampered, it could execute arbitrary code during import.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code execution, but the potential for malicious behavior exists if the source is compromised.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — this is justified given the reliance on an external, dynamically imported module that could be compromised.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — cautious but not definitive.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The concern about dynamic import is valid, but in normal circumstances, the code remains benign. The score reflects the potential risk, not an active threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing that subprocess calls are limited to code style tools, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no active threats.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity. Emphasizes that subprocess calls are for style checks and dependencies are loaded from files.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk scores:** Most are low, with the third report slightly higher (0.2) due to the dynamic import concern, which is justified.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — a very low risk, primarily due to the dynamic import of 'package_info.py', which could be a vector if the source is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe code appears to be a typical, well-structured setup.py script for a Python package. The only caveat is the dynamic import of 'package_info.py', which should be verified for integrity in a security-sensitive environment. Otherwise, no malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident.",
