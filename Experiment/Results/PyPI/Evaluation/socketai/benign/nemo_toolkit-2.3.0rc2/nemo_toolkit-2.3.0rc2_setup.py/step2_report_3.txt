  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script; imports package info, reads requirements, executes subprocess for code style.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls are limited to 'isort' and 'black'—benign tools.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, subprocess calls are safe.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is typical for a setup.py, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The subprocess commands are for code formatting, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low, due to minimal external dependencies but no real concern).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup script; reads package info, dependencies, README.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling; subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior; standard setup pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, just a typical setup.py.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 (no concern).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; dynamic import of 'package_info' from a relative path.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The dynamic import could be a concern if the 'nemo/package_info.py' is compromised, but in normal circumstances, it's standard.\n- **Anomalies:** The dynamic import warrants caution, but no malicious code is evident.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The main concern is reliance on external package info; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher due to dynamic import, but not malicious).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup; reads package info, dependencies, runs subprocess for style checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup script; safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; reads package info, dependencies, runs style checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low).\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code executes benign subprocesses for code formatting and reads configuration files.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly due to reliance on external files and dynamic import, which could be manipulated if the source is compromised, but there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, standard setup script.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly higher due to dynamic import and dependency management, but overall very safe.\n\n**Final note:** The main concern would be the integrity of the 'nemo/package_info.py' file. If that file is compromised, it could inject malicious metadata or code. However, based solely on this setup script and reports, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py for a Python package with no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, assuming the source files are trustworthy.",
