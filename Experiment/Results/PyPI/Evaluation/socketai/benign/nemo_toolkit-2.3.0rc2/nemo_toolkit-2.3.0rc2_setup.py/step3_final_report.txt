  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, managing dependencies, package metadata, and code style checks.",
  "sources": "Imports 'package_info' from 'nemo/package_info.py', reads requirements files, README, and executes subprocess calls for 'isort' and 'black'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls invoke external formatting tools; no untrusted data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads package info and requirements, then runs subprocess commands for code style enforcement.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of 'package_info' could be a concern if the source file is compromised, but this is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. It loads package metadata dynamically, manages dependencies from multiple requirement files, and includes a custom command for code style checks. The subprocess calls are limited to 'isort' and 'black', which are benign tools. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dynamic import of 'package_info' is common but warrants source integrity verification. Overall, the script is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup.py with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the reliance on external 'package_info.py', which should be verified for integrity in secure environments. Scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2.",
