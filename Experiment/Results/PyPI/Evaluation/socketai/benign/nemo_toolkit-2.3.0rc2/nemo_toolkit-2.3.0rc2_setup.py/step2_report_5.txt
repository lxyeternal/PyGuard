  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and determine the accuracy of their assessments, as well as whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Setup script, dependency management, code style checks.  \n- Sources: Imports 'package_info', reads requirements, runs subprocess for 'isort' and 'black'.  \n- Anomalies: None detected.  \n- Analysis: Standard setup.py, no malicious behavior, subprocess limited to formatting tools.  \n- Conclusion: Typical, safe, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a typical setup.py script.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity.  \n- Subprocess calls are benign.  \n- Dynamic import of 'package_info' is standard in single-sourcing version info.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to reliance on external 'package_info.py', but not malicious)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Similar setup script, dependency management, style checks.  \n- Sources: Reads 'package_info', requirements, README.  \n- Anomalies: None detected.  \n- Analysis: Standard setup.py, no malicious code, no external threats.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate setup script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Setup script, dependencies, metadata, style checks.  \n- Sources: Imports 'package_info', reads requirements, runs subprocess for style checks.  \n- Anomalies: Notes that dynamic import of 'package_info' could be risky if compromised; subprocess calls are fixed, so low risk.  \n- Analysis: Standard setup, but cautions about dynamic import source integrity.  \n- Conclusion: Generally safe, but source of 'package_info' should be trusted.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher due to dynamic import concern, but not malicious)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. Slightly cautious but justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Setup script, dependencies, style checks.  \n- Sources: Reads 'package_info', requirements, README, runs subprocess.  \n- Anomalies: No hardcoded secrets, benign subprocess calls.  \n- Analysis: Standard, no malicious activity, subprocess calls are safe.  \n- Conclusion: Legitimate setup script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Setup, dependencies, style checks.  \n- Sources: Reads 'package_info', requirements, runs subprocess.  \n- Anomalies: No malicious code, subprocess only for formatting tools.  \n- Analysis: Standard, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Typical setup script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1–0.2 (low, justified by reliance on external files and dynamic import)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging.\n- **Malware potential:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior or malware signals. The subprocess calls are only for code style tools, which are benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Risk scores:** The assigned scores are generally low, justified by the reliance on external files and dynamic import, which are common in such scripts but could pose minimal risk if the external files are compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly elevated due to dynamic import of 'package_info', which depends on source integrity, but not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script for a Python package, with dependency management and code style enforcement. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and justified.",
