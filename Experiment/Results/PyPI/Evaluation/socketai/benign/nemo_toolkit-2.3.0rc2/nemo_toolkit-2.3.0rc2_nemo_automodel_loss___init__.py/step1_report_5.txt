{
  "purpose": "The code defines an export list for specific loss functions used in a neural network model, likely related to sequence modeling or classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'nemo.automodel.loss' package, specifically 'chunked_cross_entropy' and 'masked_cross_entropy'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues; the code only imports and exports functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exposes functions for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from the 'nemo.automodel.loss' submodules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It is a minimal, standard module setup for exposing specific functions. No user input, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard module export script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply makes two loss functions available for external modules.",
