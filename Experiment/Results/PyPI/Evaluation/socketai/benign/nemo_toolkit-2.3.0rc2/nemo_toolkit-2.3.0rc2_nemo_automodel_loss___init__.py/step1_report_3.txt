  "purpose": "Export specific loss functions (chunked_cross_entropy and masked_cross_entropy) from the nemo.automodel.loss package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'chunked_cross_entropy' and 'masked_cross_entropy' from submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked.",
  "flows": "Importing functions directly from internal modules; no data flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements with no unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific functions and defines an __all__ list for exports. It only involves standard import statements and a list declaration. There are no signs of data processing, user input, or other risky behaviors. The code appears to be part of a larger package structure and functions solely as an interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard in structure.",
