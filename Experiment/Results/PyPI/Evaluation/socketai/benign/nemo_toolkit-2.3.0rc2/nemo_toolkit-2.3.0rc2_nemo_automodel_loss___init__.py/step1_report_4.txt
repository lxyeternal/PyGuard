{
  "purpose": "Expose and re-export specific loss functions from the nemo.automodel.loss module for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from nemo.automodel.loss.chunked_ce and nemo.automodel.loss.masked_ce",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data outputs; only module imports and exports",
  "flows": "Imported loss functions are re-exported for use in other modules, no untrusted data flow detected",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; straightforward import/export statements, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions from internal modules within 'nemo.automodel.loss' and re-exports them. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or external network interactions. The code appears to serve as an interface or API layer, which is common and legitimate in software projects. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports selected functions for easier access, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
