{
  "purpose": "This code exports specific loss functions from the nemo.automodel.loss module, likely for use in machine learning training or evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own file during import and references external modules: nemo.automodel.loss.chunked_ce and nemo.automodel.loss.masked_ce.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions from external modules and exposes them via __all__, without processing or passing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard module export.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from internal modules, defines an __all__ list for exports, and contains licensing comments. No dynamic execution, data processing, or external network interactions are present. It appears to be a straightforward module export script, typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module export script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes certain functions for external use.",
