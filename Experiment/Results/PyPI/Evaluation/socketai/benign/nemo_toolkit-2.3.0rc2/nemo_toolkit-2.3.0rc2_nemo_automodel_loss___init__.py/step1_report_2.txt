{
  "purpose": "Exports specific loss functions from the nemo.automodel.loss package for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from nemo.automodel.loss.chunked_ce and nemo.automodel.loss.masked_ce modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data or external effects are directly involved.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import/export statements with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two specific loss functions from the nemo.automodel.loss submodules and exposes them in the module's __all__ list for external use. There are no dynamic code executions, data handling, or network activities. The license information indicates compliance with open-source licensing, but does not suggest malicious intent. The code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package module, serving as an interface to re-export functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports selected functions without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. No security risks are evident.",
