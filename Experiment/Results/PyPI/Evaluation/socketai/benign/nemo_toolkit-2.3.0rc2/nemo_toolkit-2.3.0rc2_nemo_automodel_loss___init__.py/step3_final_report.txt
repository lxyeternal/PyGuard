  "purpose": "This module imports two functions related to cross-entropy loss from internal nemo modules and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from nemo.automodel.loss submodules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely re-exports functions",
  "flows": "Import of functions, then exposure via __all__ (no data flow or processing)",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import and export pattern, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign module that imports specific functions and exposes them via __all__. It contains licensing comments and no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as a straightforward, safe module with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent. There are no anomalies or security concerns; the code is standard for a package's interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for re-exporting functions with no malicious or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
