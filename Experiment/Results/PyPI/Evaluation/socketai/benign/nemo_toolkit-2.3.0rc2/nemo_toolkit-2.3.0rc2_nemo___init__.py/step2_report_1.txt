  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Potential Issues:**\n   - The code snippet is a standard header with license information and an import statement importing metadata variables from `nemo.package_info`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic within this snippet.\n   - The imported variables appear to be straightforward metadata, which is common and generally safe.\n\n2. **Reports Summary:**\n   - All five reports indicate an \"Empty response\" with no additional details.\n   - Since the raw responses are empty, there is no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or issues from these reports.\n   - The absence of detailed responses prevents a thorough review of potential issues.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports lack content; thus, they do not provide any reasoning, evidence, or context to evaluate.\n   - This suggests either a reporting failure or that the reports are placeholders without substantive findings.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Without detailed findings, assigning high malware or risk scores is unwarranted.\n   - The reports do not justify any elevated scores; they simply state \"Empty response.\"\n   - Therefore, any high scores would be unreasonable based solely on this data.\n\n5. **Assessment of the Code and Reports:**\n   - The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - The reports do not provide evidence to challenge this or suggest vulnerabilities.\n   - The lack of detailed responses indicates no detected issues or possibly incomplete reporting.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - Given the absence of evidence, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n   - The risk score should be **low (e.g., 0.1)**, reflecting no detected issues but acknowledging the lack of detailed information.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code snippet is safe and standard.\n- The reports are empty; no issues can be confirmed or refuted.\n- Scores should be minimal, reflecting no detected malware or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis cautious approach aligns with the available evidence and maintains a critical stance given the lack of detailed reports.",
