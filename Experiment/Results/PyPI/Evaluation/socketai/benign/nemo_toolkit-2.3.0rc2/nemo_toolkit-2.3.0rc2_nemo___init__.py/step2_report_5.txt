  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The provided code snippet is a standard metadata import from `nemo.package_info`. It appears to be boilerplate code for package information, with no apparent malicious or vulnerable logic.\n   - The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no detailed raw responses. This suggests that the reports lack substantive content or analysis regarding the code or its behavior.\n   - Since no specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activities are described, there is no evidence to suggest that the code itself is compromised or problematic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - All reports are essentially empty, providing no insights, findings, or explanations.\n   - This lack of detail makes it impossible to verify or evaluate any claims about security issues, malware, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports seem incomplete or improperly generated, which limits their usefulness.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Given the absence of any actual findings, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should logically be very low or zero.\n   - Assigning high scores without evidence would be unjustified and could lead to false positives.\n   - Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are described, scores like 0.0 for malware and obfuscated, and a very low risk score (e.g., 0.0 or 0.1) are appropriate.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The reports do not make any claims, so there is nothing to challenge.\n   - Any assumption of malicious intent or vulnerabilities based solely on empty reports would be unfounded.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - Since the reports are empty, the scores should reflect the absence of findings.\n   - No adjustment is needed unless future reports provide concrete evidence.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code snippet provided appears benign and standard.\n   - The reports lack data, so no evidence of issues exists.\n   - The scores should be minimal, reflecting no detected malware or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (to account for the possibility of undisclosed issues, but practically negligible)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are empty and do not provide any evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code itself is standard and appears safe. The scores should be set to reflect the lack of findings, with no justification for higher scores based on the current data.",
