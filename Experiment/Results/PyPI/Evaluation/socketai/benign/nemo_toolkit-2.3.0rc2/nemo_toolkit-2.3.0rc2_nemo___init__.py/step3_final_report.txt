  "purpose": "Import package metadata variables from nemo.package_info for use within the package or project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the nemo.package_info module, which contains package metadata such as contact info, description, URLs, and version info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; it only imports variables and does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing static metadata variables; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward and standard for package metadata import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header followed by an import statement for package metadata variables. No executable logic, user input, or external data processing occurs. The imported variables are static metadata, which are safe and common in open source packages. The reports provided are empty, indicating no additional findings or issues. Given the lack of suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior, and the absence of evidence in the reports, the code appears benign. The empty reports suggest either a reporting failure or no issues detected. Therefore, there is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The reports are empty and do not provide evidence of issues. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal, reflecting the lack of detected problems.",
