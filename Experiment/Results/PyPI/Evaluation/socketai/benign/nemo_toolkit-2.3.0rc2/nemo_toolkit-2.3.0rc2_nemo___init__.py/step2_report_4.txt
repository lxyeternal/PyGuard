  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The provided code is a standard metadata import block from the `nemo.package_info` module. It only imports package metadata variables.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities within this snippet.\n   - Since the reports contain only \"Empty response\" messages, there is no detailed information or evidence of issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - All reports are empty, providing no substantive details about potential issues.\n   - Without actual responses or findings, it's impossible to verify or refute any claims.\n   - The reports seem to lack content, which might indicate either an error in report generation or a lack of actual findings.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - Given the absence of information, any assigned scores for malware, obfuscation, or risk should be minimal or zero.\n   - Assigning higher scores without evidence would be unreasonable.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are demonstrated, the risk score should be close to 0.\n   - The malware score should also be 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n   - Obfuscation score should be 0, as the code is straightforward and unaltered.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - Any claims of vulnerabilities or malicious activity based solely on empty reports are unfounded.\n   - Without concrete evidence, it's inappropriate to assume any risk.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - Given the lack of data, scores should reflect no detected issues.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\n- The reports do not provide any evidence of issues.\n- The code snippet is benign and standard.\n- No adjustments needed; scores should be minimal.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the available information, I recommend that all scores remain at zero, indicating no detected issues or malicious activity.",
