  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Context**:\n   - The code snippet is a standard license header and an import statement importing metadata variables from `nemo.package_info`.\n   - There is no executable logic, no suspicious code, and no apparent vulnerabilities within this snippet.\n   - The imported variables seem to be metadata attributes about the package, which is typical for open source projects.\n\n2. **Reports Summary**:\n   - All five reports contain an \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - No detailed findings, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are described in these reports.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - Since the reports contain no actual data, errors, or evidence of issues, there is no basis to confirm or deny the presence of security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The reports appear to be placeholders or incomplete, lacking substantive information.\n\n4. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - The reports do not provide any evidence or reasoning to support claims of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n   - Without content, it's impossible to evaluate the correctness of the reports or their scoring.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since no issues are described, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be **0**.\n   - Assigning higher scores without evidence would be unjustified and could lead to false positives.\n\n6. **Potential for Malicious Code or Vulnerabilities**:\n   - The provided code snippet appears benign: it only imports metadata variables.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- Given the lack of evidence, I would assign:\n  - **Malware score: 0**\n  - **Obfuscated score: 0**\n  - **Risk score: 0**\n\n- The reports should be revisited once actual data or findings are available. As it stands, there is no indication of any security concern.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign.\n- The reports are empty; no issues can be confirmed.\n- Scores should all be zero due to lack of evidence.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on the current information, there is no reason to suspect malware, obfuscation, or risk in this package.",
