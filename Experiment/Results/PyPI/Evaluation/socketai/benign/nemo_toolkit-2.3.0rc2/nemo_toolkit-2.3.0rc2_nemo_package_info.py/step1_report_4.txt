  "purpose": "This code defines versioning and metadata information for the 'nemo_toolkit' Python package, including version numbers, contact info, URLs, and description.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals defining version info, contact details, URLs, and metadata",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static data used throughout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes package metadata and version information. It includes constants, string concatenations, and URL links. No input handling, no data processing, no network connections or dynamic code execution. All variables are static, and the code appears to be part of a package setup or versioning module. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely metadata setup for a Python package, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
