  "purpose": "This code defines version information and metadata for the 'nemo_toolkit' package, including contact details and URLs.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals used to store metadata, such as version numbers, contact info, URLs, and license.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only contains static definitions and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely informational, setting package metadata variables with static values. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communication, or system modifications. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The presence of contact emails and URLs is typical for package metadata, and no sensitive secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The license and contact information are publicly available details for the package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of metadata definitions for the 'nemo_toolkit' package. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and appears to be standard package documentation and versioning information.",
