  "purpose": "Static package metadata defining version, contact info, URLs, and licensing details for the 'nemo_toolkit' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static variables for version info, contact details, URLs, and descriptive strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only static metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining package metadata such as version numbers, contact info, URLs, and license details. There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, network calls, obfuscation, or embedded malicious code. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the benign and metadata-only nature of the code. The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain any suspicious patterns or anomalies. The assessments in the reports are consistent with the code content, and no logical flaws or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static package metadata file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
