{
  "purpose": "Provide a WSGI-compatible demo application and deprecate old test browser support for Zope 3.",
  "sources": "Import of wsgiref.simple_server.demo_app; no other external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "The function demo_app calls wsgiref_demo_app and encodes its output if not in bytes.",
  "flows": "environ and start_response are input sources; refout from wsgiref_demo_app is processed before being returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors. The Browser class raises NotImplementedError as intended for deprecated support.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a WSGI demo application that wraps wsgiref.simple_server.demo_app, ensuring output is in bytes. It deprecates an old test browser class by raising NotImplementedError, indicating it should no longer be used. The demo_app function processes the output from the reference app, encoding strings to bytes to maintain WSGI compliance. There are no external inputs that could be malicious, no code injection, and no suspicious network or data leaks present. The code is straightforward, primarily serving as a compatibility or testing stub.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, benign test/demo code with no malicious intent. It manages WSGI application responses safely and deprecates outdated test classes appropriately. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected.",
