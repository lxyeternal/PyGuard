{
  "purpose": "Provide a WSGI-compatible demo application and a test browser class for Zope 3 testing environment.",
  "sources": "Import from wsgiref.simple_server and internal references to the demo_app function.",
  "sinks": "The demo_app function processes environ and start_response parameters, but these are standard for WSGI applications; no untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input (environ, start_response) -> wsgiref_demo_app -> processes output, which is then encoded to bytes if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "The Browser class explicitly raises NotImplementedError, indicating it is a placeholder or deprecated. The demo_app function encodes non-byte strings to utf-8, but this is standard in WSGI apps and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a placeholder Browser class that raises an error, indicating it is non-functional and intended for testing or legacy support. The demo_app function wraps a standard WSGI demo application, ensuring output is byte-encoded, which is typical in WSGI applications. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No suspicious network calls, data leaks, or obfuscated code are detected. The code's purpose is straightforward: to serve as a demo WSGI app and a stub for a deprecated Browser class.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign testing utility with no malicious behavior. It mainly wraps an existing demo WSGI application and includes a deprecated placeholder class. There are no security risks or malware indications.",
