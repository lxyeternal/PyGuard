{
  "purpose": "A compatibility and testing utility wrapping a standard WSGI demo app, with a deprecated Browser class for legacy support.",
  "sources": "The demo_app function calls wsgiref_demo_app; the Browser class does not read external input but raises NotImplementedError.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks; the code only wraps existing functions and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "The demo_app function receives environ and start_response, calls the standard demo app, and encodes unicode responses to bytes; no external data flows or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The Browser class raises NotImplementedError as a placeholder for deprecated support; no other anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard WSGI demo app, wraps it to ensure byte output, and defines a deprecated Browser class that raises an exception. It performs no network activity, data leaks, or malicious operations. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. All signals indicate benign, utility code intended for testing or compatibility, with no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for testing within the Zope framework, with no malicious or security concerns. All signals and scores align with a safe, non-malicious assessment.",
