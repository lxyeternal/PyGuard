{
  "purpose": "This code provides a WSGI demo application and a deprecated Browser class for testing purposes within the Zope framework.",
  "sources": "Imports wsgiref.simple_server.demo_app, calls to wsgiref_demo_app within demo_app",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "The demo_app function receives environ and start_response, calls wsgiref_demo_app, and encodes output to bytes if needed",
  "anomalies": "The Browser class raises NotImplementedError, indicating deprecation; no unusual or suspicious code is present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard WSGI demo app from the wsgiref library, defines a wrapper function demo_app that ensures the response is in bytes, and a class Browser that is explicitly not implemented. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or insecure operations. The code is straightforward, mainly serving as a test or demo utility. No hardcoded secrets, external data leaks, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple WSGI demo and deprecation warning for a test browser class. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
