  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details against the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a benign, straightforward WSGI demo application with a deprecated Browser class that raises NotImplementedError.\n- The code imports 'demo_app' from 'wsgiref.simple_server' and wraps it to ensure output is in bytes.\n- The 'Browser' class is intentionally non-functional, raising NotImplementedError, indicating deprecation.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are mentioned or evident.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious activities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, justified by the benign nature.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code's purpose is clear, and the reasoning in the reports aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Scores:\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the straightforwardness.\n- The 'malware' and 'obfuscated' scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are all 0, justified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No issues warrant a higher risk or malware score. The code is explicitly benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent, accurate, and thorough.\n- The code is a benign utility for testing and compatibility, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a simple, benign WSGI demo application with a deprecated class, and there are no security issues or malware present. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
