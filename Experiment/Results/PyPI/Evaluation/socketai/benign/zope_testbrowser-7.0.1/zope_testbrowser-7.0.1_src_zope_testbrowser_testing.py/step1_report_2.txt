{
  "purpose": "Provide a WSGI-compatible demo application and maintain backward compatibility for Zope 3 testing.",
  "sources": "Import of wsgiref.simple_server.demo_app and usage within demo_app function",
  "sinks": "The demo_app function outputs data via the WSGI start_response callback, but only returns data processed from a trusted library",
  "flows": "environ and start_response are inputs; demo_app processes the data and returns a list of bytes or encoded strings",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard WSGI demo application and wraps it to ensure output is in bytes, compatible with PEP-3333. The Browser class explicitly raises NotImplementedError, serving as a deprecation notice. There are no external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code is straightforward, focusing on compatibility and deprecation messaging without any malicious intent or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a compatibility or testing stub. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
