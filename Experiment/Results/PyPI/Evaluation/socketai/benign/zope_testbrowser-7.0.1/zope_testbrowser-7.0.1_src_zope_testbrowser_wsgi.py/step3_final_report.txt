  "purpose": "Testing framework for WSGI applications, handling authorization headers, middleware, and test setup/teardown procedures.",
  "sources": "Reads HTTP headers (authorization), environment variables, class attributes, and global variables for app state.",
  "sinks": "Encodes user credentials into base64, modifies environment variables, filters headers in response.",
  "flows": "Encodes credentials from headers, updates environment variables, filters headers before response, manages global app state during tests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variable `_APP_UNDER_TEST` for managing app state; standard header encoding and filtering; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard testing infrastructure for WSGI applications, including header encoding for Basic Auth, header filtering, and layered setup/teardown. It uses common libraries (`base64`, `re`) and patterns. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The global variable `_APP_UNDER_TEST` is typical in test environments but should be used cautiously outside testing. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing infrastructure for WSGI applications, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are consistent with its purpose and implementation.",
