  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Testing framework for WSGI, handling authorization headers.\n- Sources/Sinks: Reads headers, environment variables; encodes credentials with base64.\n- Flows: Encodes user/pass into base64, modifies headers.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior; standard header encoding.\n- Analysis: Straightforward test utility, no malware or malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate testing code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, due to global state management), confidence=0.95.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: WSGI testing utilities, including authorization handling.\n- Sources/Sinks: Reads headers, encodes credentials, modifies environment.\n- Flows: Encodes credentials, modifies environ, filters headers.\n- Anomalies: No secrets or backdoors; standard encoding.\n- Analysis: Typical testing infrastructure, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No signs of malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Testing infrastructure, browser class, middleware, setup/teardown.\n- Sources/Sinks: Reads headers, environment variables; encodes credentials.\n- Flows: Similar to above; global variable for app state.\n- Anomalies: Use of global variable _APP_UNDER_TEST; encoding credentials is standard.\n- Analysis: Standard test setup code, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Testing framework, middleware, header handling.\n- Sources/Sinks: Reads environment, headers; encodes credentials.\n- Flows: Similar encoding and header filtering.\n- Anomalies: No secrets or suspicious code; standard practices.\n- Analysis: Typical testing infrastructure, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate testing code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Testing infrastructure, authorization handling.\n- Sources/Sinks: Reads headers, environment; encodes credentials.\n- Flows: Encodes credentials, modifies environ, filters headers.\n- Anomalies: No secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard testing setup, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate testing code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscation. The code is purely for testing and header handling.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, as the code is standard testing infrastructure, with only minor concerns about global state management (which is typical in tests but not malicious).\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, related to global state management, but not security-critical)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is standard testing infrastructure for WSGI applications, handling authorization headers securely and transparently. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, non-malicious testing utility with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.",
