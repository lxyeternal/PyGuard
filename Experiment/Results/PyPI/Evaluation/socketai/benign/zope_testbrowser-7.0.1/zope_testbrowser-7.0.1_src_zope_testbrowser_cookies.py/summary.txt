  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing cookies in a testing environment. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal inherent risk in cookie handling code, with no malicious activity detected."
