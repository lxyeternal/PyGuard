  "purpose": "The code provides helper classes and functions for managing cookies within a test browser environment, including creating, modifying, and retrieving cookies, as well as handling cookie policies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the URL, request headers, cookie data, and cookie expiration data. Data is read primarily from cookie jar, request headers, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence cookie creation, modification, or deletion. The main sinks are the _setCookie method (which writes cookies to the jar) and header generation functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (e.g., parameters for create/change methods) through validation, then into cookie objects which are stored and managed within the cookie jar. Cookies are eventually sent as headers or stored internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward implementation for cookie management. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data leaks are evident. The use of _StubResponse and _StubHTTPMessage is for testing purposes, consistent with the test environment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a cookie management helper class designed for testing environments. It interacts with a cookie jar and handles cookie creation, modification, deletion, and retrieval with validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication to external servers, data exfiltration, or hidden code. The functions and classes are typical for cookie handling with proper validation and error handling. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code maintains standard security practices for cookie management, and no evidence suggests sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for cookie handling in a testing context. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as intended for managing cookies safely within a test browser environment.",
