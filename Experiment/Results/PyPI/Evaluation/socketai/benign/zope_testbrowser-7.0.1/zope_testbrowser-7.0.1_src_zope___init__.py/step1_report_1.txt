  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems are present",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and declaring namespace does not create data flow or trust boundary issues",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' is unusual but not inherently malicious; it dynamically imports a module, which can be risky if misused, but here it's standard for namespace declaration",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkg_resources' module and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern used in Python package management to allow multiple packages to share a namespace. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The use of '__import__' is functional and contextually appropriate for namespace declaration, not suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard namespace declaration using dynamic import. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate and related to package setup.",
