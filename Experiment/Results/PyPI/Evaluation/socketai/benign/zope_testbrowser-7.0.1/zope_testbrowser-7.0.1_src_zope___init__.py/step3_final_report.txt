  "purpose": "Namespace declaration for Python package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "Import of 'pkg_resources' via __import__ and call to declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external system interaction, no data leaks",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' -> call to declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string literal is unusual but standard in namespace declarations; no malicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package. It does not process untrusted input, perform I/O, or interact with external systems. The pattern is common in Python packaging and poses no security risks. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The use of __import__ is standard for dynamic imports in this context. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
