  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external effect mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data propagation paths in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string argument; minimal, standard namespace declaration. No suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module dynamically using __import__, then calls declare_namespace on __name__. This is a common pattern in Python namespace packages. No data is read from external sources, no untrusted data is processed, and no side effects or malicious actions are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward namespace declaration with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package declaration using pkg_resources, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
