  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Import statement: __import__('pkg_resources')",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code solely performs namespace declaration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal namespace declaration; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares the current package as a namespace package via declare_namespace. This is a standard method for managing namespace packages in Python and does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. It neither reads input nor writes output, nor does it involve network activity or data processing. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears as a standard practice for namespace packages and poses no security risks.",
