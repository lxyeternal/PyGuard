{
  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with the current module's name",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present in this code fragment",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply performs namespace declaration",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library component 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python packaging for modular packages. The code is minimal and does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It is a typical setup statement for namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration using 'pkg_resources' and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
