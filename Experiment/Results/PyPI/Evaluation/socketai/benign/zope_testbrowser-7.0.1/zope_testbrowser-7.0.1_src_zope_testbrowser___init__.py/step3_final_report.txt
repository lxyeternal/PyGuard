  "purpose": "This code contains only licensing comments and a brief module docstring describing a 'Browser Simulator for Functional DocTests'.",
  "sources": "The license header comments and the module docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or untrusted data processing present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist as there is no executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; only comments and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a module docstring with no executable statements, data flows, or logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the content. There are no anomalies or suspicious elements. The analysis confirms that the code is purely informational and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only licensing comments and documentation. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the content. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present, and the security risk is negligible.",
