  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code snippet carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- It contains only licensing comments and a brief module docstring.\n- No executable code, data input/output, or logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n- All five reports correctly identify that the code is purely informational, consisting of license headers and documentation.\n- They consistently conclude there are no security risks, no malware, and no suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- The obfuscated and malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the content.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n- The security risk score is 0, also appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or reasoning flaws:**\n- No issues are present in the reports; they are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning is sound: static comments and license headers do not pose security threats.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is purely based on code content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- Given the code snippet, I agree with all the scores and assessments.\n- No further action or score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the actual content of the code snippet.",
