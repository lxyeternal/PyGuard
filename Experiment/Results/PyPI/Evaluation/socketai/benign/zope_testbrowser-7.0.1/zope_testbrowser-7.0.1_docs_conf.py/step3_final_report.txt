  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation, setting up extensions, paths, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Standard module imports (`sys`, `os`) and static assignment of configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-formed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured Sphinx configuration script with no dynamic code, network activity, or sensitive data handling. It imports only standard modules and assigns configuration parameters. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with its benign, static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a standard documentation configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
