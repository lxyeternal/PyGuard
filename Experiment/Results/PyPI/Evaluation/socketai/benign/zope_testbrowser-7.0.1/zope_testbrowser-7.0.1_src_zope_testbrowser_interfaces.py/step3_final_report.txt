{
  "purpose": "The code defines interfaces and schemas for cookie management, web browser interactions, and form controls within a web testing framework, serving as type contracts and interface declarations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code reads no input or data beyond schema definitions and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions; it only declares interfaces.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code contains only interface signatures without implementation or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code is purely declarative with standard interface and schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of interface and schema declarations using zope.interface and zope.schema, with no executable logic, data handling, network calls, or system modifications. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious code are present. The code serves as a contract for web testing components and does not pose any security or malicious threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is purely declarative, defining interfaces for web testing components without any executable or external data processing. The scores are consistent with the code content.",
