  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, consisting of interface and schema definitions for a web testing framework.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network communication, or system modifications are present.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious strings, or dynamic code execution detected.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n- The confidence levels are high, indicating strong consensus.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the code is well-structured, standard, and adheres to expected patterns.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, appropriate.\n  - Security risk: 0, appropriate.\n- **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5):** None needed; all evidence points to benign, declarative interface definitions.\n\n### Critical Points:\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as non-executable, purely defining interfaces and schemas.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the absence of executable code or external interactions.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the detailed analysis and consensus, I concur with the provided scores:\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Security risk: **0**\n\n**Additional note:** Since the code is purely declarative, there is no basis for higher scores. The code poses no supply chain security threat or malware potential.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus in the reports.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign interface/schema declaration module for a web testing framework, with no malicious or security concerns.",
