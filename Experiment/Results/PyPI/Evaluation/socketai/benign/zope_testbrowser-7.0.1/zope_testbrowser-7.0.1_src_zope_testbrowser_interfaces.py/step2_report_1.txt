  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines interfaces and schemas for cookie management and web interactions.  \n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No external data, network, or system command usage.  \n- **Anomalies:** None detected; code is purely interface/schema declarations.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is standard, declarative, and contains no executable logic or malicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security risk or malware potential.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines interfaces/classes for a web testing framework, cookies, forms, and controls.  \n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Methods like `create()`, `change()`, `open()`, `submit()` could process untrusted data, but they are only signatures without implementations.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; purely interface/schema declarations.  \n- **Analysis:** No executable code or data processing; no external calls or secrets.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, defining interfaces for a web testing environment.  \n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Only interface signatures and schema declarations; no actual logic or data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** None; standard interface definitions.  \n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no external data processing, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malware.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines interfaces and schemas for browser functionalities, cookies, and controls.  \n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** All are declarative, with no implementation or data processing.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard interface/schema declarations, no executable logic.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines interfaces for a browser testing framework, similar to previous reports.  \n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data processing or external communication; purely interface/schema definitions.  \n- **Anomalies:** None detected.  \n- **Analysis:** No executable code, no secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malware.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code content:** All reports are solely interface and schema declarations with no executable logic, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware score:** All are correctly scored as 0.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are correctly scored as 0.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any executable or external interaction, a risk score of 0 is appropriate for all.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard, declarative, and intended for defining interfaces and schemas for web testing frameworks.  \n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.  \n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk or attack surface)\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scoring and analysis are appropriate and accurate.",
