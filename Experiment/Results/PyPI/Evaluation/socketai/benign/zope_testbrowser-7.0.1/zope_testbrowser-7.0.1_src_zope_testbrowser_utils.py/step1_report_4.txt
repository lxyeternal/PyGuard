    "Import statements: re, time, urllib.parse, calendar.timegm",
    "Function my_timegm: input tuple of time components",
    "Function http2time: string parsing for date/time conversions",

  "sinks": [
    "None observed. All data handling is limited to parsing, string processing, and safe computations.",
    "urllib.parse.urlsplit used for URL parsing, which is standard and safe.",
    "Regular expressions used for parsing date strings and hostnames, with no code injection or command execution involved."

  "flows": [
    "request_host retrieves URL, extracts host, removes port",
    "http2time parses date strings into epoch seconds",
    "offset_from_tz_string interprets timezone offsets",
    "_str2time converts date components into epoch seconds with timezone adjustments",
    "effective_request_host normalizes hostname for comparison"

  "anomalies": [
    "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
    "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.",
    "Regular expressions and date/time functions are used in standard ways without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
    "All functions appear to perform utility parsing and data normalization tasks without side effects."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for date/time parsing and hostname extraction, using standard Python libraries and regular expressions. The functions include safety checks and handle edge cases like timezone offsets and date formats. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network communications to untrusted domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The parsing logic is straightforward and consistent with standard practices, with no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate utility code for handling HTTP date strings and hostnames. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signatures. It performs safe string parsing and conversions, with no evident security risks.",
