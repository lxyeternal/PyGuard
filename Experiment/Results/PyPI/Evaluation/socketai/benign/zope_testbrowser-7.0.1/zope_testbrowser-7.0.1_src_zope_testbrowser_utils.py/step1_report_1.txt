{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for parsing and handling HTTP date strings, time conversions, and extracting host information from requests.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request objects (request.get_full_url(), request.get_header()), and processes string data for date parsing and host extraction.",
  "sinks": "Returns processed data such as time in seconds since epoch, hostnames, and time components. No untrusted data is sent elsewhere or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input request URLs or headers -> parsing functions (http2time, request_host) -> processed output (times, hostnames).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; all functions perform standard parsing and conversion without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs parsing of date strings, time conversions, and hostname extraction. It uses regex for pattern matching and handles timezone offsets carefully. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious external communications are present. Functions like 'http2time' and 'request_host' process untrusted input but do so in a standard, safe manner. There are no indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions for date and hostname parsing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on input data for legitimate purposes. No malware or suspicious behavior detected.",
