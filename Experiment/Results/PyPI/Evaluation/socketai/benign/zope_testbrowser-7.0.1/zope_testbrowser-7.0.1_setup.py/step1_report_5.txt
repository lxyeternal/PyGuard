  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.testbrowser package, including dependency declarations and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files, and static setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external inputs are processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> defining setup parameters -> invoking setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with conventional package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script reads local files for long description content and defines package metadata and dependencies. All operations are static and controlled. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or external data handling is present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The dependencies and package information are standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs static file reads and package metadata definition, which are typical in Python package distribution.",
