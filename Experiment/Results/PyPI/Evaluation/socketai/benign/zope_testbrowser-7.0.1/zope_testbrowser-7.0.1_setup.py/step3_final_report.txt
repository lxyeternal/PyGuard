  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.testbrowser package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Static files ('README.rst', 'CHANGES.rst') and hardcoded strings within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; all data sources are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Reading static files into variables, then passing these variables to setup() without dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static data reads and dependency declarations. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted input handling are present. The dependencies are well-known packages, and no obfuscation or secrets are included. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores are justified and appropriate.",
