  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.testbrowser package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long description; static code defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "File reads flow to variables used in setup; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs found. The code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for package setup, reads static documentation files, and defines setup parameters including dependencies, metadata, and classifiers. No dynamic execution, network operations, or input handling is present. All data used is static and controlled. The setup script conforms to typical Python packaging practices without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks detected. It merely prepares the package for distribution using setuptools.",
