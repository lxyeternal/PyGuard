  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, focusing on the key points: presence of issues, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code as an Excel automation interface on macOS, interacting via AppleScript, subprocess, and file system. No anomalies or suspicious activity are noted.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, with high confidence (0.9). This aligns with the code's behavior—standard automation, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.1), reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring and reasoning are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes process monitoring via 'psutil' and process info via 'lsappinfo'. No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9. Correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher (0.2), still reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Well-reasoned, aligns with code behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes the code as a legitimate automation interface, with process checks, path conversions, and macro execution. No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, high confidence=0.9. Correct.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no red flags.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on process detection, AppleScript control, and file operations. No anomalies.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes the code as a standard automation interface, with process detection, macro invocation, and file handling. No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, aligned.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a legitimate, standard automation interface for Excel on macOS.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the thorough descriptions and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** (low, primarily due to system calls and macro execution, which are standard in automation but could be misused if macros are compromised—still, no evidence here)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and aligned with legitimate automation purposes. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate, and the code does not exhibit malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
