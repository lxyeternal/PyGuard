{
  "purpose": "Re-export functions and classes from the '.pro.reports' module for simplified access.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .pro.reports import *' reads all symbols from the '.pro.reports' module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Symbols imported from '.pro.reports' are exposed via '__all__', but no data flows or untrusted inputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported symbols and potentially import malicious or unintended code if the source module is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward re-export module that imports all symbols from '.pro.reports' and exposes specific symbols via '__all__'. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data handling is evident. The primary concern is the wildcard import, which can hide unwanted symbols or malicious code if the imported module is compromised. The code itself is benign, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the minimal risk and standard pattern. The reliance on the integrity of the external module is the main external risk, but within this snippet, no malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module with no signs of malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a common pattern but can pose risks if the imported module is compromised. The scores are consistent with the analysis and do not require adjustment.",
