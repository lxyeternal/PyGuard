  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and scoring justifications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code performs a relative import: `from .pro.reports import *`\n- It defines an `__all__` list to specify exported symbols.\n- The purpose is to re-export functions/classes from `pro.reports` for simplified access.\n- There are no visible data flows, network operations, or untrusted data handling.\n- The use of a wildcard import (`*`) is common in `__init__.py` files but can obscure imported symbols.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports focus mainly on the use of wildcard import (`*`) and the potential risks associated with it. The code itself is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Is there malicious code?**  \n  No, the code is a simple re-export module with no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  The only concern is the use of `*` import, which can hide imported symbols and potentially import malicious or unintended code if the source module is compromised. But this is a common pattern in package `__init__.py` files and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n\n| Issue | Report # | Reported malware | Reported security risk | Justification | Suggested adjustment |\n|---------|------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| **Malware** | 0 | 0 | No evidence of malicious code or behavior | The code does not execute or process untrusted data; no malware present. | Keep at 0. |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0 | 0 | No obfuscation detected | Code is clear and straightforward. | Keep at 0. |\n| **Risk** | 0.1–0.2 | 0 | The main concern is the wildcard import, which can hide malicious symbols if the source module is compromised. | The risk is minimal if the source module is trusted. | Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.1–0.2 is appropriate. |\n\n### Validity of scores:\n\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is justified.\n- `obfuscated` = 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- `securityRisk` varies slightly but remains low, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the use of wildcard import as a minor concern but not malicious.\n- No evidence suggests that the imported module (`pro.reports`) is malicious or compromised.\n- The code's purpose is purely to re-export symbols, a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the analysis, the current scores are reasonable.** The only point of note is the wildcard import, which carries a minimal security concern but is standard practice in module `__init__.py` files.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n| Score Type | Reasoning | Suggested value |\n|--------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Malware** | No malicious code detected. | 0 |\n| **Obfuscated** | Clear code, no obfuscation. | 0 |\n| **Risk** | Minor concern due to wildcard import, but no malicious intent. | 0.1 |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign and does not contain malware.\n- The use of wildcard import is a stylistic choice and not inherently malicious, though it can obscure symbols.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes to scores are necessary unless future analysis of `pro.reports` reveals issues.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep all scores at 0 for malware and obfuscated, and assign a `securityRisk` of approximately 0.1, reflecting the minor concern over wildcard import.",
