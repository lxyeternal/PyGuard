  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a module that re-exports symbols from `.pro.reports` via a wildcard import and an explicit `__all__` list.\n- The code is straightforward: import everything from a submodule and define what is publicly exposed.\n- No evidence of malicious code, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- The primary concern noted is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can hide unwanted symbols or malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The wildcard import could potentially import malicious or unintended symbols if the source module is compromised, but within this snippet, there's no direct indication of malicious intent.\n- The code is benign and serves as a simple interface layer.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is benign, with minor concern over the use of wildcard import.\n- No factual inaccuracies are apparent.\n- The reports correctly identify that the main risk is reliance on the integrity of the imported module, not the code snippet itself.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** all reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** all assign `0`. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** low, around 0.1–0.2, justified by the wildcard import concern.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, malware score should remain at 0.\n- The wildcard import is a stylistic choice, not inherently malicious, but it can be a vector for malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n- Given the context, the risk score of 0.1–0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- The reports correctly state that the code itself does not process untrusted data or perform network/system operations.\n- They recognize that the only potential concern is the imported module's integrity, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (minor concern over wildcard import, but overall benign)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all factors, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** **0** (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (transparent code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to wildcard import risk, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module with a minor stylistic concern. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.",
