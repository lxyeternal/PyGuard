{
  "purpose": "This code provides an alias for using 'xlwings.reports' instead of 'xlwings.pro.reports' and exports specific functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .pro.reports import *",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked",
  "flows": "Importing all contents from a module and exposing specific functions/classes",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can obscure imported functions and potentially import malicious or unwanted code; no explicit validation or filtering of imported contents",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a relative import of all symbols from 'pro.reports' and defining an explicit __all__ list for exported symbols. The wildcard import (*) can potentially import malicious or unintended code if 'pro.reports' is compromised, but it is a common pattern in internal modules. The explicit __all__ list limits what is publicly exposed. There are no suspicious hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or obfuscated code. Overall, this appears to be a simple re-export module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a simple wrapper to facilitate usage of reports within 'xlwings'. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. The use of wildcard import is a minor concern but not inherently malicious.",
