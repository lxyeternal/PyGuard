{
  "purpose": "This code re-exports selected functions and classes from the 'pro.reports' module to provide a simplified interface for using report-related functionalities in xlwings.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from '.pro.reports'",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can obscure actual imported content, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module re-export that simplifies access to reporting functions. It imports all symbols from a submodule and explicitly defines an export list. No input handling, no network operations, and no execution of untrusted code are present. The wildcard import could hide potentially unwanted symbols but, in itself, is not malicious. The code's structure indicates a simple interface layer without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply makes report-related functions accessible under a different namespace. The use of wildcard import is a stylistic choice but not suspicious.",
