{
  "purpose": "This module re-exports specific functions and classes from the 'pro.reports' submodule of the 'xlwings' package, providing a simplified interface for report generation features.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing everything from '.pro.reports' submodule",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any functions or classes imported could be used as sinks if they process untrusted input, but the code itself does not demonstrate data handling or execution of untrusted data",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are visible in this code snippet; it only re-exports symbols from another module",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard (*), which can be risky if the imported module contains malicious code or unexpected side effects, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports all contents from a submodule and defines an '__all__' list to specify exported symbols. The import statement is straightforward, but using a wildcard import can sometimes hide malicious or unintended code from the imported module. However, given this is a standard re-export pattern, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or handle untrusted input. The security risk lies in the imported module, which is not part of this snippet, so we cannot evaluate its contents.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple re-export module with no apparent malicious behavior. The use of a wildcard import is a minor concern but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. Overall, the code is benign, focusing on simplifying access to reporting functions from the 'xlwings' package.",
