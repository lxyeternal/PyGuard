{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'xlwings' Python package, handling dependencies, platform-specific DLL inclusion, optional Rust extensions, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, reading version info from __init__.py, environment variables for dependency control and build options, platform detection for DLL inclusion, and file globbing for DLLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed into system commands, network activity, or external communications; environment variables influence build configuration but are used in a controlled manner.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence dependency inclusion and build options; platform detection determines DLL inclusion; file globbing gathers DLL files for data_files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading static files for metadata, managing dependencies with environment variables, platform-specific DLL inclusion, optional Rust extension compilation, and defining package data. It uses environment variables in typical ways for build configuration, with no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The code structure is straightforward, and the logic aligns with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable usage is typical and does not introduce any security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the script.",
