{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'xlwings', intended for packaging and distribution via setuptools. It manages dependencies, package data, and build options.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst for long description, reading __init__.py for version, environment variables (READTHEDOCS, XLWINGS_NO_DEPS, BUILD_RUST), glob.glob for DLL files, environment variables for build options.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used to modify behavior (READTHEDOCS, XLWINGS_NO_DEPS, BUILD_RUST) influence package setup. No untrusted data directly affects code execution or system state.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and glob.glob influence the configuration but do not process untrusted user input. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that cause security effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to control dependency inclusion and build options is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns observed. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks: reading files, extracting version info, setting dependencies, configuring optional Rust extensions, and packaging data. Dependency management depends on environment variables but does not process untrusted data. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The use of environment variables for build customization is common. No suspicious network calls or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal; no evidence of malicious activity or security flaws was found.",
