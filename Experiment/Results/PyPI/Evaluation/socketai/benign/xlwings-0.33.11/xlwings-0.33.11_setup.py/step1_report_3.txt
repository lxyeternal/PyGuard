{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the xlwings package for distribution, including dependencies, package data, and Rust extension configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, reading version from __init__.py, environment variables, system platform detection, glob for DLLs, importing setuptools and optional setuptools_rust, and reading Cargo.toml if Rust build is enabled.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the script primarily reads files, environment variables, and system info. No untrusted input is processed into vulnerable commands or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence conditional dependency inclusion and DLL data files; file reading and package setup data flow into the final setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code uses standard setup tools and practices, with environment-based conditional logic, but nothing inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup for distribution. It reads static files for description and version, dynamically adds DLLs on Windows, conditionally includes Rust extensions, and specifies dependencies and package data. All operations involve standard Python file I/O, environment variable checks, and package configuration. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of environment variables to control dependencies and build steps is common and not malicious. The code does not execute untrusted inputs or perform network operations. Overall, it appears to be legitimate setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs package configuration tasks securely and transparently. No malware or security risks identified.",
