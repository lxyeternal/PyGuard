  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core code, its behavior, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It initializes environment-specific paths and configurations.\n- Defines custom error classes.\n- Imports core modules and sets up API exports.\n- Handles optional dependencies for different platforms (Windows, macOS).\n- Uses broad exception handling during optional imports.\n- Defines placeholder functions if dependencies are missing.\n- Sets up engines based on available modules.\n- Configures UDF support, with fallback functions if dependencies are absent.\n- Loads constants.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code itself is standard for a package setup, with no evidence of malicious payloads.\n- No code injection, backdoors, or network activity.\n- Use of broad exception handling (`except: pass`) is common but can hide underlying issues, not malicious.\n- Dynamic functions (`func`, `sub`, `ret`, `arg`) are harmless placeholders or identity functions.\n- Optional dependencies are handled gracefully, with fallback functions that raise ImportError when needed.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- Broad exception handling can mask errors, but this is typical in setup scripts.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. All reports agree; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 across reports, reflecting a very low security risk. This seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical points:\n- No evidence supports claims of malicious intent.\n- The broad exception handling, while potentially hiding errors, does not imply malicious activity.\n- The fallback functions are harmless and serve compatibility.\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, **the code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured package initialization script** for xlwings, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n## My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, mainly due to broad exception handling which could hide errors but not malicious intent.\n\n**Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal.**",
