  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a CLI tool for managing xlwings features, including add-in installation/removal, VBA module import/export, code embedding, licensing, configuration, authentication (Azure AD via msal), and server deployment.\n- It performs file operations, system commands, and VBA project modifications.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- External modules used are standard for such tasks (msal, flask, watchgod, pandas, pyperclip).\n- The code uses subprocess for version checks and server runs, which are typical.\n- User prompts and environment variables are handled appropriately.\n- No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Management CLI for xlwings, handling add-ins, VBA, setup, auth.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; primarily file management, configuration, and system commands.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate management script, no malware signals.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for managing add-ins, VBA, embedding code, auth.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, standard operations, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, no signs of malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for add-ins, VBA, licensing, server.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Standard file and system operations, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate tool.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** CLI for add-ins, VBA, auth, configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Typical automation and management tasks, no malicious signals.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, managing add-ins, VBA, licensing, auth.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Same as others, standard operations.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code does not exhibit malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, hidden code, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code appears clear and maintainable.\n- **Risk scores:** Appropriately low, given the nature of the code.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code performs legitimate automation, configuration, and management tasks for xlwings and Excel.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious network calls, or obfuscated/malicious code patterns are present.\n- External calls (subprocess, module imports) are standard and controlled.\n- File operations are predictable and aligned with the tool's purpose.\n- User prompts and environment variables are used responsibly.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1 - 0.2** (minimal, mostly operational risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for managing xlwings features, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk scores are justified, and the overall security posture is sound based on this review.",
