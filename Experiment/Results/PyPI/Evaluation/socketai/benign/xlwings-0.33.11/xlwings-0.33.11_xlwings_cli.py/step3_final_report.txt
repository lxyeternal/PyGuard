  "purpose": "A CLI utility for managing xlwings features including add-in installation/removal, VBA module import/export, code embedding, licensing, configuration, authentication via Azure AD, and deployment workflows.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, environment variables, configuration files, Excel workbooks, VBA projects, user input prompts, environment variables, and file system operations.",
  "sinks": "File copying/deletion, subprocess calls (for Flask server, version checks), VBA project modifications via COM interfaces, clipboard copying, and network calls (e.g., flask server).",
  "flows": "Sources such as CLI args, config files, and environment variables feed into functions that perform file operations, subprocess executions, and VBA project modifications; data flows into system commands, file writes, and VBA imports/exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors. External modules are standard and used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive management CLI for xlwings, performing legitimate automation tasks such as managing add-ins, VBA modules, licensing, and authentication. It uses standard libraries and external modules (msal, flask, watchgod) in a controlled manner. File operations, subprocess calls, and COM interface manipulations are typical for such tools. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The code's structure and behavior align with its purpose, and no suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for xlwings management with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation, and minimal security risk scores are justified. It operates within expected parameters for such automation tools, and no malicious intent is evident.",
