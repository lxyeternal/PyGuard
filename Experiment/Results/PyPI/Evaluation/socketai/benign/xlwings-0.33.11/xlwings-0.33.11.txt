      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable usage is typical and does not introduce any security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the script."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module with no signs of malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a common pattern but can pose risks if the imported module is compromised. The scores are consistent with the analysis and do not require adjustment."

      "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable framework or interface skeleton for Excel automation components. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores reflect the clear understanding that this is purely declarative, non-runtime code with no inherent security concerns."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Excel-Python integration library with features for dynamic module management and automation. While its capabilities could be misused if modules are untrusted, there is no active malicious activity. The current security scores are appropriate, with a very low malware likelihood and minimal obfuscation. The main risk is the potential misuse of dynamic features, which is inherent to such tools but does not indicate malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a COM server facilitating Python object and script management but includes unsafe functions like exec() and eval() that can lead to remote code execution if inputs are untrusted. No active malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk is high due to these functions, and proper input validation or sandboxing is recommended to mitigate potential exploitation."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured CLI utility for xlwings management with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation, and minimal security risk scores are justified. It operates within expected parameters for such automation tools, and no malicious intent is evident."

The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the overall risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, primarily due to broad exception handling but not malicious activity."

The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code is safe to use assuming the module itself is trustworthy."
