  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Code Review Summary:\nThe code is a simple import statement:\n\n```python\n# ruff: noqa: F401\nfrom .pro.udfs_officejs import (\n    custom_functions_call,\n    custom_functions_code,\n    custom_functions_meta,\n    custom_scripts_call,\n    script,\n    sio_connect,\n    sio_custom_function_call,\n    sio_disconnect,\n    xlarg as arg,\n    xlfunc as func,\n    xlret as ret,\n)\n```\n\nThis code only imports functions and variables from a local module. There are no data flows, no code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns evident within this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import functions/variables for later use.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, straightforward import.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import of functions related to office JavaScript UDFs and socket connections.\n- **Analysis:** Aliases like `xlarg as arg` might be for obfuscation but are common practice.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The suspicion about obfuscation is minor and not necessarily malicious. The reasoning is sound; the code remains benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import functions for use in a larger project.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import functions, with potential for later use in sinks.\n- **Analysis:** The note that trust depends on the module is valid; however, at this level, the import is benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is cautious but accurate; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import, noting aliasing.\n- **Analysis:** Aliases may obscure intent but are not inherently malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior. The minor concern about aliasing and obfuscation is acknowledged but not considered suspicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep low (around 0.1), since aliasing is minimal and common.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep very low (~0.1), as this code alone is benign.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The security posture depends heavily on the contents of `pro.udfs_officejs`. If that module contains malicious code, the risk could be higher, but based solely on this import snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n## **Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                                      |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0**           | No evidence of malicious code or behavior in the import statement. |\n| Obfuscated       | **0.1**         | Minor aliasing, common in code organization, not suspicious.      |\n| Security Risk    | **0.1**         | No direct risks observed; depends on the imported module's trustworthiness. |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign import statement, with no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk at this level. The provided reports are consistent with this assessment.",
