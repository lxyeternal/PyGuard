  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from a local module related to 'pro.udfs_officejs'.",

  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from external sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an alias 'xlarg as arg', 'xlfunc as func', and 'xlret as ret' could be an attempt to obscure code intent, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement pulling multiple functions and variables from a local module. The naming suggests these are related to office JavaScript functions, possibly for custom scripting. No code execution, network calls, or data handling is visible. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The only minor concern is the use of aliases that may be intended to obscure understanding, but this is common in code organization and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code, based on the snippet provided.",
