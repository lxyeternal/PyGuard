  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code snippet.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\n# ruff: noqa: F401\nfrom .pro.udfs_officejs import (\n    custom_functions_call,\n    custom_functions_code,\n    custom_functions_meta,\n    custom_scripts_call,\n    script,\n    sio_connect,\n    sio_custom_function_call,\n    sio_disconnect,\n    xlarg as arg,\n    xlfunc as func,\n    xlret as ret,\n)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Importing functions and variables from a local module; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that this is a straightforward import statement. No suspicious patterns, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — minor aliasing, but not suspicious.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, given the context.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that this is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with mention of aliasing (`xlarg as arg`, etc.) possibly being obfuscation but not suspicious.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. Aliases are common, and no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — minor aliasing.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Straightforward import; no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is just importing functions/variables. No dynamic code, no data flow.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Import from local module; trust depends on the module's integrity.\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes that the source module's trustworthiness is unknown, which is valid. The import itself is benign.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to dependency trust issues, but not from the import statement itself.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Import with aliases; no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Aliases are common; no suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — aliasing is normal.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no issues.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that this is a benign import statement.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscation:** Slight aliasing, but not suspicious.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code only imports functions; no data handling or execution.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.2 (minor aliasing, but not malicious)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk; depends on trustworthiness of the module)\n\n**Note:** Since the code only performs imports, and no execution or data handling is evident, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The trustworthiness of the imported module remains a consideration but cannot be assessed here.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code while acknowledging minor aliasing.",
