  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from a local module 'pro.udfs_officejs' for use within the larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions and variables from '.pro.udfs_officejs'.",
  "sinks": "Potential for imported functions to be used in sinks elsewhere; no direct sinks within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported functions/variables could be invoked elsewhere, potentially leading to execution of malicious code if the source module is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns within this import statement itself.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific functions and variables from a local module. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no network calls are present here. The content appears standard for a module import. However, without access to 'pro.udfs_officejs', the trustworthiness of these functions cannot be assessed. The import line is straightforward and does not reveal malicious intent or anomalies at this level.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement from a local module, with no evident malicious behavior or anomalies. The security posture depends on the trustworthiness of the imported module, which cannot be evaluated from this snippet alone.",
