{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and variables from a local module related to office JavaScript UDFs and socket communication, likely for use in scripting or automation tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.pro.udfs_officejs' module, importing functions and variables such as custom_functions_call, script, sio_connect, and aliases like xlarg as arg.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of aliases (e.g., xlarg as arg, xlfunc as func) could be for obfuscation or clarity but are not inherently suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, importing multiple functions and variables from a local module. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of aliases is common and not suspicious. All reports agree on the benign nature of this code snippet, assigning malware scores of 0, with minor obfuscation scores (~0.1-0.2) due to aliasing. Security risk scores are very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign import operation. The trustworthiness of the imported module cannot be assessed here, but the import itself is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The minor aliasing does not indicate obfuscation or malicious activity. The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code is safe to use assuming the module itself is trustworthy.",
