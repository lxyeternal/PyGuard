  "purpose": "Import custom functions, scripts, and variables from a local module for further use in the application.",
  "sources": "Imports from the module '.pro.udfs_officejs', specifically the listed functions and variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed; code only performs import statements.",
  "flows": "Imported functions and variables could potentially be used elsewhere, but within this snippet, no data flow is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code patterns, or suspicious variables are present. The import of multiple functions and variables is standard for modular code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with specific functions and variables from a relative module. No input reading, no data transmission, nor execution of untrusted code is evident. The naming suggests these are related to office scripts or custom functions, but there is no evidence of malicious intent within this fragment. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement importing functions and variables for later use. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks within this isolated context.",
