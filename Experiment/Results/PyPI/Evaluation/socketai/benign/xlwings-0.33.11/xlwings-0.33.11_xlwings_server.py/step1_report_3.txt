  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from the module .pro.udfs_officejs for use within the larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from the relative module .pro.udfs_officejs",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output functions present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "All imported names appear to be standard function or variable names; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of multiple functions and variables from a relative module. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The imported names suggest functionality related to custom functions, scripting, and socket communication, but nothing inherently malicious. Since the code only handles imports, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no suspicious activity or malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase that utilizes these imported functions for its operations.",
