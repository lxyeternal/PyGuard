{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of abstract classes and interfaces for interacting with Excel-like objects and UI components, primarily intended for a library that manipulates Excel files and application windows.",
  "sources": "The code contains no explicit data input sources such as file reads, network calls, environment variables, or user input handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no data output sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications. No direct code execution or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are detectable; the code mainly consists of interface definitions with no implementation details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code consists solely of method signatures with NotImplementedError placeholders, indicating a framework or API skeleton.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstract class definitions for various Excel and application UI components, with no actual executable logic or data handling. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as system commands, data exfiltration, or network activity. The absence of implementation details limits the ability to analyze runtime behaviors, but based solely on these interfaces, there are no malicious signals or anomalies. The structure appears standard for a library intended for automation or plugin development, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of abstract classes serving as an API interface for Excel and application window manipulation. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code itself is a framework skeleton without implementations, making it unlikely to be malicious. The overall security risk is very low.",
