  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class and method definitions, with all methods raising `NotImplementedError`.\n- It appears to be a set of interface or abstract class definitions for an Excel automation or plugin framework.\n- There are no executable logic, data handling, network operations, or file I/O present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The code is purely structural, intended for extension and implementation elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines numerous abstract classes for spreadsheet and application objects.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: None; purely interface definitions.\n- Anomalies: No logic, no data, no suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Structural, non-executable, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no security threat.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar extensive interface definitions for Excel automation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Absent; no data or system interactions.\n- Anomalies: Standard interface declarations, no suspicious code.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior; part of a framework.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risk.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Interface definitions for Excel-like objects.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: None; purely declarative.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Framework skeleton, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no security concern.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Abstract classes for Excel automation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: None; no implementation.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Framework interface, no malicious signals.\n- Conclusion: Very low security risk.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Interface definitions for Excel automation.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: None; purely declarative.\n- Anomalies: No executable code or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Skeleton framework, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No security threat.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely structural, with no executable logic, data handling, or malicious patterns.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk is negligible, given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall risk score:** **0**  \n\nThis code is a set of interface definitions serving as a framework or API skeleton, with no malicious intent or security concerns evident in its current form.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The security of such code depends on the implementation of these interfaces. If later extended with malicious logic, risks could emerge. But based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
