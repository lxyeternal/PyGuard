{
  "purpose": "This code defines an extensive set of class interfaces for automating and manipulating Excel-like objects and operations, likely part of a larger automation or plugin system.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit sources of untrusted input or data reading functions. The code consists solely of class interface definitions with no implementation or data handling logic.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or functions handling external data or network communication. All methods are placeholders with 'raise NotImplementedError()'.",
  "flows": "There are no actual data flows or execution paths, as this code only declares class structures without executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code contains only class interfaces and placeholder methods with standard NotImplementedError exceptions.",
  "analysis": "This code is purely declarative, defining interfaces for interacting with Excel-like objects, including books, sheets, ranges, shapes, etc. It does not include any data handling, input/output, or external communication. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The structure indicates it is a framework or API definition intended to be implemented elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign framework of class interfaces for Excel automation, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard, non-executable template or API definition, posing no supply chain security threat.",
