{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of abstract classes and interfaces for automating and manipulating Excel-like applications and documents, including workbooks, sheets, ranges, charts, and other UI elements.",
  "sources": "There are no explicit data input sources like user input, network calls, or environment variable reads in the provided code. It mainly defines abstract interfaces without implementation details.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sink points such as network calls, file writes, or system commands. All methods raise NotImplementedError, and no concrete behavior or system interaction is implemented.",
  "flows": "There are no actual data or control flow paths present; the code only declares class interfaces without executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class and method declarations with no implementation, no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The comments and class structures appear to be standard interface definitions. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates that this code solely provides interface declarations for an Excel automation library. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or system modifications. The absence of executable code, data handling, or side effects suggests that there are no malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a part of a larger framework or SDK designed for automation or plugin development, with no inherent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of abstract class definitions and method signatures intended for Excel automation. There are no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks within these interface declarations. The code by itself is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
