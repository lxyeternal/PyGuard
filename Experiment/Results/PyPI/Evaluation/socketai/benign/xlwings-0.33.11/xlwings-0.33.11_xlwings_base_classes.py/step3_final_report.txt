{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of abstract classes and method signatures for automating and interacting with spreadsheet applications, workbooks, sheets, ranges, charts, and UI components. It serves as an interface or framework skeleton for extending functionality in Excel-like environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method calls and property accesses on class instances, but all methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError; no actual data input is performed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only interface definitions without implementation or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow exists in this code; it solely declares class structures and method signatures without executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. All methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating abstract definitions rather than executable code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class and method declarations serving as an API skeleton for Excel automation. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, network operations, or system modifications. The absence of executable code, data flows, or embedded secrets indicates a benign, structural framework. The code's purpose is to be extended with concrete implementations elsewhere, and it does not pose any security threat in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-executable framework or interface skeleton for Excel automation components. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores reflect the clear understanding that this is purely declarative, non-runtime code with no inherent security concerns.",
