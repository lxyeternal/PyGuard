  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class and method declarations with `NotImplementedError` placeholders.\n   - No executable logic, data handling, or system interactions are present.\n   - No signs of embedded malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code as interface definitions or API skeletons.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), reflecting a solid understanding that this is non-executable interface code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all code is purely declarative with no executable or malicious logic, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports appropriately assign zero or negligible scores for malware and security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity is suggested by the code.\n   - The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly noting that the code is just an interface framework.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature as interface definitions.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a set of abstract classes and method signatures, serving as a framework or API skeleton.\n- No executable logic, data flows, or system interactions are present.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detectable in this snippet.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, just to account for the potential of malicious implementation if someone later implements these interfaces maliciously, but as-is, it's negligible)\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code in its current form is benign, serving as a framework template with no inherent security threats.",
