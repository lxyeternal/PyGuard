  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Reads version string assigned to the variable '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to variables such as '__version__', 'version', and 'version_tuple'. No external untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded version string flows into variables, no external data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Contains no suspicious code, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version definition snippet generated by setuptools_scm. It conditionally defines version data types based on type checking, but ultimately assigns hardcoded version information. No input parsing, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely defining version variables for package metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
