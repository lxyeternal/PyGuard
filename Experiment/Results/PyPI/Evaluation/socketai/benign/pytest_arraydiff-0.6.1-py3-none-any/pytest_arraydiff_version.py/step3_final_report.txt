{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated version metadata file created by setuptools_scm, used for managing package version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it assigns static version strings and tuples, and uses a conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only assigns predefined static values.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies; it is a straightforward, auto-generated version info snippet with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version file with no dynamic behavior, external input, or network activity. It uses standard patterns for type hinting support and version assignment. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues. All reports correctly identify it as such, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications or further warnings are necessary.",
