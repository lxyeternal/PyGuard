{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and ensures version data is consistent across the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and tuple, based on predefined variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no external data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of version strings and tuples; no data flows from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING block for type hints is standard; no suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a version tuple type for type checking purposes, then assigns static version information. The version string and tuple are hardcoded and consistent. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no execution of untrusted code, and no malicious patterns. The structure is typical for version metadata in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version definition for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
