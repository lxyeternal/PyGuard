  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily used for version management.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuple, no external data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output points.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables based on static assignments, with conditional type checking imports. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. It appears to be a standard, boilerplate version definition file generated by a build tool. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard version metadata, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
