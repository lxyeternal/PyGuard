{
  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, and does not perform any runtime logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__' are assigned static values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all assignments are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a conditional block based on TYPE_CHECKING to import typing modules, which is standard for type hints. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward auto-generated version file, primarily defining static variables for versioning. It includes a typical conditional for type hinting compatibility. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely defining version metadata with no malicious intent or security risks.",
