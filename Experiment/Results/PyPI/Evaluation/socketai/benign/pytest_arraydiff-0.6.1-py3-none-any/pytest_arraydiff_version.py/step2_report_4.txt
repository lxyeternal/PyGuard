  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a typical auto-generated version file created by setuptools_scm.\n- It contains static version strings and tuples, with a conditional block for type hints.\n- There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard versioning info, generated by setuptools_scm.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also correctly notes the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly describes the code as straightforward, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Any necessary adjustments?**\n\n- Since the code is straightforward, static, auto-generated version info, no changes are needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Your own estimates:** Given the analysis, I agree with the current scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n- **Justification:** The code contains no malicious or obfuscated content, no external data handling, and is a standard versioning snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and free of security risks.",
