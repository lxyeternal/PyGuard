  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and compare them with the code:\n\n1. **Code Review and Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a standard, auto-generated version file created by setuptools_scm.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples, with a typical conditional for type hinting.\n   - No dynamic code, external input, or runtime logic exists.\n   - The code does not perform any I/O, network operations, or data processing.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and generated.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The detailed reasoning aligns well with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The code does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They reflect the benign, static, and auto-generated nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, auto-generated version metadata file with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
