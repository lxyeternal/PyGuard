  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a straightforward import statement with a license comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a license comment and a single import statement that imports a version string from a local module. There are no input handling, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious activities or obfuscated code. The import appears standard for Python packages to manage versioning. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version import with a license comment; it shows no malicious behavior or security issues.",
