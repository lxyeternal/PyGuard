  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a local module, likely for version management or package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.version)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static import of version information",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code, straightforward import, license comment present",
  "analysis": "The code contains a license comment and a single import statement for a version string from a local module. There are no user inputs, environment variable usages, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The import appears standard for Python packages to define the package version. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package version import with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
