  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .version import version as __version__`.\n   - The original code snippet matches this description exactly.\n   - There are no signs of malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or data leakage.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code based on these reports.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, benign import statement.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are sound; no corrections needed.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No score adjustments necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores for malware and security risk are 0, indicating no concern.\n   - The code is a simple import statement with a license comment, standard in many packages.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as standard practice.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is a typical version import with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- No further action required.\n\n**Overall, this is a benign code snippet with no security issues.**",
