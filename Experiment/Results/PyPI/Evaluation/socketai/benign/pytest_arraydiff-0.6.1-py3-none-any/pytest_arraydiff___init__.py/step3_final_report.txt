{
  "purpose": "Import the version string from a local module to define the package's __version__ variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information from the local module .version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "The source (imported version) is assigned directly to __version__, with no data flow beyond this assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with a license comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard practice in Python packages to include version info. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign intent. The import is from a local module, and the license comment is standard. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a common purpose of version management. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
