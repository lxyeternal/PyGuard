  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured serialization framework with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the dynamic class lookup via sys.modules, which could be exploited if malicious classes are injected, but this is not evidenced here. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are justified and appropriate."
