  "purpose": "Extend marshmallow's Boolean field to recognize additional string representations of true and false values.",
  "sources": "Import statements and internal updates to fields.Boolean.truthy and fields.Boolean.falsy sets.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution involved.",
  "flows": "Import from marshmallow and update of internal boolean value sets; no data flow outside the module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '# noqa' comments to suppress lint warnings; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign configuration changes by adding extra string values to the recognized true/false sets in marshmallow's Boolean fields. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The updates are straightforward and intended to improve data parsing flexibility. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minor security risk scores (0.1) assigned in some reports are conservative and reflect the potential for misinterpretation but are not indicative of actual threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward configuration update that extends boolean value recognition in marshmallow. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaw. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score should be set to 0 for accuracy. The overall assessment confirms the benign nature of this dependency modification.",
