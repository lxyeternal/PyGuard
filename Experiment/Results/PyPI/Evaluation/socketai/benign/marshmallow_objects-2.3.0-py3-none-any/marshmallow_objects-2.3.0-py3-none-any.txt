      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured serialization framework with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the dynamic class lookup via sys.modules, which could be exploited if malicious classes are injected, but this is not evidenced here. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are justified and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward configuration update that extends boolean value recognition in marshmallow. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaw. The assigned malware score is 0, and the security risk score should be set to 0 for accuracy. The overall assessment confirms the benign nature of this dependency modification."
