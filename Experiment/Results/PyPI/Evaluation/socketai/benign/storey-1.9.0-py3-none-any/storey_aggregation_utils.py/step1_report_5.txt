{
  "purpose": "This code defines and manages different types of data aggregation functions and their relationships, likely used in data analysis or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; the code relies on function arguments and predefined constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or external effects; primarily computations and mappings within the code.",
  "flows": "Function calls retrieve aggregate functions based on string inputs; no external data flows or untrusted data sources evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The use of bitwise operations for aggregate types is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of definitions, constants, and utility functions for managing aggregation types and computing certain statistical measures (mean, stddev, variance). It employs common practices such as mapping between names and bit flags, and providing utility functions for derived aggregates. There are no indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or harmful logic. The functions rely solely on mathematical calculations and predefined mappings, with no external interactions or insecure data handling. The structure appears standard for a data processing library component.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured utility module for aggregate type management and statistical calculations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use in a larger project context.",
