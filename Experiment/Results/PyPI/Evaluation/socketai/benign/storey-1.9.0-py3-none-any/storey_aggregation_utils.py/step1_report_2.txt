{
  "purpose": "This code defines and manages different types of data aggregation functions and their relationships, primarily for statistical computations.",
  "sources": "Constants and variables initialized at the beginning; functions that receive input parameters such as 'aggregate', 'args', and 'aggregates'.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical functions (_avg, _stddev, _stdvar) that process numeric data; get_virtual_aggregation_func and other functions that handle aggregate identifiers.",
  "flows": "Input identifiers or parameters like 'aggregate' and 'args' are processed through lookup functions, which determine corresponding functions or aggregate types, and mathematical functions compute statistical measures.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard statistical calculations; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. No data leakage, code injection, or insecure practices are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines aggregation type constants, mappings between aggregate names and bitmask representations, and functions for statistical calculations like average, standard deviation, and variance. It includes functions to determine if an aggregate is raw, implied, or supported. The functions are straightforward, with no external data handling, network operations, or suspicious logic. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a utility module for data aggregation within a larger system, with clear and standard implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of statistical aggregation logic without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not pose any security threat.",
