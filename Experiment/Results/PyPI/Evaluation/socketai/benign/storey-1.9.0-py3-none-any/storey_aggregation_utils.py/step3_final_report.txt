{
  "purpose": "Defines aggregation type constants, mappings, and statistical functions (mean, stddev, variance) for data analysis.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions that process in-memory data; no external data input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; purely computational with no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Function calls for statistical calculations based on input arguments; no external data flow or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides constants for aggregation types, mappings between names and bitwise flags, and functions for calculating mean, standard deviation, and variance. All functions are standard mathematical implementations with no external dependencies or data handling. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure is clear, and the logic is consistent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) align with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for statistical aggregation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
