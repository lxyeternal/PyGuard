{
  "purpose": "This code defines various aggregation types and functions to compute statistical aggregates like mean, standard deviation, and implied aggregations based on predefined constants and mappings.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions that rely on predefined aggregation type mappings and input parameters for aggregation names or arguments.",
  "sinks": "The functions that perform calculations (`_avg`, `_stddev`, `_stdvar`) process data but do not interact with external inputs or outputs directly. No untrusted data or external data sources are involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as aggregation names or argument lists flow into functions like `get_virtual_aggregation_func`, `get_implied_aggregates`, and `_avg`, `_stddev`, `_stdvar`, which perform calculations based on internal constants and mappings. No external data flows into or out of these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code is purely computational with clear, defined purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for aggregation types, functions to compute averages, standard deviation, and variance, and utility functions to map aggregation names to functions and implied aggregate types. It includes mappings between aggregation names and bitwise flags, and functions to interpret and derive aggregate types. The code appears standard for a statistical aggregation module without external interactions or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code is a straightforward implementation of statistical aggregate definitions and computations. No malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
