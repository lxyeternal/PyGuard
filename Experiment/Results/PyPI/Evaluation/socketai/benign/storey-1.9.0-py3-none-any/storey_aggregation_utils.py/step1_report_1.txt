{
  "purpose": "This code defines various aggregation types and functions to compute derived statistical metrics such as average, standard deviation, and variance. It provides utilities to handle aggregation names, implied aggregates, and mappings between aggregate types and names.",
  "sources": "Constants defining aggregation types, dictionaries mapping aggregate names to types, and functions that process these mappings.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code performs in-memory calculations and data mappings without external data flow.",
  "flows": "The functions convert aggregate names to types, compute derived metrics, and identify implied aggregates based on bitwise operations. No external input or output flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are detected. All operations are standard statistical calculations and data mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of constants, mappings, and straightforward functions to handle statistical aggregation types and derived calculations like mean, standard deviation, and variance. Functions like get_virtual_aggregation_func and get_implied_aggregates facilitate conversion and inference of aggregates based on bitwise logic. There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic. The code does not interact with external systems, files, or network resources, and it employs standard math library functions for computations. Overall, the code appears purely functional and focused on statistical processing with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling statistical aggregation types and computations. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The structure and purpose are aligned with legitimate data processing tasks, and there is no indication of malware or security risks.",
