  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code defines aggregation types, mappings, and functions for statistical calculations like mean, stddev, variance. It concludes that there's no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely computational, with constants, mappings, and functions for statistical calculations. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions for mean, stddev, and variance are standard and correctly implemented.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code manages aggregation types and performs standard statistical calculations. It also notes the absence of suspicious code or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic is straightforward, with clear mappings and mathematical functions. No external interactions or data leaks are evident.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the code's nature, this seems acceptable. The minor risk score might reflect a conservative stance, but there's no real security concern.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is described as defining aggregation types and functions for statistical metrics, with no external data handling or suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with no external dependencies or insecure practices. The code is a utility module.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0, correct.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's purpose as a utility for statistical aggregation, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's structure and functions are straightforward, with no external data interactions or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0, aligns with the code.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a utility for aggregate types and statistical calculations, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no obfuscated or malicious code. The use of bitwise operations for aggregate types is typical.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — a minimal risk score, possibly conservative.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. All functions are mathematical and data-mapping utilities.\n\n- **Scores Consistency:** The malware scores are all zero, which is justified. The minor security risk scores (0.1) are acceptable given the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:** No logical errors or flaws are evident. The code is well-structured and performs standard statistical calculations.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern could be the slight security risk score, but given the code's nature, this is likely a conservative default rather than an actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security concerns.\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0             |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe utility module for statistical aggregation with no malicious or security risk indicators.",
