  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate data pipeline components for serialization, storage, and streaming, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The security risk is low, primarily due to external network interactions, but no signs of malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
