  "purpose": "Event aggregation, feature enrichment, and periodic emission within a streaming data processing framework.",
  "sources": "Event objects' body, key, and timestamp extraction functions, external Table interactions for features and static attributes.",
  "sinks": "Emitted Event objects after feature augmentation, data stored in Table for aggregation.",
  "flows": "Event data flows from input Event objects through key and timestamp extraction, into Table for aggregation, then features are retrieved and augmented before emission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Use of dynamic functions and async workers is standard for such frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements event aggregation and querying classes with standard patterns, including async processing, feature retrieval, and periodic emission. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. External dependencies like Table and enrichment functions are outside this code's scope but are not inherently malicious. The code's structure is clear, and no obfuscation is evident. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging external dependencies could be malicious if compromised. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured event processing component typical of streaming analytics frameworks. No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent are evident. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero, and the low security risk score is appropriate given the code's benign nature.",
