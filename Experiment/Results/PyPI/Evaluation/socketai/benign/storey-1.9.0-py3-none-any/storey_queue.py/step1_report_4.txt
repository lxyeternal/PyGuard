{
  "purpose": "Provide asynchronous queue implementations with peek and timeout functionalities for concurrent Python applications.",
  "sources": "Reads include asyncio.get_running_loop(), collections.deque(), and the input parameters for methods such as put() and get().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the use of asyncio Futures and the manipulation of queue data, but no external data or untrusted sources are directly used or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (items to enqueue) flows into _deque via put(); peek accesses _queue[0]; get retrieves and removes items from _deque; timeouts are managed via loop.call_later().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external network connections are present. The code appears to implement standard asyncio queue patterns with added peek and timeout features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom queue classes: AsyncQueue and SimpleAsyncQueue. AsyncQueue adds a peek method and manages internal futures to wait for items; SimpleAsyncQueue provides basic get and put with timeout management via asyncio's event loop. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond asyncio constructs. The code uses standard Python libraries and common concurrency patterns without obfuscation or malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard asynchronous queue functionalities with additional features (peek and timeout). There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for async queue management.",
