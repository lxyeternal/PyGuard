{
  "purpose": "The code implements custom asynchronous queue classes for use with asyncio, providing enhanced features such as peeking and timeouts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from asyncio event loop functions, such as get_running_loop() and from method parameters like timeout.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks; it primarily manages internal queue data structures and future objects without transmitting untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data is enqueued via put() and retrieved via get(), with potential timeout handling; peek() accesses the queue head without removal, all within asyncio event loop contexts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of asyncio futures and queue manipulations are standard for asynchronous programming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom queue classes for asyncio: AsyncQueue with a peek method, and SimpleAsyncQueue with timeout support. Both classes use asyncio event loop features, futures, and collections to manage asynchronous data flows. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code snippets are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of asynchronous queue logic with additional utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom asyncio queues with added features for peeking and timeout handling. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility code for asynchronous queue management.",
