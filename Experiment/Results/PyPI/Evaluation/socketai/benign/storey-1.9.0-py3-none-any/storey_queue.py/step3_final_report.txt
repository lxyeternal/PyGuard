  "purpose": "Implementation of custom asyncio queue classes with peek and timeout features for asynchronous task management.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from internal queue structures (_queue, _deque) and asyncio futures.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; untrusted data could flow through queue operations but no malicious handling present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from queue insertions (put) to retrieval (get, peek), via internal deque or queue structures, using asyncio futures for synchronization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard asyncio constructs, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: AsyncQueue with a peek method, and SimpleAsyncQueue with timeout support, both utilizing standard asyncio primitives and collections. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious patterns are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and employs common concurrency patterns. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are present. Minor security risk scores in some reports reflect concurrency complexity but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of asyncio queues with additional features. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The security risk score can be conservatively set to 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities.",
