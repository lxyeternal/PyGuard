  "purpose": "Implementations of asynchronous queue classes with additional features such as peeking and timeout support.",
  "sources": "The code reads from asyncio event loop, collections deque, and creates futures for synchronization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external systems are present. The code primarily manages internal queue states.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through put() method into internal deque; get() method retrieves data; peek() method observes data without removal.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom async queue classes extending asyncio.Queue and implementing additional features such as peek and timeout support. It uses standard asyncio constructs and collections for queue management. No external data sources, no data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. The use of asyncio for concurrency is typical, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious injections. The functions perform expected queue operations, with appropriate exception handling and timeout mechanisms. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility for async queue management.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard async queue functionality with additional features like peeking and timeout. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The implementation appears safe and benign.",
