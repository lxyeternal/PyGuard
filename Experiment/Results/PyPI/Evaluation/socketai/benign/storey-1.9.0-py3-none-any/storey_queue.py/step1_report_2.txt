  "purpose": "Implementation of asynchronous queue classes with additional functionalities like peeking and timeout handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from asyncio queues, collections deque, and the asyncio event loop.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; data flows are internal queue operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into queue methods (put/get), with internal management of futures and dequeues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation. The peek method and timeout handling are standard asyncio patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom asyncio queue classes: AsyncQueue with a peek method, and SimpleAsyncQueue with timeout support. Both utilize asyncio futures and collections for concurrency control. The peek method adds a way to look at the next item without removal. Timeout handling in get is via scheduled future cancellation. No external data inputs, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is detected. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoors present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of async queues with enhanced features.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides extended queue functionalities for asyncio applications without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal, well-structured async queue implementation.",
