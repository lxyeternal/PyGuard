  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard open-source SQL driver with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The primary security consideration is ensuring external inputs are validated to prevent injection, but the code's use of ORM reduces this risk. Scores are consistent with this assessment."
