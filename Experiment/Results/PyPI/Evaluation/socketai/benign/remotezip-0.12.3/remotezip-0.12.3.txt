      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate remote ZIP handling utility with no malicious or obfuscated components. The main security concern is the potential misuse when handling untrusted ZIP files, which is a general risk rather than a flaw in the code. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 to 0.3 accurately reflects the inherent risk of processing untrusted archives without validation. No modifications are necessary."
