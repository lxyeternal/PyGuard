  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'remotezip' Python package, used to package and distribute the software.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; no execution of external code or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> assigns description; setup parameters are static and do not process external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a local README file for the long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, no handling of untrusted input, and no indications of malicious activity or sabotage. The code adheres to typical packaging conventions and contains no hidden or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves its purpose of configuring package installation securely.",
