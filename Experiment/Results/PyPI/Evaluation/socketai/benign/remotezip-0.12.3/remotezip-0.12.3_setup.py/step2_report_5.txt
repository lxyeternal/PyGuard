  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- Dependencies are specified explicitly ('requests', 'requests_mock' for testing).\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations are present within the setup script.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code patterns are detected.\n- The setup script appears to be a legitimate, well-formed configuration for the 'remotezip' package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description in all reports: a typical setup.py for a Python package.\n- No issues or anomalies are present in the code itself.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Security risk score is 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely a static setup script with no dynamic or external code execution, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made that would warrant higher scores.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is standard, with no hidden or suspicious behavior.\n- The only potential concern could be dependencies, but 'requests' and 'requests_mock' are common and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup.py code is benign and correctly assessed by all reports. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
