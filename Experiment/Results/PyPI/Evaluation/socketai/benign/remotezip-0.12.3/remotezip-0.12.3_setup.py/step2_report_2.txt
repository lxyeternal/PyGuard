  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations are present.\n- The script only reads a local README file and sets package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors are detected.\n- Dependencies are standard and appropriate for a setup script.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no malicious activity. Given the code's nature, this is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any risky behavior.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n- No issues are identified; the code is straightforward and conventional.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n- The dependencies are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n- The process of reading the README.md file is safe and typical.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The provided setup.py code is a legitimate, well-formed package configuration script.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and accurate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the thorough assessments provided.",
