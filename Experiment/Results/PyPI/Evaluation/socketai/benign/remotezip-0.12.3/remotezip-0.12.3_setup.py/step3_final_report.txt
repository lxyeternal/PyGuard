  "purpose": "Package configuration for 'remotezip' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for description.",
  "sinks": "None.",
  "flows": "Static data from local files to package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads a local README file and sets up the package without any dynamic code, network activity, or user input handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. All dependencies are standard, and the code structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature.",
