  "purpose": "Define type aliases and type hints for configuration settings, distributions, file paths, and subprocess execution in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for os, sys, and typing; type annotations for ConfigSettings, Distribution, StrPath, and SubprocessRunner.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no execution of external commands or data processing beyond type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; type annotations are static and do not involve runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional type alias definitions based on Python version and type checking context, which are standard for compatibility. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type aliases and conditional type hints for compatibility across different Python versions. It includes imports, type annotations, and conditional imports or type definitions based on version and type checking context. There are no data inputs, network operations, file manipulations, or execution commands that could be malicious. The structure is typical for a Python module meant to provide type hints and compatibility layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious setup for type annotations and compatibility. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
