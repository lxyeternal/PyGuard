  "purpose": "Define type aliases and conditional imports for Python version compatibility and type checking.",
  "sources": "Standard modules os, sys, typing; conditional import from pyproject_hooks during type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external commands or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only sets up type aliases and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of 'SubprocessRunner' from 'pyproject_hooks' during type checking; no runtime execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for type annotations, with conditional definitions based on Python version and type checking context. It imports standard modules and defines type aliases without any data handling, external communication, or malicious constructs. The conditional import from 'pyproject_hooks' is a common pattern for type hints and does not execute at runtime, posing no security risk. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for type annotations and compatibility handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly cautious but justified given the conditional import, which does not pose an actual threat.",
