  "purpose": "Define type aliases and imports for a Python package related to configuration, distribution, path handling, and subprocess running.",
  "sources": "Import statements from os, sys, and typing modules; conditional type alias assignments based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets type aliases and imports without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard import and type alias definitions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations and conditional imports depending on Python version and type checking context. No data input handling or external communications occur. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign module defining types and imports for package structure. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risk.",
