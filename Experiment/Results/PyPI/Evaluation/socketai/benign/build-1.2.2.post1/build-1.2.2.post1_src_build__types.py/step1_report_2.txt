{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and import future features for type annotations, as well as conditional type definitions based on Python version and type checking.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (sys.version_info), environment (os), and type hints. It also imports from pyproject_hooks during type checking.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; the code primarily defines types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The conditional type aliasing based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and typing modules, defines type aliases, and conditionally sets types based on Python version and type checking context. There is a benign import of 'SubprocessRunner' from 'pyproject_hooks' only during type checking, which does not execute at runtime. All constructs are standard and intended for type annotations. No suspicious or malicious code, data leaks, or hidden behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe setup for type annotations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily enhances code clarity and type safety without performing any runtime actions that could be malicious.",
