  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily setting up type aliases, conditional imports, and type annotations.\n- No report identifies any data flow from untrusted sources, network activity, or runtime code execution.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The only notable aspect is the conditional import of `SubprocessRunner` from `pyproject_hooks` during type checking, which is standard practice in modular Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code is straightforward and does not contain any bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious code. All reports correctly conclude this.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical or implementation errors are identified. The conditional type aliasing based on Python version and type checking is standard and correct.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is present, a malware score of 0 is appropriate across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  No obfuscation is present; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Given the code only defines types and imports, with no data handling or external commands, a low risk score (0 or 0.1) is reasonable. Some reports assign 0.1, which is acceptable considering the conditional import might slightly complicate understanding but does not pose a real risk.\n\n- **Any assumptions or claims?**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:**  \n  The assigned scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No changes needed.\n\n- **Risk justification:**  \n  The minimal risk score (0.1) in some reports is acceptable due to the conditional import, but it does not indicate any real security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (acceptable, given the conditional import, but not indicative of actual risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign setup for type annotations and compatibility handling in a Python project. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
