  "purpose": "Define type aliases and imports for a Python project, including configuration, distribution types, and subprocess execution.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; imports from os, sys, typing, and conditional import from pyproject_hooks.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only type annotations and conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional type aliasing based on Python version and type checking, which is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases and conditional imports for type checking and compatibility across Python versions. There are no functions executing commands, network connections, or data handling that could be exploited. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical type annotation and import setup for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
