{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and type annotations for a Python project, including configuration settings, distribution types, path types, and a subprocess runner callable.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are 'sys.version_info' for version checking, and external modules like 'os', 'sys', and 'pyproject_hooks'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or harmful effects; the code mainly defines types and imports.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, performing version checks, and defining type aliases and conditional imports, with no untrusted data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present; code uses standard Python features for type annotations and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type alias and import setup for a Python project, utilizing standard modules and conditional logic based on Python version. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. It does not include any dynamic code execution or network interactions. The only potential concern is the conditional import from 'pyproject_hooks', which is typical for modular project setups, not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup for type annotations and conditional imports in a Python package. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
