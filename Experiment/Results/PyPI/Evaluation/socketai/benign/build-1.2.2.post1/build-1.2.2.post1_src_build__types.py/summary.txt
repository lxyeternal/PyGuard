  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for type annotations and compatibility handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly cautious but justified given the conditional import, which does not pose an actual threat."
