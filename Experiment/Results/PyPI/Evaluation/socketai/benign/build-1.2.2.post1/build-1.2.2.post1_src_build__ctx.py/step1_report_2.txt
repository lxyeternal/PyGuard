  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for logging and running subprocesses with optional verbose output, using context variables for logging configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from __spec__, uses subprocess module to execute commands, reads environment variables (env), reads context variables (LOGGER, VERBOSITY), reads input commands (cmd).",
  "sinks": "Logs messages via LOGGER, potentially decodes and logs subprocess stdout/stderr streams, executes system commands.",
  "flows": "Input commands from run_subprocess → subprocess.Popen / subprocess.run → logs via LOGGER → outputs to stdout/stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of subprocess with command lists is standard; no suspicious command injections observed. No obfuscated code. Use of context variables is safe. No untrusted input sources other than passed commands. Logging and subprocess execution are handled securely. No malicious backdoors or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured logging and subprocess execution functions with configurable verbosity. It uses context variables for flexible logging behavior. The subprocess execution properly captures output, and errors are logged in detail. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious command executions. No indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. All code appears standard for process management and logging utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard logging and subprocess utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It manages subprocess execution and logging in a controlled manner without risky behavior. No security risks are evident in this module.",
