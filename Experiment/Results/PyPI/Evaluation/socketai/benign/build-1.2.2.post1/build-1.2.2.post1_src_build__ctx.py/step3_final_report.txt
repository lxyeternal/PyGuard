  "purpose": "Provides subprocess execution and logging utilities with context-aware logging and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads command inputs from the 'cmd' parameter, captures subprocess stdout and stderr streams, and reads environment variables if provided.",
  "sinks": "Logs command lines, stdout, stderr, and error details which could potentially expose sensitive data if logs are not secured.",
  "flows": "Source: subprocess command and environment variables -> Sink: logging command line and output streams.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __spec__ for package name, dynamic attribute access (__getattr__), and logging subprocess outputs which could leak sensitive info if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard subprocess management and logging utility. It handles subprocess execution with optional verbose logging, captures and logs stdout/stderr, and manages errors. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The use of context variables for logger and verbosity is typical. Logging subprocess outputs could expose sensitive data, but this is a common debugging practice. No malicious patterns or backdoors are detected. The code structure and behavior align with benign process management utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured subprocess execution and logging utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The potential risk lies in logging sensitive data, but this is typical for debugging purposes. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but present concerns about data exposure in logs.",
