{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a front-end CLI tool for building Python packages, supporting source distributions (sdist) and wheel distributions, with options for isolated or non-isolated environments, configuration settings, and output management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command-line arguments, environment variables (NO_COLOR, FORCE_COLOR), and external modules such as sys.stdout, os.environ, and argparse inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess calls, environment variable modifications, and printing to stdout/stderr, especially in warnings and error reporting functions.",
  "flows": "Input flows from CLI arguments or environment variables into control flow, determining build actions. Data from user inputs or environment variables influences environment setup and build commands. Error handling captures exceptions and outputs logs or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. Use of standard libraries and predictable environment manipulations. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI front-end for a build system, handling user inputs, environment configuration, and invoking build routines. It includes environment setup, color and logging configurations, error handling, and subprocess management. The functions perform standard build operations with proper exception handling. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system damage, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. All external interactions are related to standard build processes and environment setup. No suspicious network activity or code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a legitimate build frontend, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages user input, environment configuration, and error handling without introducing security vulnerabilities or malware behaviors.",
