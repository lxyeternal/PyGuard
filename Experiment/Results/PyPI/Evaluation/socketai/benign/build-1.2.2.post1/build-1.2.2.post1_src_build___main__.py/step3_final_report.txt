  "purpose": "A CLI tool for building Python packages, supporting sdist and wheel distributions, managing environment setup, CLI args, and logging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., NO_COLOR, FORCE_COLOR), CLI arguments, filesystem paths, subprocess calls within build modules.",
  "sinks": "Build subprocesses encapsulated in external modules, environment variable outputs, error messages, filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "CLI args and environment variables influence build configuration; subprocess calls execute build commands within controlled modules; no direct untrusted command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. External subprocess calls are standard for build tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured Python build frontend that manages build environments, handles CLI options, and logs progress. It encapsulates subprocess calls within build modules, avoiding direct execution of untrusted input. Error handling is thorough, environment variables are used for configuration and output formatting, and no malicious behaviors or obfuscation are present. The subprocess usage and environment handling are typical for such tools, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe Python package build frontend with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are accurate and justified based on the code's characteristics and behavior.",
