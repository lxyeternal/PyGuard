  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a build frontend for Python packages, reading environment variables, CLI args, filesystem paths.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct execution of untrusted input; subprocess usage is encapsulated within build routines.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The subprocess calls are part of standard build processes.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate build tool, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. No malicious activity detected. The subprocess calls are controlled and part of the build process.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard CLI for building packages.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially risky outputs (warnings, errors), but no untrusted code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, with high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no malicious indicators. The environment handling and subprocess usage are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build frontend, managing dependencies, environment setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External subprocesses for build, filesystem extraction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Normal build process, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The subprocesses are part of the build, not malicious injections.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** CLI for building packages, environment management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External subprocesses, file operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build frontend, standard environment and CLI handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Build subprocesses encapsulated, no external malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and the code analysis supports this. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, with no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard build process risks, but nothing alarming.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — typical build tool risk, not elevated.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard Python package build frontend. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The environment variable handling, subprocess encapsulation, and error management are all typical for such tools. The scores given are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' conclusions and supports the view that the code is safe and intended for legitimate use.",
