  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports identify that the code is solely class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to a build system.\n- No external data sources, user input, network activity, or data processing are present.\n- The code imports 'subprocess' but only uses it in type annotations within the FailedProcessError class; no subprocess calls are made.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code appears standard, straightforward, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The code is syntactically correct and logically sound for its purpose.\n- **Potential improvements?**  \n  Minor: The use of 'super().__init__()' without arguments in some classes could be clarified, but this isn't a security concern.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All assign 0 or 0.5. Since there's no malicious behavior, 0 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; the code is benign.\n\n### Challenge assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- No suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are assumed or implied beyond the code's scope.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The code is safe, with no security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for build error handling. It poses no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
