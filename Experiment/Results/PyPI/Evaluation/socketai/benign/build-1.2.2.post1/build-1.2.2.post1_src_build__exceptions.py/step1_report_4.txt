  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for build system errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; only class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python exception and warning class definitions, used for handling build process errors. It imports subprocess and types modules but does not execute any commands or handle untrusted input. No code injection, external data reading, or malicious activity is present. The classes are straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or malicious logic. The code appears to be part of a larger build system but on its own is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe, consisting of exception class definitions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
