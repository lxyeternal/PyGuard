  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to a build system.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or code execution occurs.\n- The code imports 'subprocess' but only uses it in type annotations within the `FailedProcessError` class; no subprocess calls are made.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code appears to be standard, clean, and safe.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n- The security risk score is 0, given the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.\n- The confidence level is high (1), indicating strong agreement across reports.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The use of 'subprocess' only in type annotations is harmless but somewhat unnecessary; however, it does not impact security.\n- No claims or evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscation are present.\n- The purpose of the code is purely to define exception classes, which is standard practice.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.",
