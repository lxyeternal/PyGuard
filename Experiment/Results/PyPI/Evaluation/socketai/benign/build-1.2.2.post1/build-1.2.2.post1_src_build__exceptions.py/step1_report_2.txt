  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for build system error handling and warnings.",
  "sources": "None (all code consists of class definitions and imports).",
  "sinks": "None (no data flow or external data handling present).",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows as no data processing or external input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. Exception classes are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception and warning classes, primarily for build process error handling. It imports subprocess, but only uses it in a class that captures exceptions from subprocess calls, which is typical. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The structure is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of exception class definitions for build system error handling. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
