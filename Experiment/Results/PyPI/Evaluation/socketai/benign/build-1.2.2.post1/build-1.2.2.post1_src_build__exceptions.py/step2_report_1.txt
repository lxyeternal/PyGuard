  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the reasoning.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to a build system.\n- The code imports `subprocess` but does not use it except in type annotations, which is typical and not suspicious.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is straightforward and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are present in the logic or structure.\n- The code serves as a typical set of exception classes.\n\n**2. Reasoning and scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), justified by the clear, standard nature of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with no obfuscation detected.\n- The malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity.\n\n**3. Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely class definitions.\n- The reports do not suggest any suspicious behavior or hidden malicious intent.\n\n**4. Consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n- The reasoning is sound across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception and warning class definitions for a build system. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores given are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes are necessary.",
