  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and scoring justification.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to a build system.\n- It imports 'subprocess' and 'types' but only uses 'subprocess' in type annotations, not in runtime code.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly to structure error handling in a build process.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issue Presence\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that there are no security, malware, or obfuscation issues in the code.\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct and follows standard patterns for exception classes.\n\n### Logical Flaws & Reasoning\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports’ reasoning. They consistently conclude the code is benign and straightforward.\n\n### Scoring Analysis\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores\n- Since the code is purely class definitions for error handling, with no external interactions or data processing, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- All reports assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Consistency & Recommendations\n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard set of exception and warning class definitions. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors. The presence of 'subprocess' in imports is only for type annotations and does not pose any threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
