  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for build process errors and warnings in a Python build system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to a build system, with no external input handling, data processing, or network operations. It imports 'subprocess' but does not utilize it except in type annotations. There are no code injection, backdoors, or malicious constructs present. The structure and content are straightforward and aligned with standard exception class patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception and warning class definitions for build process error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
