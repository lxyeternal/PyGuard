  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for build system error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; imports 'subprocess' and 'types' for type annotations only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and exception raising; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard class definitions, 'subprocess' used only in type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and warnings related to a build system. It imports 'subprocess' but does not execute subprocesses; only uses it in type annotations. No external input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, syntactically correct, and serves as a typical pattern for error handling. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
