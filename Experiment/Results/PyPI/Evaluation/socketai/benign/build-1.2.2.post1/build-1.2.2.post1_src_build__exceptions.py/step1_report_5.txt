  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for build process errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple custom exception and warning classes for build-related errors, such as BuildException, BuildBackendException, BuildSystemTableValidationError, and FailedProcessError, as well as a warning class TypoWarning. These classes are used for error handling and do not perform any data processing, network communication, or file manipulation. The constructors and methods are standard, with no evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No external input handling, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to structure error handling in a build system context without any indication of sabotage or malware.",
