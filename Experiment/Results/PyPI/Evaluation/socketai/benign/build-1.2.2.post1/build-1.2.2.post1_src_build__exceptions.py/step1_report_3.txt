  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes used in build and process workflows for a Python project.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user input reads are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output to external systems are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. Exception classes are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception and warning class definitions, with no external input handling or dangerous operations. The classes include BuildException, BuildBackendException, BuildSystemTableValidationError, FailedProcessError, and TypoWarning, all of which are standard and used for error reporting. No malicious code, hidden behaviors, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in build processes. It does not contain any malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
