      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only minor note is the import of 'build', which is typical in many projects for version management. Therefore, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk can be confidently set to 0. The existing reports are accurate; the slight concern about the import does not translate into actual risk."

The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly cautious but justified given the conditional import, which does not pose an actual threat."
