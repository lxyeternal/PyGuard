{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for creating and managing isolated Python environments, installing dependencies, and handling environment detection and setup.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations (temp directories, checking for executables), subprocess calls for environment creation and package installation, environment variable modifications.",
  "sinks": "Potential command execution via subprocess, filesystem modifications, environment variable changes, but all within controlled internal variables.",
  "flows": "Code reads environment info and system details (sources), constructs subprocess commands for environment setup and package installation (flows), executes these commands (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for creating isolated Python environments using virtualenv, venv, or uv, with dependency checks and package installation. It uses subprocesses for environment setup and package management, with proper cleanup and error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are detected. The subprocess commands are constructed from internal variables and system info, reducing risk of injection. Dependency checks and environment detection are performed securely. Overall, the code aligns with best practices for environment management and does not exhibit any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for creating and managing isolated Python environments. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
