  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- It imports a module named `build` and uses `build.__version__` for versioning.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The import of `build` could be local or third-party, but no suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard configuration setup.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; relies on `build.__version__`.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** Import of `build`, usage of `build.__version__`.\n- **Analysis:** No external data, no malicious behavior, only a standard pattern.\n- **Concerns:** Slight mention that importing `build` assumes it's safe.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to reliance on external module)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. The slight concern about trusting `build` is noted, but no actual security issue.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Same as above, consistent with previous assessments.\n- No suspicious code, no external network activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Same pattern, standard configuration.\n- No untrusted data, no suspicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Similar findings, notes the unusual import but no malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to the unusual import.\n- No malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a typical configuration script.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero in all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 to 0.1 (very low, mostly due to reliance on an external module, which is common in such configs).\n\n**Final note:** The import of `build` is standard in many projects to dynamically fetch version info. While it's always good to verify the origin of such modules, nothing in this code indicates malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their assessments. The code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no malware or security risks detected.",
