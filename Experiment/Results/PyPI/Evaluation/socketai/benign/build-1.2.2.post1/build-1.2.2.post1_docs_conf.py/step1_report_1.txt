  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, paths, and themes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'build' module, assignment of 'version' and 'release' from 'build.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious output identified.",
  "flows": "Import 'build' -> retrieve 'build.__version__' -> assign to 'version' and 'release'.",
  "anomalies": "Importing 'build' without clear context; 'build' could be a custom or third-party module. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration variables for Sphinx documentation, including project info, extensions, and themes. The import of 'build' is standard, assuming 'build' is a local or properly installed module. The version variables derive from 'build.__version__', which is typical for dynamic versioning. No indications of malicious behavior such as data leaks, network activity, or sabotage are present. The code does not handle untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems beyond static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. It relies on a 'build' module for versioning but contains no active security risks or malware indicators.",
