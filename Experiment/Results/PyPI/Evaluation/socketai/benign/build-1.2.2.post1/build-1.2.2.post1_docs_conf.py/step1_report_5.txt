  "sources": "Import statement for 'build' module, usage of 'build.__version__' to set version and release",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or external data output functions",
  "flows": "build.__version__ is read from the 'build' module and used in setting project version info",
  "anomalies": "Importing a module named 'build' and using its '__version__' attribute is unusual without context; no explicit malicious indicators, but the module import is noteworthy",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'build' module and uses its '__version__' attribute for versioning. There are no suspicious code patterns, no external data flows, and no code execution based on untrusted input. The import may be from a local or external package, but without further context, it is standard for version retrieval. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Sphinx configuration file with an unconventional import of a 'build' module for version info. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this code fragment.",
