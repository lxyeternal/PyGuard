  "purpose": "Configuration setup for generating documentation using Sphinx for the 'build' project.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'build' module, usage of 'build.__version__' for version info.",
  "sinks": "None identified—no data flows to external systems or outputs based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The version info from 'build.__version__' is used in the html_title setting, but this is a static configuration value, not user input.",
  "anomalies": "Importing 'build' module without validation; usage of module attribute '__version__' assumes safe and intended usage; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'build' and uses its '__version__' attribute to set version information. This is standard practice for dynamic versioning in documentation configurations. There are no external data sources or inputs that could be exploited. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The module import is straightforward, and the rest of the configuration is typical for Sphinx setup. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The only point of concern might be the assumption that 'build' is a trusted, safe module, but that falls within normal project context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Sphinx configuration file with standard usage. No malicious behavior or security threats are detected.",
