  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import build', reading version information from build.__version__.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Build version is obtained from build.__version__, used for project info and html_title.",
  "anomalies": "Importing a module named 'build' that may be part of the project; no explicit malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file. It imports the 'build' module to fetch version info, sets project details, extensions, themes, and other documentation options. No untrusted data sources, no dangerous data flows, and no suspicious code patterns observed. The only potential concern is the import of 'build', which is expected to be a local module or package, not external or malicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
