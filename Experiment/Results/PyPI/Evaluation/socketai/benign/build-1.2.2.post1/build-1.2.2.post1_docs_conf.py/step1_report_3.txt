  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, themes, and other settings.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'build' module, reads configuration variables, extension lists, and theme settings.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported 'build' module to use in version/release variables, and from configuration settings to Sphinx build process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The import of 'build' could be benign or a placeholder; no malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file setting up project info, extensions, themes, and other build options. It imports a local module 'build' to retrieve version info, which is a common pattern. No user input, network activity, or data leakage points are present. No suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic, are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical and benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
