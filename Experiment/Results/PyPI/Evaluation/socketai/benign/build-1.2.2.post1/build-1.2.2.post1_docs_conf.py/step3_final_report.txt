  "purpose": "Standard Sphinx configuration file that imports a build module to retrieve version information for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import of the 'build' module and usage of 'build.__version__' for versioning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Import of 'build' -> access to 'build.__version__' for version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Importing 'build' without context is slightly unusual but common in projects for dynamic versioning; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It imports a module named 'build' to dynamically set the project version, which is a common pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. The import of 'build' could be local or third-party, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The only minor note is the import of 'build', which is typical in many projects for version management. Therefore, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk can be confidently set to 0. The existing reports are accurate; the slight concern about the import does not translate into actual risk.",
