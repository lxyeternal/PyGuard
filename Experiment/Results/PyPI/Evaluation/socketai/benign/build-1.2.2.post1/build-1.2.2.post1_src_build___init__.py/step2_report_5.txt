  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward Python module for a build frontend, with imports, versioning, and an explicit `__all__` list.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution that could be suspicious.\n   - Based on the code snippet, there are no vulnerabilities or malicious indicators.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports are empty responses with \"Empty response\" errors.\n   - This suggests either:\n     - The reports were not generated or transmitted correctly.\n     - There was a failure in the reporting system.\n     - No issues were identified or the reporting process failed to capture any data.\n   - Since the reports contain no content, they do not provide any basis for analysis or validation.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Without specific scores provided, I cannot evaluate their reasonableness.\n   - Given the lack of information, any scores assigned would be speculative.\n   - If scores are assigned, they should reflect the absence of any detected issues—probably very low (close to 0).\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - There is no evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious intent.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should be minimal, near zero.\n   - Assigning high risk scores without evidence would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - The code is benign; no malicious behavior is evident.\n   - Malware score should be zero or very close to zero.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Since reports are empty, there are no claims to evaluate or challenge.\n   - Any assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware would be unfounded.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - No scores are provided, but based on the analysis, they should be minimal.\n   - If any scores are higher, they are likely inconsistent with the actual code.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Code Review:** No issues detected; the code appears correct and benign.\n- **Reports:** Empty, no data to analyze.\n- **Scores:** Should be near zero for malware, obfuscated code, and overall risk.\n- **Overall Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports do not indicate any problems. Any higher scores would be unjustified without evidence.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Note:** It is crucial to obtain detailed reports for a thorough review. The current data does not suggest any concerns.",
