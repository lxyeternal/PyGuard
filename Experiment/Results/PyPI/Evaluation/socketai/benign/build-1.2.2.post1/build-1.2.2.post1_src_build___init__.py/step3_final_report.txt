{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main module for a Python build frontend, defining version info, public API components, and a directory listing function.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from module-level variables and imports internal modules and types.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; the code does not perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module defining version info, import statements, and an API list. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or malicious patterns are evident. The reports provided are empty, indicating no issues or findings. Given the benign nature of the code and lack of evidence, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The empty reports do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Therefore, the security scores should be set to zero, reflecting no known issues.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
