{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a PEP 517 build system interface, managing configuration parsing, dependency validation, backend invocation, and metadata handling for Python package builds.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', and wheel files; invokes backend hooks via subprocess wrapper; accesses filesystem for directories and files.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to build backends, file extraction from wheel archives, directory creation and validation.",
  "flows": "Configuration files → subprocess calls to backend hooks → wheel extraction and file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious external activity detected. Subprocess calls are encapsulated and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard practices for Python build systems, utilizing controlled subprocess invocation, configuration validation, and file handling. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or unauthorized network activity are present. Subprocess usage depends on a runner that defaults to safe behavior. Error handling is appropriate, and the code structure is clear and readable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a Python build system interface with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
