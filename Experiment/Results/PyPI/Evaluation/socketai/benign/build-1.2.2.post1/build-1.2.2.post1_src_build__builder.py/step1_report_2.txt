{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python API for building packages according to PEP 517, managing dependencies, and invoking build backends within a project directory.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files (pyproject.toml, setup.py), environment variables, function arguments, and subprocess calls via the runner.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes subprocesses via the provided runner, interacts with the filesystem for directory creation and file extraction, and reads project configuration files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading configuration files and user input, through dependency checks and validation, into subprocess invocation for build backend processes, and file operations for metadata extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious backdoors detected. Use of subprocess is controlled via the runner; however, subprocess calls could be misused if the runner is replaced maliciously. No obfuscated code patterns observed. No network connections or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration validation, dependency management, and invokes build backends via subprocesses, all within controlled environments. It reads project configuration files and manages build directories safely. The subprocess invocation is wrapped with a function that can be customized, minimizing risk of arbitrary command execution. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears standard for a build tool with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical project build management module with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It uses subprocess calls in a controlled manner, with proper validation and exception handling. Overall security risk is low.",
