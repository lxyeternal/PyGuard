  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the reported issues against the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Recognizes standard build system patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malware detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in the assessment.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion matches the code's behavior. The code uses standard practices, and no malicious activity is evident. The subprocess runner is used in a controlled manner, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity, with caution about subprocess usage if the runner is compromised.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware signs.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still low; reflects awareness that subprocess calls could be risky if the runner is malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis correctly notes that subprocess calls are controlled via the runner, which defaults to safe behavior. The code does not contain any malicious logic. The risk score is reasonable, considering external runner trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizes safe subprocess invocation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with controlled subprocess usage.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code's behavior aligns with the report. The subprocess calls are wrapped and validated, and no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar positive assessment, no malicious activity, standard build operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware signs.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, considering safe defaults.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis matches the code's behavior. The subprocess invocation is controlled, and no suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion — no malicious behavior, standard build process.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering subprocess usage.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No hidden malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, legitimate build system implementation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The subprocess calls are wrapped and controlled, with no evidence of abuse.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, low risk) are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the controlled subprocess invocation and standard practices, a low risk score (~0.1–0.2) is appropriate. The highest assigned is 0.2, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very low, considering the controlled subprocess calls and standard implementation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured Python build system interface, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
