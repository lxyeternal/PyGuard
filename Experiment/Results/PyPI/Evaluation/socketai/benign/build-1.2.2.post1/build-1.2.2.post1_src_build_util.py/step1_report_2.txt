{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a build or packaging utility that retrieves wheel metadata for a Python project, supporting isolated and non-isolated environments.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'source_dir' parameter for the project directory, environment context managers (DefaultIsolatedEnv), and optional runner parameter for subprocess execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve subprocess execution via 'runner', environment installation commands (env.install), and file system interactions for temporary directories and path manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input source 'source_dir' is used to initialize ProjectBuilder; in isolated mode, environment setup and package installation occur; finally, metadata extraction occurs through '_project_wheel_metadata'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The subprocess runner is parameterized, reducing risk of command injection. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to retrieve package metadata by building a project in either an isolated or current environment. It uses context managers for temporary directories and environment setup, invoking build steps and metadata extraction. Usage of 'importlib.metadata' is standard for Python package metadata. The subprocess runner is passed as a parameter, which can be controlled externally, preventing hardcoded commands. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic aligns with typical packaging workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for obtaining Python package wheel metadata, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It operates within normal parameters for build tooling, with no suspicious code patterns or security risks identified.",
