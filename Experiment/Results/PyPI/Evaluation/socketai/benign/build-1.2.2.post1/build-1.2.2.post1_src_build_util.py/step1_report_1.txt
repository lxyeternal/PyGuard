{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to retrieve wheel metadata for a Python project, optionally using an isolated environment.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.PathDistribution for metadata extraction, tempfile.TemporaryDirectory for temporary workspace, environment context managed by DefaultIsolatedEnv, ProjectBuilder instantiation, and environment installation of dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources are directly used as sinks; data is used for metadata extraction and environment setup.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependencies are read from the project directory, used to build the environment, and metadata is extracted via PathDistribution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual code constructs. Usage of temporary directories and environment management appears standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages project build metadata retrieval with optional isolation. It utilizes standard library features and common dependency management practices. No external data inputs are directly exploited in a malicious manner. All functions and modules invoked are open-source and standard for Python packaging workflows. No signs of malicious backdoors or covert data leaks. The code structure and flow are straightforward and adhere to expected packaging processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a build or packaging tool, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It securely manages environment setup and metadata extraction using standard practices.",
