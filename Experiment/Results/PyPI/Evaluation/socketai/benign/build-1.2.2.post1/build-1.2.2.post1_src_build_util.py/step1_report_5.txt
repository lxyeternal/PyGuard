{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality to retrieve wheel metadata for a Python project, either in an isolated environment or within the current environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem (project source directory, temporary directories), environment variables (via env context manager), and subprocesses (via runner).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data influences environment setup or subprocess execution; however, the subprocess runner is parameterized and controlled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source_dir and environment setup into ProjectBuilder instances, which then produce metadata, with no external untrusted data directly influencing critical operations beyond the provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard library functions and well-known package interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate project wheel metadata using standard mechanisms and environment isolation when specified. It employs tempfile and pathlib for safe temporary and file handling. The subprocess runner is parameterized, reducing risk. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscated logic. The only external dependencies are standard modules and controlled package functions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for retrieving Python package metadata, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to typical design patterns for such tools, with appropriate use of environment isolation and subprocess control.",
