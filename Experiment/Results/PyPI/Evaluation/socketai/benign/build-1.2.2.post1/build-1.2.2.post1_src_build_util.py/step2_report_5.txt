  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n### General observations about the code:\n- The code provides functions to retrieve wheel metadata for a Python project.\n- It uses standard modules (`importlib.metadata`, `tempfile`, `pathlib`) and custom modules (`ProjectBuilder`, `DefaultIsolatedEnv`).\n- It supports both isolated and non-isolated environments.\n- It performs environment setup, dependency installation, and metadata extraction.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets are apparent.\n- Subprocess runner is parameterized, reducing command injection risk.\n- The code appears to be part of a build or packaging utility.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the functions and data sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states the code is legitimate with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies environment setup, dependency installation, and metadata extraction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; subprocess runner is parameterized.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low security risk, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 — acceptable, given dependency installation.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound reasoning. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes environment installation via `env.install`.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; subprocess runner is controlled.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly describes the process.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard usage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate build utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and sound.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n\n- All reports agree the code is standard, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern is the dependency installation (`env.install()`), which could, in theory, be exploited if the package sources are compromised. However, in the context of this code, it is a normal part of build processes.\n- The subprocess runner is parameterized, reducing command injection risks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n\n### **Scores justification:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some reports due to dependency installation, but overall very low.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, related to dependency installation and environment setup, which are standard in build tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, thorough, and correctly interpret the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1    |\n\nThis code appears safe, standard for build tooling, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
