{
  "purpose": "This code retrieves the wheel metadata for a Python project, either in an isolated environment or the current environment.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as source_dir, isolated flag, and runner. Uses environment context managers and project builder methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to environment installation methods (env.install), which could potentially execute code or install dependencies. Uses subprocess runners for backend commands.",
  "flows": "Source parameters → environment setup or direct project builder creation → installation of build requirements → metadata extraction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. No apparent obfuscated code or malicious functions. Use of subprocess runner could invoke external commands, but only within expected scope.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on obtaining package metadata by building the project in an isolated or non-isolated environment. It uses context managers for environment setup and relies on project builder classes for processing. The subprocess runner is an abstraction for running commands, which could potentially be exploited if maliciously replaced, but within this code, it appears standard. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. No suspicious data leaks or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard library modules and imported functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for retrieving project metadata with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior. It relies on external dependencies and environment management but does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions itself.",
