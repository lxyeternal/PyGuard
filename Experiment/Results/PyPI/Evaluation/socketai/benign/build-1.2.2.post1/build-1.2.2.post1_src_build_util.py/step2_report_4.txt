  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Purpose: Retrieve wheel metadata for a Python project, optionally using an isolated environment.\n- Key functions: `_project_wheel_metadata()` and `project_wheel_metadata()`.\n- Uses: `importlib.metadata.PathDistribution`, `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, `DefaultIsolatedEnv`, `ProjectBuilder`.\n- Operations: Environment setup, dependency installation, metadata extraction.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- Standard library and project modules are used.\n- Subprocess runner is parameterized, reducing injection risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Issue presence in code:**\n- The code appears clean, standard, and free of malicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows.\n- Uses well-known libraries and patterns for packaging.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No evident logical errors.\n- The code correctly handles isolated and non-isolated modes.\n- No signs of security flaws or backdoors.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- Confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), fitting the analysis.\n\n**Scores adjustment:**\n- The only point of potential concern is the `securityRisk` being slightly above zero (0.1-0.2). Given the code's straightforwardness, I agree with these low scores.\n- Malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n\n- **Potential malicious claims?** No. All reports correctly identify the code as standard build tooling.\n- **External command execution?** Only via the parameterized `runner`. If the runner is controlled externally, it could be exploited, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **Data leaks or backdoors?** No evidence.\n- **Obfuscation?** None detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities?** No. The code does not perform untrusted input handling or insecure operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, consistent with normal build tooling.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard build process)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard utility for retrieving Python package wheel metadata, with no malicious intent or security issues. The low risk scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the `runner` parameter is controlled and not exploited, but this is outside the scope of the code snippet itself.",
