  "purpose": "This code provides functions to retrieve wheel metadata for a Python project, either in an isolated environment or directly, by building the project and extracting metadata.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'source_dir' parameter (project source directory), environment context (DefaultIsolatedEnv), and subprocess runners (pyproject_hooks.quiet_subprocess_runner).",
  "sinks": "Metadata extraction functions and environment setup, primarily performing file system operations and subprocess calls; no obvious data leaks or malicious sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Source: source_dir parameter and environment contexts -> Environment setup and project build -> Metadata extraction from built project -> Return of metadata object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of environment management and subprocess runners is standard for build tools. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local project modules for build and environment management. It defines functions to build project metadata, either in isolated or non-isolated environments, utilizing context managers and subprocess runners. All operations relate to project metadata retrieval with no signs of malicious intent. The use of temporary directories and environment contexts appears legitimate and typical for such tasks. No data exfiltration, system manipulation, or suspicious network activity is present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate build and metadata extraction tasks typical for Python packaging tools. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this snippet.",
