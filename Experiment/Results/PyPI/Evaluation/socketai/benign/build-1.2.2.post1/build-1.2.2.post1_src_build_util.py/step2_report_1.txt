  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described code and potential issues, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides functions to retrieve wheel metadata for a Python project.\n- Supports both isolated and non-isolated environments.\n- Uses standard modules (`importlib.metadata`, `tempfile`, `pathlib`) and project-specific classes (`ProjectBuilder`, `DefaultIsolatedEnv`).\n- Invokes build processes and extracts metadata via `PathDistribution`.\n- No apparent obfuscated or malicious code.\n- Subprocess execution is parameterized, reducing injection risk.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n**Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n- The code appears straightforward and adheres to common patterns in Python packaging.\n- No signs of code that would cause errors or security issues.\n- No evidence of malicious backdoors, obfuscated logic, or data leaks.\n- The subprocess runner is parameterized, which is good practice.\n- Use of temporary directories and environment contexts is standard.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- They correctly note the use of environment management, subprocess control, and metadata extraction.\n- No report claims the code performs any malicious actions or contains vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is justified given the code's clarity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions.\n- The only point of concern could be the subprocess runner, but since it's parameterized and controlled, the risk remains low.\n- No evidence of supply chain or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports agree on 0; this is justified given the code's nature.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports agree on 0; no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- Slight variation: 0.1 to 0.2. Given the code's clarity and standard practices, a risk score of around **0.1** seems appropriate.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code is a typical utility for packaging workflows.\n- No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The parameterization of subprocess execution and environment management reduces potential attack surface.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | **0**           |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**           |\n| Security Risk  | **0.1**         |\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for project metadata extraction, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score reflects the minimal concern based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with my assessment. No changes are necessary.",
