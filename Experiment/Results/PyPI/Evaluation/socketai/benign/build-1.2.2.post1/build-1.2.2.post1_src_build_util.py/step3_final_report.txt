{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the wheel metadata for a Python project, supporting both isolated and non-isolated environments, by setting up build environments, installing dependencies, and extracting metadata via importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the source_dir parameter, environment context managers, and the builder object; it invokes subprocesses via a parameterized runner.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain untrusted data sinks; subprocess runner is parameterized, and no data leaks or external connections are evident.",
  "flows": "Source data (source_dir, environment setup, dependencies) flows through environment installation and build steps, culminating in metadata extraction via PathDistribution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for extracting package metadata, utilizing standard libraries and well-understood patterns. It manages environments safely, installs required dependencies, and extracts metadata without executing untrusted code or revealing secrets. The subprocess runner is parameterized, reducing injection risk. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The code's structure and logic are clear, and the security implications are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. Overall, it is a safe component of a build process.",
