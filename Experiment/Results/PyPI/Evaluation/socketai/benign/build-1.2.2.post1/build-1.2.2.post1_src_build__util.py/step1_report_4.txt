{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify Python package dependencies and parse wheel filenames.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'filename' parameter in parse_wheel_filename and 'req_string' in check_dependency; metadata access via importlib.metadata",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Input 'filename' flows through parse_wheel_filename for regex matching; 'req_string' flows through check_dependency for requirement validation and metadata access",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed; reliance on external libraries (packaging, importlib.metadata) is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious imports",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and performs dependency resolution and wheel filename parsing. The check_dependency function resolves package requirements, checks installed versions, and handles transitive dependencies safely through standard library calls. The parse_wheel_filename function uses regex matching for wheel filenames, with no suspicious pattern or dynamic execution. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The overall code appears to be a legitimate dependency checking utility, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a dependency verification and filename parsing utility, employing standard library functions with no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
