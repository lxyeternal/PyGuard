  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, including version extraction and HTML/LaTeX output settings.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from __init__.py and static configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Version info read from __init__.py, parsed with eval(), no external flows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() to parse __version__, which could execute malicious code if __init__.py is tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with minimal dynamic content. The only dynamic operation is extracting __version__ via eval(), which is a common but potentially unsafe pattern if the source file is compromised. No network calls, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The use of eval() introduces a slight security concern, but in controlled environments, this is generally acceptable. The overall structure and content are straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file with a minor security concern due to eval() usage. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score should be low, approximately 0.1, reflecting the eval() pattern but no active malicious activity.",
