  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file. The only dynamic operation is reading version info from `__init__.py` using `eval()`. No malicious behavior, external data, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 (low). Confidence high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** The use of `eval()` is a minor concern but common in such scripts. No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the `eval()` usage for extracting `__version__`. Recognizes potential risk but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.3 (moderate). Confidence 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** The `eval()` remains the main concern, but within a controlled context. No malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard configuration, no suspicious code or external activity. Reads version info similarly, no obfuscation or malware.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0. Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Very low risk, straightforward configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, no malicious behavior. Reads version info with `eval()`, but it's controlled.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Minimal risk, standard setup.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as others, with no suspicious activity. The `eval()` is used only to parse version info.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0. Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The `eval()` usage is a common pattern for version extraction, not malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher in some reports due to `eval()`, but overall very low. The `eval()` is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — the only concern is the use of `eval()` for version parsing, which is a known pattern but could be exploited if the `__init__.py` is compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation. The only minor security concern is the use of `eval()` to parse version info, which should be replaced with safer alternatives like `ast.literal_eval()` to mitigate potential risks if the source files are tampered with.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nReplace `eval()` with `ast.literal_eval()` for safer parsing, but overall, the code is safe and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0.0** | **0.0**      | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects a very low security risk with no malware or obfuscation present.",
