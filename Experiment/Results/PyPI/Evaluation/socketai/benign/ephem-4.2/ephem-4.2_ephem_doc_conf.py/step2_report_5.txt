  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, primarily setting static parameters.\n- The only dynamic operation is reading the version info from `__init__.py` and parsing it with `eval()`.\n- No network activity, external data handling, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The use of `eval()` on a local file is a potential security concern but is a common pattern for version extraction in controlled environments.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard configuration with a single `eval()` use, which could be risky but is common.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — reasonable; no malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated due to `eval()`, but overall low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the risk of `eval()` on `__version__`.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — slightly higher, reflecting concern about `eval()`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7 — reasonable, given the potential risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the main concern as `eval()`.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Also notes the standard nature, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high confidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizes the benign nature.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to `eval()`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Concludes the code is benign, with `eval()` usage being controlled.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — aligns with the controlled usage.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but all are low, reflecting the minor concern about `eval()`.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — mainly due to `eval()` usage, but in a controlled, local context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The primary concern is the use of `eval()` for version parsing, which is a known pattern but should be replaced with safer alternatives (e.g., `ast.literal_eval()`).\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign configuration script with a minor security concern regarding `eval()`. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
