  "purpose": "The script sets up the 'ephem' Python package, including reading version info, preparing extensions, and package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py', reads 'README.rst' file, inspects 'sys.argv' for 'bdist_wheel', and glob patterns for C source files.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources are passed to functions that execute or evaluate untrusted data directly; no untrusted input is used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution; standard setup.py pattern with conditional import and file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python C extension package, with careful handling of different Python versions and OS specifics. The only dynamic evaluation is reading the version string with eval(), which is somewhat risky but is confined to a known variable. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified. The use of 'eval' on a line from a package file may be considered slightly risky but is unlikely malicious since it's reading a version string from source code. No external network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for the 'ephem' package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of 'eval()' to parse the version, which is controlled by the package author and not malicious. Overall, it is a safe and standard setup script.",
