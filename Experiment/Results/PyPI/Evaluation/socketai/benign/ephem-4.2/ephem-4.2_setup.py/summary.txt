  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor security concern due to eval() usage for version parsing. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the eval() concern but low likelihood of malicious intent."
