{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the ephem library, specifically testing angle conversions and constructors.",
  "sources": "Reading input strings for degrees and hours, e.g., in degrees() and hours() function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to external effects or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted to Angle, degrees, or hours objects, then tested for correctness; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test suite for the ephem library's Angle, degrees, and hours functions. It validates constructor behavior, string parsing, exception raising, and arithmetic operations. No external data is read from untrusted sources at runtime; all inputs are hardcoded test strings or values. There are no suspicious patterns, code injections, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and correctness checks on the ephem library functions without any external data or side effects.",
