{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ephem library's Angle, degrees, and hours functions, primarily for verifying angle calculations and conversions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string inputs and numeric literals for unit test inputs. No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code converts string representations of angles to degrees/hours and performs arithmetic operations; data flow is straightforward and internal.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. Usage of standard testing functions and library calls appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for the ephem library, verifying angle conversions and arithmetic. It only uses safe, static test data without external inputs or outputs. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code structure is typical for testing modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for the ephem library functions, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
