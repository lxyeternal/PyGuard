  "purpose": "Static loader of star catalog data for astronomical calculations using the ephem library.",
  "sources": "Embedded static data string 'db' containing star information, read via ephem.readdb()",
  "sinks": "In-memory star objects; no external data flows or network communication",
  "flows": "Parsing static data into ephem star objects; lookup functions accessing in-memory data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual data handling; data sourced from reputable catalogs",
  "analysis": "The code loads static star data into ephem objects, providing lookup functions. It uses standard library functions without dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated segments. The data is embedded from trusted sources, and no secrets or external inputs are involved. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the static, read-only nature of the data and absence of external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static star catalog loader with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with its purpose and implementation.",
