  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string to the __version__ variable, a common practice for versioning in Python packages. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious code behaviors present. The minimal nature of this code indicates no malicious intent or security risks.",
