{
  "purpose": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version indicator.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reads; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow exists beyond the static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, static variable assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string, common in Python packages. It contains no input handling, data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this as benign. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
