  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports reference the same snippet: `__version__ = '0.6.0'`. This is a straightforward assignment of a string to a variable, common in Python packages for versioning purposes.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n- The code does **not** contain any input handling, data processing, network calls, or external data reads.  \n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.  \n- The code is minimal, static, and adheres to standard practices.\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is benign, with no issues or malicious elements.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.  \n- They correctly identify the code as a simple version assignment, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`, and `confidence=1`.  \n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.  \n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n- Since all reports agree on zero risk, and the code is standard, there is no justification for higher scores.  \n- The risk scores are correctly set to zero, reflecting no security threat.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n- The malware score is zero across all reports, which is correct.  \n- No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.  \n- No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n8. **Score Consistency**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**:  \nThe code is a trivial version string assignment with no input, output, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The consistent zero scores across all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is entirely benign.  \n- No security issues, obfuscation, or malware are present.  \n- The scores are accurate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation**: Keep the scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
