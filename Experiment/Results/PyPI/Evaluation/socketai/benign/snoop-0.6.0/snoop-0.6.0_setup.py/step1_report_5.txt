{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and run the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import statement for 'setuptools' and the conditional main block that calls setup()",
  "sinks": "The setup() function itself, which executes during installation or build processes",
  "flows": "Import 'setuptools' -> if __name__ == '__main__': -> execute setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for package setup",
  "analysis": "This script imports the 'setuptools' library, a common tool for packaging Python projects. It then checks if the script is being run as the main module and calls setup(). The code is very simple and typical for Python package configuration, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or malicious code. There are no external data inputs, network connections, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python packaging script that calls setup() for package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
