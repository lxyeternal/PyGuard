  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only executes the setup() function from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for packaging; no anomalies or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() within a main guard. It does not include any parameters or additional logic that could conceal malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a standard boilerplate for packaging Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, harmless setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package setup procedures without any suspicious behavior.",
