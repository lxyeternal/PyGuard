{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call, which may process setup configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the setup() call executes as-is.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no unusual language features, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' if run as the main program. There are no hardcoded credentials, network operations, file manipulations, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is typical for a package setup script and does not contain any malware indicators or malicious logic. Its simplicity and standard pattern suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious or suspicious features. It poses no security risk and is typical in Python packaging workflows.",
