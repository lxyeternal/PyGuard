{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script that imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it within a main guard to facilitate package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources; it simply executes the 'setup()' function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code performs no data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script executes 'setup()' with default parameters without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual constructs. It is a standard boilerplate for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a canonical example of a Python package setup script, importing 'setup' from 'setuptools' and invoking it within a main guard. No external inputs, secrets, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging patterns indicate no security risks or malicious intent. All signals point to a benign, standard script with no anomalies or suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless Python setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0 for consistency and accuracy.",
