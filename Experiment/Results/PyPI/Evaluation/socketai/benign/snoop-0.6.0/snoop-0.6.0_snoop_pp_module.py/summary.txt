  "conclusion": "The code is a debugging utility employing AST transformation and dynamic evaluation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of eval() on source code, which is justified in a controlled debugging environment. The scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.3–0.4 due to eval() usage."
