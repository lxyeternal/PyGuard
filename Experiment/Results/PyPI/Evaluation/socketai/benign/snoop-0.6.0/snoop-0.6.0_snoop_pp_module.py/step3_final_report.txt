  "purpose": "A debugging utility that uses AST manipulation to insert hooks around expressions for logging and inspection.",
  "sources": "Frame information, source nodes, function arguments, AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "eval() for executing transformed AST code, writing formatted logs, modifying frame globals.",
  "flows": "Source data (frame, AST nodes, args) flows through AST transformation and evaluation to output and global state changes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on dynamically generated AST code without sanitization; modification of frame globals for hook functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a debugging and tracing tool that manipulates ASTs to insert hooks for logging expressions. It uses eval() to execute the transformed AST, which poses a security risk if inputs are untrusted. No malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The eval() usage is controlled within a debugging context, and the code is well-structured and transparent. The main concern is the eval() call, but given the purpose, it is acceptable with caution. The code does not exfiltrate data or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a debugging utility employing AST transformation and dynamic evaluation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of eval() on source code, which is justified in a controlled debugging environment. The scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.3–0.4 due to eval() usage.",
