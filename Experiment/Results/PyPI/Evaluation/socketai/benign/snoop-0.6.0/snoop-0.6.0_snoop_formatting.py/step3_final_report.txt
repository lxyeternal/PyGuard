  "purpose": "A Python debugging and source code visualization utility that highlights syntax, tracks execution events, and formats source code for analysis.",
  "sources": "Source code text, AST nodes, frame objects, environment variables, and execution frame info.",
  "sinks": "Highlighting functions, string formatting for display, variable inspection, exception formatting, and source code retrieval.",
  "flows": "Source code and frame info flow into highlighting, formatting, and event logging functions to produce debug output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard debugging and visualization libraries, performs source highlighting, event tracking, and variable inspection. No malicious behaviors such as network access, code injection, or backdoors are present. It relies on well-known modules and techniques for source code analysis and display. The absence of obfuscation or malicious patterns indicates a legitimate debugging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, sophisticated debugging and source visualization tool with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with its functionality and content.",
