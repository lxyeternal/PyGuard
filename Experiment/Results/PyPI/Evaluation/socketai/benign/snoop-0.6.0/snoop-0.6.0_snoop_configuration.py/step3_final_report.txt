  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the 'snoop' debugging/tracing library, injecting debugging functions into builtins and managing output formatting and behavior.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions, environment variables, system info, and internal module imports.",
  "sinks": "Writing to files, stdout, or callable streams; formatting output for debugging purposes.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters influence output functions, formatting, and debugging behavior without untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'shitcode' module, use of 'ctypes' for Windows console configuration, dynamic attribute setting, and injection into builtins.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate setup for a debugging utility ('snoop'), configuring output, formatting, and console features. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications are evident. The import of 'shitcode' is suspicious but its implementation is unknown; it may be benign or placeholder. The flexible output handling could be misused if parameters are maliciously controlled, but no active malicious behavior is present. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for debugging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate debugging/tracing setup with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the 'shitcode' import, which is suspicious but not confirmed malicious. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
