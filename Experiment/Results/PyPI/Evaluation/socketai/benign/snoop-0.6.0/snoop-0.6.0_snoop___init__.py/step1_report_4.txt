{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python decorator module 'snoop' that logs function execution details, including variable changes, for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (collections, sys) and local modules (.configuration, .variables, .version). Reads version information and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to sys.modules['snoop'] which makes the module callable; dynamic attribute assignment to the 'snoop' object; importing and executing functions from local modules.",
  "flows": "Imports → Configuration setup → Assigns 'snoop' to sys.modules for module callability → Adds attributes from globals to 'snoop' object.",
  "anomalies": "Assigning 'snoop' to sys.modules['snoop']' could be used maliciously to intercept or hijack module behavior, but in context it appears intended for making the module callable. The dynamic attribute assignment might be exploited if malicious code is injected into globals, but the code explicitly excludes certain keys.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a logging decorator 'snoop' for debugging, along with version handling and module setup. No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The only noteworthy aspect is assigning 'snoop' to sys.modules, which is a known pattern for making a decorator function directly callable as a module. The global attribute addition is controlled to exclude certain names, reducing risk of code injection. Overall, the code appears standard and intended for debugging support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard debugging utility with no evident malicious intent or harmful behavior. The module setup and attribute assignment are typical for such debugging tools. No security risks or malware detected.",
