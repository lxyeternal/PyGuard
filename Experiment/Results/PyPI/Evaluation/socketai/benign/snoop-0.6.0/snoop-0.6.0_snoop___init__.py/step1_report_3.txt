  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python decorator for logging function calls and variables, and sets up module attributes and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections, sys, and local modules (.configuration, .variables, .version). Reads the __version__ string and version info.",
  "sinks": "Assigns to sys.modules['snoop'], sets attributes on the 'snoop' object, and dynamically sets global attributes.",
  "flows": "Imports and version parsing flow into setting module attributes, which are then assigned to the 'snoop' object and sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual is the assignment 'sys.modules['snoop'] = snoop', which replaces or assigns the 'snoop' module in sys.modules. Dynamic attribute assignment from globals() could potentially inject unexpected attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a decorator logging module. It imports necessary modules, loads version info, creates a configuration object, and sets up module attributes. The re-binding of 'snoop' in sys.modules is typical for making the decorator directly callable as a module. The global attribute injection avoids polluting the namespace by filtering keys. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious backdoors are detected. The logic is straightforward and aligns with a typical Python package initialization pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign initialization script for a Python logging decorator package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors. The dynamic global attribute setting warrants caution but appears intentional and controlled.",
