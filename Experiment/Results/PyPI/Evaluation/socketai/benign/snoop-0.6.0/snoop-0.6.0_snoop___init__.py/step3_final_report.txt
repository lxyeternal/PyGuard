  "purpose": "Setup for a debugging decorator ('snoop') that logs function calls and variable states, with version handling and dynamic attribute assignment.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, reads version info, sets up configuration, and dynamically adds globals to the 'snoop' object.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to sys.modules['snoop'] and dynamic global attribute setting; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Version parsing → configuration setup → globals() filtering → attribute assignment → sys.modules override.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'sys.modules['snoop'] = snoop' is unusual but a known pattern for making modules callable; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module initialization for a debugging utility, with version handling and dynamic attribute addition. The sys.modules assignment allows the module to be used as a callable decorator. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The pattern is common in Python modules designed to be used as decorators or proxies. The security risk is minimal, justified by the controlled nature of attribute filtering and the purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup for a debugging utility with no malicious activity or security issues. The pattern used is standard and controlled, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
