  "purpose": "A comprehensive framework for monkey patching in Python, allowing dynamic modification, creation, application, and reversion of patches through reflection, decorators, and attribute management.",
  "sources": "Uses reflection functions like getattr, setattr, inspect.getmro, and module iteration via pkgutil to read and manipulate class/module attributes.",
  "sinks": "Attribute setting and getting functions (setattr, getattr, delattr) that modify object or class attributes at runtime.",
  "flows": "Source functions (attribute access, module iteration) lead to attribute modifications via setattr or deletion, affecting target objects or classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external network or file operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, open-source utility for monkey patching, employing standard Python reflection and module management techniques. It provides mechanisms for creating, applying, reverting, and finding patches, with decorator support for granular control. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The extensive use of dynamic attribute handling is typical for such frameworks. The code's purpose is explicitly for runtime modification, which inherently carries some security considerations, but the implementation itself is benign and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source monkey patching utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Its design is standard for such tools, and while it can be misused, the code itself is safe. The security risk is minimal and primarily relates to potential misuse rather than inherent vulnerabilities.",
