    "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data",

    "Standard configuration code for documentation setup"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration file that imports standard modules and the 'gorilla' package to set project metadata and configuration options. It modifies sys.path to include the parent directory, likely for local module resolution, which is common in project setups. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. All operations are related to documentation configuration, with no external data inputs, sinks, or malicious flows detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx configuration script for the 'gorilla' project, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
