  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version detection",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "Version check via sys.version_info leads to conditional assignment of assertCountEqual",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compatibility code",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, checks Python version, and conditionally assigns 'assertCountEqual' to 'assertItemsEqual' for Python 2. This is a standard pattern for cross-version compatibility in test suites. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The code is clear, simple, and does not handle untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim with no security or malicious concerns. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores.",
