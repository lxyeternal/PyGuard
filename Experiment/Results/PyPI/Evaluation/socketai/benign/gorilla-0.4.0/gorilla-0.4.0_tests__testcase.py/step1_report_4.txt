  "purpose": "The code sets up compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 for testing purposes, specifically for unittest framework compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info to determine Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is checked to set class attribute alias; no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, checks Python version to define compatibility adjustments for unittest. It only alters the class attribute based on version; no input/output, no suspicious behavior or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python 2/3 in unit testing contexts. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
