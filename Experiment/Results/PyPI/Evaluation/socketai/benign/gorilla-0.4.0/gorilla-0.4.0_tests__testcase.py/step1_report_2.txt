  "purpose": "This code sets up compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 for unit testing.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads sys.version_info to determine Python version; conditionally assigns assert method for unittest.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, checks Python version, and conditionally redefines a unittest assertion method for Python 2. It is a standard pattern for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign compatibility shim for unittest between Python 2 and 3. No malware or security risks detected.",
