{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a basic Python unittest framework with compatibility for Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading Python version info and defining a test case class; no data flows from external inputs to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily ensures compatibility between Python 2 and 3 for unittest assertions. It imports sys and unittest, then defines a class that conditionally sets an assertion method for Python 2. There are no input handling, data manipulation, or external communication functions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility setup for unittests with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
