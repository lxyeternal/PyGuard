{
  "purpose": "The code sets up compatibility imports and a custom test case class for running unit tests with support for Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info to determine Python version; no external or untrusted data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points, no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths, primarily static code setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for version detection and redefining unittest assert method for Python 2 compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with encoding declaration and future imports for compatibility. It imports sys and unittest modules, then checks Python version to conditionally define a class attribute. The GorillaTestCase class extends unittest.TestCase, modifying assertCountEqual for Python 2. This is standard compatibility code without any data handling, malicious logic, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard compatibility setup for unit testing across Python versions. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious actions.",
