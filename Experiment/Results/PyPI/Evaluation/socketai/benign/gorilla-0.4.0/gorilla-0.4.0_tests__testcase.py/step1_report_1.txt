  "purpose": "The code appears to set up compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 for unit testing using unittest framework.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version information from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> conditional assertion override",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional attribute assignment for backward compatibility is normal; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, checks Python version, and modifies unittest.TestCase to ensure compatibility across Python 2 and 3. It primarily aims to maintain compatibility and does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network operations. No suspicious or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility setup for unit testing frameworks and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
