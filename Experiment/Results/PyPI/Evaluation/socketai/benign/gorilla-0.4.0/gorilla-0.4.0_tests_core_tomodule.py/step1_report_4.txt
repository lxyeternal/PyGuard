{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of classes, functions, and variables with no evident direct malicious intent; appears to be a library module with typical class and function definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads from standard Python constructs: class attributes, function calls, property getters/setters, and static/class methods; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file operations, subprocess calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; internal data flow is limited to class attributes and methods, with no external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated or unusual language features; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes and functions with clear, standard Python syntax. It includes class attributes, methods, property decorators, and inheritance. There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. The code lacks any suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system tampering. It seems to serve as a typical module for object-oriented programming without hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module with class definitions and functions, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
