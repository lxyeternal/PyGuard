{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple Python module with classes, functions, and variables primarily returning static strings or data, serving as a utility or demonstration module.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, property getters/setters, functions returning static data, and the 'stack' function returning a static tuple.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes or functions to return statements; no untrusted input flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions with static and instance variables, properties, and simple methods that return static strings. The 'stack' function returns a fixed tuple. There are no external inputs, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All classes and functions serve straightforward purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. It functions as a basic utility module with no security concerns.",
