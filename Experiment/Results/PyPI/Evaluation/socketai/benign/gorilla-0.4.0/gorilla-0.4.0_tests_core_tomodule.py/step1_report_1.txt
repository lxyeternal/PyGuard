  "purpose": "This code defines a module with classes, functions, and variables, primarily for organizational or library purposes. No apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Global variable 'global_variable', method parameters (none explicitly shown), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Return statements and string formatting functions, which are safe in this context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and method calls to return statements; no untrusted input handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard class and function definitions with straightforward return statements. No usage of input/output operations, external system calls, or network activity. No evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The only functions return constant strings or class attribute values. No suspicious or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module defining classes and functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as an organized, self-contained Python module with no indicators of malicious intent.",
