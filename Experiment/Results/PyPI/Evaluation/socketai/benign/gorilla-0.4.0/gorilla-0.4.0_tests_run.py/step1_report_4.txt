{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to discover and run unit tests in a specified directory or module, optionally filtering tests by partial name matches.",
  "sources": "Input is primarily from command-line arguments and the filesystem (directory paths). It also accesses test modules and functions via import and reflection.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly contain typical sinks like network, file write, or system modification operations; it mainly loads and runs test cases.",
  "flows": "Command-line input → argument parsing → test discovery/loading → execution of selected tests",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of reflection and dynamic test discovery is standard in test runners.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard test discovery and execution utility using Python's unittest framework. It dynamically loads tests from a directory or module, filters by name if provided, and executes them with configurable verbosity. It uses safe and common practices like argument parsing, test loading, and exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden network activities are present. The code does not perform any operations beyond test management and output.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test runner script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for test discovery and execution without any suspicious behavior.",
