{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to discover and run unit tests based on user-provided partial names or all tests if no specific names are given.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from command-line arguments ('name' parameter) and the filesystem (via os.path and unittest discovery).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to pass untrusted data to dangerous sinks such as system commands, network operations, or insecure file writes.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are used to filter test selection; test discovery occurs via unittest's loader and discover functions; selected tests are executed with TextTestRunner.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The use of sys.exit within exception handling is standard. The code relies on standard unittest discovery and execution methods without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses unittest for test discovery and execution. It defines functions to locate tests based on selectors, retrieve test names, and execute tests with configurable verbosity. The code processes command-line input to filter tests. It includes exception handling for module import failures, which terminates execution on such errors. No external or untrusted data is used in dangerous ways. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test runner leveraging Python's unittest framework. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk score is minimal, and the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
