{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up a Python package by reading metadata from a source file and configuring package parameters for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from 'gorilla.py' and 'README.rst', as well as environment files (indirectly via _read function).",
  "sinks": "Setuptools setup function, which handles package installation; no external untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Metadata extracted from 'gorilla.py' flows into setuptools.setup parameters to define package attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The regex used for metadata extraction is standard and benign. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code reads package metadata from a source file ('gorilla.py') using a helper function, then passes this data into the setup configuration. The functions involve file I/O with safe practices; no untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious operations. Usage of regex is straightforward for metadata extraction. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with metadata extraction; it appears legitimate and contains no malicious or suspicious code. No indicators of malware or security risks were found.",
