{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for a Python package named 'gorilla', reading metadata and preparing installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata from 'gorilla.py' and 'README.rst' files, and gathers environment data for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data output, network calls, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Metadata is read from files and passed into setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; the code is straightforward package setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file reading and regular expression parsing to extract package metadata, then invokes setuptools.setup() with the data. No user input, network calls, or suspicious functions are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are observed. All operations are standard for Python packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign Python package setup script without malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
