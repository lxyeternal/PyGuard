  "purpose": "The code is used to read package metadata from a Python file and set up a package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from 'gorilla.py' and 'README.rst' files",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks identified",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('gorilla.py' and 'README.rst') into variables, used in package setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads metadata from a specified Python file ('gorilla.py') using regex pattern matching. It does not execute any external or untrusted code. The setup configuration uses the extracted metadata to define package properties. There is no evidence of malicious actions, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup script that extracts metadata from a Python source file and uses setuptools for package configuration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
