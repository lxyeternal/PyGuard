{
  "purpose": "The code is for a Python package setup script, reading package metadata and configuring the package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata from 'gorilla.py' file and the README.rst file.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed; the code primarily reads files and sets up package info.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata from 'gorilla.py' -> passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic regex pattern matching to extract metadata; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata from a Python file and a README file, then passes this data to setuptools for package creation. It employs a standard approach for sourcing metadata, with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior. No network activity, backdoors, or code injection points are present. The regex patterns are straightforward, used solely for extracting string data. The rest of the setup configuration appears typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
