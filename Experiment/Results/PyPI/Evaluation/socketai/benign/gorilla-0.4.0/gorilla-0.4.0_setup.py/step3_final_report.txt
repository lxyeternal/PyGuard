  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, extracting metadata from 'gorilla.py' and 'README.rst', then configuring package parameters with setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'gorilla.py' for metadata, reading 'README.rst' for long description",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs",
  "flows": "Metadata extracted via regex from 'gorilla.py' used in setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for metadata extraction is standard but could be fragile; no obfuscation or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reads and regex parsing to gather package metadata, then calls setuptools.setup() with static data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The regex patterns are simple and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The overall structure is typical for Python package setup scripts, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
