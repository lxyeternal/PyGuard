  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the logic, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Minimal code, import statements, no overt malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *Risk:* 0.2  \n  - *Confidence:* 0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly notes the lack of suspicious activity.  \n- The confidence is moderate, given limited context.  \n- The security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable; it's low but acknowledges some minimal concern due to code presence.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- No issues detected in the code.  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** No code provided; unable to analyze.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- All zeroes, as expected.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Accurate; without code, no analysis can be performed.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Basic setup code, no suspicious activity, minimal context.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0  \n- *Risk:* 0.2  \n- *Confidence:* 0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly states the benign nature of the code.  \n- The risk score is low, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- No issues; scores align with findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** No code provided; analysis not possible.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- All zeroes, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Correctly notes the absence of code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard data processing script, no suspicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- *Malware:* 0  \n- *Obfuscated:* 0  \n- *Risk:* 0.2  \n- *Confidence:* 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The analysis is thorough and reasonable.  \n- The risk score (0.2) is appropriate; the code appears benign.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code and malicious patterns.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analyses.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident in any of the provided snippets or summaries.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the limited context in some reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minimal, mostly due to presence of code snippets, but no real threat)\n\n**Justification:**  \nAll reports are cautious but accurate, and the data supports that these code snippets are benign or insufficient for assessment. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, and malware/obfuscation scores are zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately scored. No adjustments needed.",
