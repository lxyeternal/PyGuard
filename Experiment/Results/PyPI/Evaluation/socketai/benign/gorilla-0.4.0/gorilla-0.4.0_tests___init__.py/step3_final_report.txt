  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment variables, command line arguments, file I/O, network requests, dynamic code execution, and data flows within the code.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, command execution, data exfiltration points, and dynamic code evaluation.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into functions that perform network requests, file operations, or code execution, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious functions, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns; minimal code snippets with benign descriptions; no malicious indicators observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are minimal or absent, with descriptions indicating standard setup or data processing tasks. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting limited context but reasonable conclusions. No anomalies or indicators of sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified given the minimal or non-existent suspicious activity. Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
