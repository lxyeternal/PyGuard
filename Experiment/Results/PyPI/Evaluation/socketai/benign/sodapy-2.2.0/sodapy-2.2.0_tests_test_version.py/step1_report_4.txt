  "purpose": "The code validates the format of the __version__ string of the sodapy package.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ attribute from the sodapy module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external output.",
  "flows": "Reads __version__ from sodapy, then splits and checks its components; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sodapy, accesses its __version__ attribute, and validates its format by splitting on '.' and checking each component for numeric characters. The purpose is to ensure the version string adheres to a standard 'X.Y.Z' format. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or external communications. It is a straightforward validation function with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple, non-malicious validation of a package version string. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are evident.",
