{
  "purpose": "The code validates the format and length of the version string of the 'sodapy' library.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__version__' attribute from the 'sodapy' module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data to external systems or process untrusted input beyond internal attribute access.",
  "flows": "Retrieves 'sodapy.__version__' and processes it locally; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward version string validation without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'sodapy' library and checks its '__version__' attribute for correct format: exactly three numeric components separated by periods. The assertions ensure version string conformity. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is simple and intended for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version validation check for the 'sodapy' library. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs standard assertions on version string formatting.",
