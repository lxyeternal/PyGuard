  "purpose": "Validate the format of the sodapy package version string to ensure it has three numeric components separated by periods.",
  "sources": "sodapy.__version__ attribute",
  "sinks": "No external data or untrusted data flows; internal validation only",
  "flows": "Version string retrieved from sodapy.__version__, split into components, then assertions on each component",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and performs simple validation",
  "analysis": "The code imports sodapy, retrieves its __version__, splits it by '.', and asserts that there are exactly three parts, each numeric. It performs internal validation without external data or network operations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is clear, and the code is readable. The validation is strict but does not account for pre-release tags or other version formats, which is acceptable given its purpose. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version string validation routine with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not pose any security threat and is safe for supply chain use.",
