  "purpose": "Validate the format and length of the sodapy library's version string.",
  "sources": "Reads the sodapy.__version__ attribute to obtain version information.",
  "sinks": "Assertions do not affect data leak or system state; no external sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Source (sodapy.__version__) -> Version string split and validation logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs simple validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sodapy library and defines a test function to validate the format of its version string. It splits the version string and asserts it has three numeric components. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, or code that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The code is straightforward, focusing solely on version string validation without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple validation test for the sodapy library's version string and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and primarily for ensuring version format correctness.",
