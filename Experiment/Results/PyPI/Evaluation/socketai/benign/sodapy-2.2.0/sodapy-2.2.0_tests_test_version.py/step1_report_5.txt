  "purpose": "Validate the length and format of the version string of the sodapy package.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ attribute of the sodapy module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "Source (__version__ attribute) -> split and assertions (validation). No external data flows or sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The assertions are standard validation checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sodapy library, retrieves its version string, and verifies that it has three numeric components separated by periods. This is a straightforward validation routine with no external data inputs, outputs, or side effects. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious activities. The code appears to be a simple test function ensuring version string format correctness.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version format validation function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs internal validation of a package version string.",
