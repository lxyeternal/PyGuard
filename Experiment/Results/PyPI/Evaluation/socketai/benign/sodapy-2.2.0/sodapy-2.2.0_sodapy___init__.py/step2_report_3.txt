  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements, an `__all__` declaration, and a version assignment. There are no signs of data leaks, dynamic code execution, or network activity. All reports agree that the code appears benign and standard for module setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n   Since the code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns, a high risk score is unwarranted. The current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the fact that there's no malicious activity or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   All reports are cautious and based on observable code features, not assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and the assessments provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only imports and exposes components from the `sodapy` library, which is a legitimate open-source package. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scoring is appropriate. No changes needed.",
