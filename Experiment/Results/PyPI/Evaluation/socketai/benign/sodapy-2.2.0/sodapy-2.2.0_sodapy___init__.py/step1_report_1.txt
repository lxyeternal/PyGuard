{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to import specific components from the 'sodapy' library, likely to facilitate interaction with Socrata data APIs, and to define the module's public interface and version.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from sodapy.socrata import Socrata' and 'from sodapy import version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data output, network transmission, or execution of untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward and minimal. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The __version__ is assigned from the imported version module, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and a version attribute from the sodapy library. It then defines __all__ for public interface control and assigns __version__ to reflect the library's version. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. It appears to be standard module setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a typical import and setup code for a Python module interfacing with the 'sodapy' library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on this code alone.",
