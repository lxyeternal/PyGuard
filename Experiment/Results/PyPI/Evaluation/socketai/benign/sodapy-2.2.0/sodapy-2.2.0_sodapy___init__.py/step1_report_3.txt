  "purpose": "Defines and exports the Socrata class and version information from the sodapy package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing 'Socrata' and 'version' from sodapy.socrata, and accessing 'version.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "Access to 'version.__version__' for retrieving version info; no sinks related to untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "Importing classes and attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'Socrata' class and the 'version' module from 'sodapy'. It then exposes 'Socrata' via __all__ and assigns the version string to __version__. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a simple module setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply imports and exposes components of the 'sodapy' package.",
