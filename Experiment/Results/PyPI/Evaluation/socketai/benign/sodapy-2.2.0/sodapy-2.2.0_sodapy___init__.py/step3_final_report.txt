{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'Socrata' class and the version attribute from the 'sodapy' library, and exposes 'Socrata' via __all__, serving as a module setup or interface layer.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sodapy.socrata' and 'sodapy.version', and the assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns imported values to module variables.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module setup: importing a class and version info, defining __all__, and setting __version__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The current assessment scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
