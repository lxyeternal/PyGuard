  "purpose": "Define module exports and version information for the sodapy package, specifically exposing the Socrata class.",
  "sources": "Importing Socrata class from sodapy.socrata, importing version information from sodapy.version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code simply imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and version info from the sodapy library, and defines __all__ and __version__ variables. No input handling, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears to be standard module setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
