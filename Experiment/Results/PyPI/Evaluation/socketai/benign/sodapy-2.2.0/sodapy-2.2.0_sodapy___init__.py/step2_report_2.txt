  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports a class and a version string from the 'sodapy' library.\n- It defines `__all__` and `__version__`, which are standard practices.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, data processing, or any suspicious patterns.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscated parts, or signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- The reasoning is consistent, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all cases, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is correct.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The only point to consider is whether any of these scores should be higher. Since the code is purely import statements and variable definitions, this seems justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores justification:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks are evident.\n\n### **Challenging assumptions:**\n- None of the reports suggest any suspicious behavior, so the scores seem accurate.\n- The only potential concern could be if the imported 'version' or 'Socrata' modules are malicious, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet; the code itself does not execute or process untrusted data.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, benign module setup.\n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
