{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific components from the sodapy library, likely to expose the Socrata class and version information for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from sodapy.socrata and sodapy.version",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow occurs within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a standard version attribute and an explicit __all__ declaration, which are typical; no suspicious or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code only imports the Socrata class and the version string from the sodapy library. It defines __all__ to specify exported names and assigns __version__ from the library. No input data is read, and no data is sent or executed. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious activity is evident. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup, possibly part of a larger library or application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple module that exposes the Socrata class and version information from sodapy. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks within this snippet.",
