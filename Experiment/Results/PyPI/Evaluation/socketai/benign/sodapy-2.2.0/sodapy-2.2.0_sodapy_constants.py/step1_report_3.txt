  "purpose": "Define API endpoint paths as constants for use within the application",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for API paths",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input handling or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; constants are used internally",
  "anomalies": "All definitions are simple string assignments; no suspicious or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns string literals to constants representing API paths. There are no dynamic or user-controlled inputs, no data processing, no external data reads, and no suspicious behaviors. The constants may be used elsewhere in the codebase for API requests, but in this snippet, they are static definitions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of API endpoint paths, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
