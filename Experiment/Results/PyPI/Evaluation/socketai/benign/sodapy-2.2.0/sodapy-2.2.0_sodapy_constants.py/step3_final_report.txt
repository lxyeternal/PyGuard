  "purpose": "Define static API endpoint paths for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments in the code: DEFAULT_API_PATH, OLD_API_PATH, DATASETS_PATH.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static constants do not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A — static constants; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward constant definitions with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three static string constants defining API paths. There are no functions, input handling, dynamic code, or data processing. The code is clear, simple, and serves as configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static declaration of API path constants with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
