  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static string constants defining API paths.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, or data processing is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.\n- The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The **original code** contains only three string constants:\n  ```python\n  DEFAULT_API_PATH = \"/resource/\"\n  OLD_API_PATH = \"/api/views\"\n  DATASETS_PATH = \"/api/catalog/v1\"\n  ```\n- These are static, hardcoded string assignments with no dynamic behavior or external input.\n\n### Issue presence:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify that these are simple constant definitions with no malicious or security-related concerns.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **In the reports' reasoning:**  \n  They are consistent and accurate. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct, as code is straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — appropriate, no risks are evident.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is static constant definitions with no dynamic or external input, assigning a high risk score would be unreasonable.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is clear and simple.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports avoid assumptions, correctly stating that these are benign constants.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are claimed or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Scores for all reports:**  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- **Overall risk estimation:**  \n  - The code is safe, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scoring is appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nI concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, and the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.",
