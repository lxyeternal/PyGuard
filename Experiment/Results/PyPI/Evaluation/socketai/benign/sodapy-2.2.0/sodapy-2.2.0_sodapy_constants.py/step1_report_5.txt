  "purpose": "Define constants for API endpoint paths used in the application.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to constants at the module level.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; constants are static values used internally within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to constants representing API paths. There are no dynamic inputs, no data processing, and no code execution based on external data. The constants appear to be used for constructing API requests or routing within a larger application. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment consists solely of defining static API path constants with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
