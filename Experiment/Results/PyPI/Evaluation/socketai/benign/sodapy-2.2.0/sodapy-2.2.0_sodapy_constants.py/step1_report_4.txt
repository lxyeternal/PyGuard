  "purpose": "Define constant API paths for use within a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs involved, no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths as the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of string constant assignments with no dynamic or unusual elements. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three string constants representing API endpoint paths. There are no functions, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns observed. The code appears to serve a configuration or constant reference purpose within a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, simply defining static API path constants with no malicious or security-related issues. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
