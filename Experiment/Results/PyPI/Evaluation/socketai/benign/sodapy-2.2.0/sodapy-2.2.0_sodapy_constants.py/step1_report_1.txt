  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward constant assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string values to constants representing API paths. There are no functions, input handling, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The paths appear standard for API route definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment consists solely of static string definitions for API paths with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
