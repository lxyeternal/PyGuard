  "purpose": "Define constants for API endpoint paths used within an application or library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for API paths.",
  "sinks": "None. No data input or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data sources to sinks; only static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; simple constant assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three string constants defining API paths. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The constants seem to serve as configuration or resource identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No hardcoded credentials or insecure practices are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be safe, serving only to define static API path constants. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
