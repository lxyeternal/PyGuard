  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard utility functions. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only potential risk is misuse of the download_file function with malicious URLs, which justifies a small security risk score (~0.2). Overall, the code is safe for use in typical environments."
