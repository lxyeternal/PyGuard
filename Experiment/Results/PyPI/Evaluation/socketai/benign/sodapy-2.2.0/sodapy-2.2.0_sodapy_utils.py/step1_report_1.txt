{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling HTTP responses, URL formatting, authentication validation, and file downloading within a larger API client context.",
  "sources": "Reads response data from HTTP requests (response.json()), URL parameters (dataid, content_type, row_id), and function arguments for API paths and credentials.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to local files (download_file function), and raises exceptions based on response content or invalid parameters.",
  "flows": "HTTP responses are processed to detect errors; URLs are constructed from parameters; user credentials are validated; data from responses may be saved to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The code properly handles exceptions and input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for API interactions: raising HTTP errors, cleaning dictionaries, formatting API URLs, validating authentication methods, and downloading files. All operations are typical and safe. No indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present. The functions handle inputs carefully, with appropriate error handling, and do not use insecure practices. The download function streams content directly to disk without unvalidated processing, which is standard for large file downloads. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs common utility tasks for an API client and contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It adheres to secure coding practices and does not include any backdoors, data leaks, or malicious instructions.",
