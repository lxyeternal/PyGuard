  "purpose": "Utility functions for HTTP response handling, URL formatting, authentication validation, and file downloading in Python.",
  "sources": "response.status_code, response.reason, response.json(), args dictionary, url parameter in download_file",
  "sinks": "raise_for_status raises HTTPError, download_file writes to local file, format functions return formatted URL strings, authentication_validation raises exceptions",
  "flows": "response status and reason -> raise_for_status; args input -> clear_empty_values; url and parameters -> format_old_api_request/format_new_api_request; url -> download_file",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or hidden code; download_file downloads from external URLs without validation; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for HTTP error handling, URL formatting, authentication validation, and file download. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The download_file function fetches data from external URLs directly, which could be exploited if URLs are malicious, but this is typical for utility code. Validation of URLs or content is not included, representing a minor security concern but not malicious intent. Error handling and input validation are appropriate. The code is straightforward and adheres to good practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard utility functions. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only potential risk is misuse of the download_file function with malicious URLs, which justifies a small security risk score (~0.2). Overall, the code is safe for use in typical environments.",
