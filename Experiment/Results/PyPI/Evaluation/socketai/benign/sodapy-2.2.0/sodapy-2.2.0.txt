      "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with a standard pattern for version loading. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors. The only minor concern is the use of exec(), which is acceptable in controlled environments but warrants caution if the version file's integrity cannot be guaranteed."
