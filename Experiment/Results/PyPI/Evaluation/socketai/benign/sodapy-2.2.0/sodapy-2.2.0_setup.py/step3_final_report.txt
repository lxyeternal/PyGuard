  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'sodapy' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'sodapy/version.py' via exec(), reads description from 'README.md', dependencies from 'requirements.txt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data leak operations detected.",
  "flows": "exec() executes contents of 'version.py' to set __version__; no malicious flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if the file is tampered with, but is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with minimal complexity. It reads version info, description, and dependencies, then calls setup() with static metadata. The only notable pattern is the use of exec() to load version data, which is common but could pose security risks if the version file is compromised. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to exec(). All reports agree on this assessment, and the scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with a standard pattern for version loading. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors. The only minor concern is the use of exec(), which is acceptable in controlled environments but warrants caution if the version file's integrity cannot be guaranteed.",
