  "purpose": "The script sets up the package metadata and configuration for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading files: 'sodapy/version.py', 'README.md', and 'requirements.txt'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "Reading data from files and passing configuration to setup(), with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on 'sodapy/version.py' could be risky if the file is tampered with, but it is a common pattern for dynamically importing version info. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads version information dynamically via exec(), which is a common pattern but can be risky if the file content is malicious. It reads README and requirements files for package description and dependencies. The setup() call is standard for Python package distribution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. All operations are read-only and involve static configuration data. The overall structure and content are typical for a setup.py script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks, aside from the use of exec() which is a common but potentially risky pattern if the version file is compromised. No malware, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
