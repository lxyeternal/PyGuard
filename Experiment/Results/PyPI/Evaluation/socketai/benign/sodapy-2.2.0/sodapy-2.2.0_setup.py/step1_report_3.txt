  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the sodapy Python package, including reading version info, description, and requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading 'sodapy/version.py' for version info, 'README.md' for description, and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present. No untrusted data is processed or executed beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files, then passes collected data into setup() to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. exec() used to evaluate version.py, which is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. It securely reads version data, description, and dependencies from files, then uses these to configure the package setup. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of exec() to evaluate version.py is common practice and not inherently malicious in this context. No network, file system modifications, or secret leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears safe and legitimate.",
