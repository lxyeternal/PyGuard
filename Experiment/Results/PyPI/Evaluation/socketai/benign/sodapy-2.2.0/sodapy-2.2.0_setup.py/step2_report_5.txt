  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python library.\n- The only recurring concern is the use of `exec()` to load version information from `version.py`. While common, this pattern can be risky if the version file is tampered with.\n- No reports indicate malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern beyond the exec() pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of `exec()` on `version.py`:** This is a known pattern but can be risky if the file is compromised. However, in typical controlled environments, this is acceptable.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **No actual code errors** are present.\n- **No logical flaws** aside from the potential risk of `exec()`, which is acknowledged.\n- The reports do not identify any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **securityRisk:** between 0.1 and 0.2\n- These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `exec()`, but it's a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Consistently 0 across all reports, justified by the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports correctly identify that the only potential concern is the `exec()` pattern, which is standard but could be exploited if `version.py` is tampered with.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are present.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated code:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minor concern due to use of `exec()`, but common practice)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis setup.py script is a typical, benign package configuration file. The only minor concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which is a common pattern but could be risky if the version file is compromised. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the exec() pattern concern)\n\n**Note:** If you want to be more conservative, you could set the risk to 0.2, but given the context, 0.1 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and standard for Python packaging.",
