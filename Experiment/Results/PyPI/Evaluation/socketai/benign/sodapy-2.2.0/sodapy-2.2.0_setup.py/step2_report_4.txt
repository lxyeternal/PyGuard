  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the script is a standard setup.py for a Python package.\n- The only potentially risky operation is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `sodapy/version.py`.\n- No reports mention any actual malicious code, network activity, or data leaks.\n- The scores for malware are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1–0.2), which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **`exec()` usage:** The code uses `exec(f.read())` on `version.py`. While common, this can be risky if `version.py` is tampered with, as it executes arbitrary code. However, in controlled environments, this pattern is accepted for dynamic version importing.\n\n**No other anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.**\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n\n- All correctly state that the code is standard, with `exec()` being the only minor concern.\n- They assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- They assign security risk scores around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the minor risk from `exec()`.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8–1), which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential issues in reasoning:**\n\n- The reports mention that `exec()` could be risky if the file is tampered with, which is accurate.\n- They do not overstate the risk; they acknowledge that this pattern is common but could be exploited if the file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - The malware scores are appropriate at 0, as no malicious code or behavior is present.\n  - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n  - The security risk scores are low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Any adjustments?**\n  - No. The scores and reasoning seem consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minor risk due to `exec()`, but common in setup scripts)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a typical, benign setup.py script with a common pattern (`exec()`) for version importing. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The minor risk associated with `exec()` is acknowledged but does not warrant a higher score.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Code issues:** No, aside from the known `exec()` pattern.\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (due to `exec()` pattern, but standard practice)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and reasoning.",
