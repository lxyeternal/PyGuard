  "purpose": "Setup script for the sodapy Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'sodapy/version.py' for version info, 'README.md' for long description, and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files (sources) and passes metadata to setup function (sink). No untrusted data flows to critical system functions or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; standard setup script with no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and reads external files for versioning, description, and dependencies. It then constructs a dictionary with package metadata and invokes setup(). No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code follows common practices for Python package setup, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
