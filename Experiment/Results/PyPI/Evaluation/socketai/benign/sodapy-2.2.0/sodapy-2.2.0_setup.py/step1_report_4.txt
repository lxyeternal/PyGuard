  "purpose": "Setup script for the sodapy Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'sodapy/version.py', reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is being written or executed in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Reading files (version.py, README.md, requirements.txt) -> parsing content -> passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from 'sodapy/version.py' is potentially risky if the file content is malicious, but this is a common pattern for version extraction. No other suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads version information via 'exec()', which is typical in setup scripts. It reads README and requirements files for package details. The setup() function is called with standard package metadata. No input validation or user input handling occurs, minimizing risk. The only noteworthy point is the use of exec() on a version file, which could be a vector if the file is compromised, but this pattern is widely accepted for managing version info.\n\nThere are no hardcoded credentials, network communications, or code that could be malicious. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No obfuscated code or suspicious code flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which is a common pattern but could pose a risk if the version file is compromised. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
