  "purpose": "Set up configuration for building and distributing the 'sodapy' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'version.py' for version info, 'README.md' for description, and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads version data, description, and requirements; passes collected info to 'setup()' for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' to execute code from 'version.py' could be risky if the file content is malicious or tampered, but in typical setup files, this is a common pattern to import version info.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info, long description, and dependencies, then passing them to setuptools.setup(). There are no external inputs from untrusted sources, no code injection beyond the common 'exec()' for versioning, which is typical but slightly risky if 'version.py' is compromised. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The use of 'exec()' is a known pattern for dynamically importing version variables and is not inherently malicious but warrants attention in case of tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no evident malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec()' to execute code from 'version.py', which could be exploited if the file is malicious or tampered with, but in a typical controlled environment, this is common practice. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
