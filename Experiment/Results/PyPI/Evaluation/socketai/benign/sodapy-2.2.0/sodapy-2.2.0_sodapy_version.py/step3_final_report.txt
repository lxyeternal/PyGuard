  "purpose": "Define a static version string for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it initializes a tuple and joins its elements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A — static assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string construction.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple (2, 2, 0) to 'version_info' and constructs '__version__' by joining its elements with periods. It is a standard pattern for defining package versions. No dynamic code, external inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies confirm the absence of security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for defining a version string with no security risks or malicious behavior. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
