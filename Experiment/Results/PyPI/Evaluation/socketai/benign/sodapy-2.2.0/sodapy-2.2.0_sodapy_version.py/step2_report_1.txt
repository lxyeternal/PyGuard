  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:  \nAll reports confirm that the code simply initializes a tuple `version_info = (2, 2, 0)` and constructs a string `__version__` by joining the tuple elements with periods. This is a common pattern for defining package version strings in Python.  \n**Conclusion**: The code is straightforward, with no dynamic inputs, no external dependencies, and no suspicious or obfuscated patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is benign, standard, and has no security issues.  \n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.  \n- The analysis is thorough and aligns with best practices for such version definitions.\n\n3. **Scores Review & Justification**:  \n- All reports assign `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, and `obfuscated=0`. These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- No report suggests any potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent, and the code does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:  \n- The risk score is set to 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- Malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.  \n- Given the code's simplicity, these scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall**, the code is a standard version string assignment with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
