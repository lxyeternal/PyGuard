  "purpose": "Set the version string of the package based on a tuple of version components.",
  "sources": "The 'version_info' tuple defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "The __version__ string that is created by joining the version_info tuple elements.",
  "flows": "The 'version_info' tuple is read to generate the __version__ string via join operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply constructs a version string from a tuple.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version components (2, 2, 0). It then converts each component to a string and joins them with periods to form a version string. There are no inputs from external sources, no use of environment variables, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a standard way to define package version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended to define a version string for a package. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
