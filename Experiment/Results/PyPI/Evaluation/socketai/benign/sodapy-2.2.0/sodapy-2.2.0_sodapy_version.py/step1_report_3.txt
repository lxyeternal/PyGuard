  "purpose": "Define the package version information as a string for use in the module.",
  "sources": "The 'version_info' tuple is a hardcoded data source used to construct the version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the 'version_info' tuple to the '__version__' string via a join operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple representing version numbers to 'version_info'. It then creates a string '__version__' by joining the tuple elements with periods. This is a common pattern for defining package versions in Python modules. The code is straightforward and does not involve any input, output, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
