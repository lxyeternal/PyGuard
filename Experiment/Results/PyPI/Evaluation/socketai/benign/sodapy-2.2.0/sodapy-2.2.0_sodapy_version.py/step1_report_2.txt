  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string creation",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple with version numbers, then constructs a string '__version__' by joining the tuple elements converted to strings. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious behavior or obfuscated code. The purpose appears to be simply setting version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard version assignment, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
