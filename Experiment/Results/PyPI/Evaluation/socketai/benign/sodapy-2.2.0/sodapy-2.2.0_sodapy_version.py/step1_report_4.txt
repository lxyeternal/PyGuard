  "purpose": "Define the version of the module or package as a string based on a tuple of version numbers.",
  "sources": "The 'version_info' tuple is a hardcoded source within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only processes a static tuple.",
  "flows": "The tuple 'version_info' flows into a string join operation to produce '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a tuple 'version_info' with fixed integers representing version components. It then converts each element to a string and joins them with periods to create a version string stored in '__version__'. There are no external inputs, no data leakage, no code injection, and no malicious behavior detected. The code is typical for defining a version string in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and standard for setting a version string. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
