  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module as a string based on a tuple of version numbers.",
  "sources": "The variable 'version_info' initialized with a tuple (2, 2, 0).",
  "sinks": "Joining the version tuple into a string; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "The tuple 'version_info' is converted to strings and joined into '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version info is common practice; no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a version string from a predefined tuple of integers. It performs straightforward data manipulation without external input, environment variables, or network activity. No obfuscation, no malicious code, and no security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign pattern for defining package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
