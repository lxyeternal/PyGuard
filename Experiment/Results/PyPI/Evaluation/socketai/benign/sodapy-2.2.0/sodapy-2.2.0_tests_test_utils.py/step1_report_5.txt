{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for various utility functions in the sodapy.utils module, verifying error handling, data cleaning, API request formatting, authentication validation, and file downloading.",
  "sources": "Test input data, mock responses, and function parameters such as response objects, dictionaries, and URL strings.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data directly to files, executes system commands, or performs network operations with untrusted input beyond standard request mocking. The download_file function uses URLs provided as input but in a controlled test environment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate request paths, validate inputs, or simulate responses. Mocked responses feed data into utility functions, which process them accordingly without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly performs testing of utility functions with controlled input. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. All network interactions are mocked, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test cases for utility functions such as status handling, data cleaning, request path formatting, authentication validation, and file downloading. It uses standard testing frameworks and mocking to simulate network interactions and responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or code sabotage. The functions tested do not involve executing external or untrusted code, nor do they manipulate sensitive data in an insecure manner. The use of mocking indicates a controlled testing environment, reducing risk exposure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a utility module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It employs best practices for testing and mocking, and the logic is straightforward and safe.",
