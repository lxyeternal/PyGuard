{
  "purpose": "This code sets up an AWS CDK module by importing necessary libraries, loading a JSII assembly for AWS API Gateway v2 alpha, and publishing the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements, jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() call, publication.publish()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data",
  "flows": "Imports and assembly loading lead to module setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for AWS CDK setup",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, assembly loading, and publishing commands. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or execution of untrusted code. The structure is typical for infrastructure setup scripts. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS CDK setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
