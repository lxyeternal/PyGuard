{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and load a JSII assembly for the AWS CDK AWS API Gateway v2 alpha package, likely used for infrastructure as code deployment.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata and module information for JSII assembly loading, imports external libraries (jsii, publication, typeguard), and loads the assembly with specific versioning info.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious actions. The only actions are module imports and assembly loading.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, loading a specific JSII assembly for AWS CDK, and publishing metadata. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. The code is straightforward setup code for a library.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs imports and loads a JSII assembly for the AWS CDK. It does not execute untrusted input or perform any network operations. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are detected. The usage aligns with typical SDK or infrastructure setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python package that interacts with AWS CDK via JSII. It contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and purely functional.",
