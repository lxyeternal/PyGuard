  "purpose": "Load and query a Kaggle dataset related to basketball draft history using the kagglehub library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for kagglehub and KaggleDatasetAdapter; dataset_load function call with dataset identifier and SQL query.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe SQL query execution within dataset_load, printing dataset shape and head (displaying data).",
  "flows": "Input data from Kaggle dataset → SQL query executed in dataset_load → data returned as a DataFrame → printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code behaviors; usage of standard library calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library designed for Kaggle dataset interaction, loads a specific SQLite dataset with a simple SQL SELECT query, and prints dataset info and preview. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The SQL query appears standard and safe. Overall, the code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to load and display a Kaggle dataset subset. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is present. It executes a simple SQL query and outputs data information. Security risks are minimal.",
