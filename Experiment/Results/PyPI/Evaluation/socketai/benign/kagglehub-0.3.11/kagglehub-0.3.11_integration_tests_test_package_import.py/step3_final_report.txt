{
  "purpose": "The code is a suite of unittests for the 'package_import' function in the 'kagglehub' package, verifying package loading, version handling, dependency installation, and user prompts.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, sys.modules for package modules, subprocess calls for uninstalling dependencies, dynamic imports of packages.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data sources are limited to user input; subprocess calls can affect system state (install/uninstall packages); dynamic imports could execute malicious code if package is compromised.",
  "flows": "User input -> package_import decision flow; sys.modules -> package module management; subprocess -> dependency uninstall; dynamic import -> package execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; subprocess calls are standard in testing but could be risky outside controlled environments; no obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite that mocks user input, manages sys.modules, and performs package install/uninstall operations within a controlled testing context. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. Use of subprocess for uninstalling dependencies is typical in tests but could be dangerous if misused outside testing. The code's clarity and straightforward structure indicate no obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score of 0.2 reflects potential danger if used outside a controlled environment, but within tests, it is acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for testing package import and dependency management. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior, and no modifications are necessary.",
