  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'package_import' function from the 'kagglehub' package, verifying package import behavior, confirmation prompts, and dependency handling.",
  "sources": "Input prompts via 'builtins.input', mock patches for user input, import statements, subprocess calls for pip uninstall.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or command execution via subprocess (pip uninstall), or side effects from importlib and sys modules.",
  "flows": "User input influences whether package imports proceed; subprocess uninstall can modify system state based on code execution; import handling may trigger code in imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple confirmation prompts for package import, dynamic import management, and potential uninstallation of dependencies during tests; no evident malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing for a package import utility, involving user prompts, mock inputs, dependency management, and import handling. It installs and uninstalls packages during tests, which could be considered unusual but is consistent with testing practices. No code shows data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoor mechanisms. The subprocess call to pip uninstall is potentially risky if misused, but within a controlled test environment, it is intended for cleanup. No suspicious or malicious behavior or code injection is detected. The code's structure and logic are standard for testing scenarios, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for package import functionality, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The subprocess calls and dynamic import management are typical for testing package dependencies but should be carefully managed in production environments. Overall, there are no signs of malware or security risks in this code.",
