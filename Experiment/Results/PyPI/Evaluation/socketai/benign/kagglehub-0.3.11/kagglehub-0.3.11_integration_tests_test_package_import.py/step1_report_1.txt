  "purpose": "Unit tests for the kagglehub package_import function, testing package loading, versioning, and dependency handling.",
  "sources": "Mocked user input (builtins.input), importlib and sys modules, subprocess calls for package management.",
  "sinks": "importlib.util.find_spec, subprocess.check_call, sys.modules modifications, package_import calls.",
  "flows": "User input -> package_import logic flow; subprocess uninstall -> sys.modules update; importlib checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of subprocess for uninstall may be concerning but is standard for dependency cleanup in tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unittests verifying package import functionality, including version handling, dependency installation, and authentication scenarios. The tests patch 'input' to simulate user confirmation and manipulate sys.modules for cleanup. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The subprocess call to uninstall packages is typical in test environments to ensure clean state. The code does not include any obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or data exfiltration routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for the package_import function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs testing of package import logic, dependency management, and user confirmation flow without malicious or malicious-looking behavior.",
