  "purpose": "Load a dataset from the KaggleHub API, specifically the 'unsdsn/world-happiness' dataset from the HUGGING_FACE adapter.",
  "sources": "Import statements for kagglehub and KaggleDatasetAdapter; dataset_load function call with dataset name and version",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output dataset details, which could potentially reveal dataset size or content",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> dataset_load with specified adapter and dataset name -> printing dataset info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; use of a standard dataset loading process; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library, uses a known API to load a publicly available dataset, and prints dataset metadata. No obfuscated code, no data exfiltration, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are present. The dataset is public, and the code simply retrieves and displays information.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward dataset loading script without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious anomalies.",
