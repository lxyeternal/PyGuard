  "purpose": "The code loads a dataset from Kaggle using a custom module 'kagglehub' and prints information about the dataset.",
  "sources": "Dataset load function, import statements",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting dataset information",
  "flows": "Input data from KaggleHub dataset loader -> Output via print statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The module 'kagglehub' is assumed to be a legitimate dataset handler; no external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and uses a dataset load function to fetch a dataset named 'unsdsn/world-happiness' from the 'HUGGING_FACE' adapter. It then prints the number of records and the dataset object. No user inputs, no data leaks, or malicious code constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for dataset loading. There is no evidence of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior in the provided snippets.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply loads and displays a dataset without performing any suspicious or malicious actions. No security risks or malware indications are detected based on this code snippet.",
