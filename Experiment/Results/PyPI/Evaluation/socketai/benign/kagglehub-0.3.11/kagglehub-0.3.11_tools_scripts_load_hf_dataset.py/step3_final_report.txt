{
  "purpose": "The code loads a dataset ('unsdsn/world-happiness' for 2016) using a custom library 'kagglehub' and prints dataset metadata.",
  "sources": "dataset_load() function call with dataset identifier and file name; dataset.num_rows attribute; print statements",
  "sinks": "print statements outputting dataset info; no untrusted data sinks or network operations present",
  "flows": "Input parameters to dataset_load() from the dataset identifier and filename; dataset attributes accessed for output",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-standard library 'kagglehub' without verification; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward dataset loading and display operation. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is detected. The only concern is the use of a non-standard library, which warrants verification but does not imply malicious intent. The dataset source is public, and the operations are benign. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score low (~0.1-0.2) due to reliance on an external library. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, performs a standard dataset load, and shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at 0. Verification of the 'kagglehub' library source is recommended but outside static analysis scope.",
