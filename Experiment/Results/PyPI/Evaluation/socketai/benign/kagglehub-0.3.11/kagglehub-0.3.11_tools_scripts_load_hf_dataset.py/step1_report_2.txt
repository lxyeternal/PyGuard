{
  "purpose": "The code loads a specific dataset ('unsdsn/world-happiness' for 2016) from Kaggle using the kagglehub library, then prints the number of records and dataset details.",
  "sources": "The dataset identifier 'unsdsn/world-happiness' and the file name '2016.csv' used in the dataset_load function.",
  "sinks": "The print statements output dataset information; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from the dataset source via kagglehub.dataset_load, then its properties are accessed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Usage of external library functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library and uses it to load a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset identifier and file name appear typical for dataset retrieval. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations detected. The dataset_load function's source and its parameters are straightforward, and the output is purely informational. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or system interference are evident. The code is simple and aligns with standard data loading procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard dataset retrieval and display operations without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for data analysis workflows.",
