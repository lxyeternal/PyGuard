  "flows": "Download scripts from repositories -> save to cache -> optionally add to sys.path -> verify files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that downloads scripts, verifies their presence, and modifies sys.path accordingly. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The main security consideration is the dynamic addition of external scripts to sys.path, which could be exploited if the sources are compromised. However, in the context of controlled tests, this is standard practice. The code does not perform any malicious actions itself, and the network interactions are limited to fetching scripts from specified repositories. The tests include error handling for non-existent scripts, ensuring robustness. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for script download and import behavior, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious scripts to be downloaded and added to sys.path, but this risk is inherent in dynamic code loading and is not evidenced here. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic external script inclusion in a controlled testing environment.",
