{
  "purpose": "This code defines unit tests for the utility_script_install function, verifying its behavior with various inputs and scenarios.",
  "sources": "Input data is from function parameters, and the creation of test cache context, which likely involves temporary filesystem or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modification (adding/removing response paths), file system assertions, and HTTPError exception handling.",
  "flows": "The utility_script_install function fetches scripts or resources based on input strings, which then influence sys.path modifications or file presence assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No suspicious code patterns or hidden behaviors observed. Use of standard testing patterns and external libraries appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing for a utility script installer, including network fetch simulations and filesystem checks. sys.path is temporarily modified but properly cleaned up. No suspicious or malicious activity detected, as it appears to only test expected functionality. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data flows identified. All actions are consistent with typical testing routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for the utility_script_install function. It performs no malicious actions, does not contain malware, and poses no security risks beyond typical testing environment considerations. It is safe for use.",
