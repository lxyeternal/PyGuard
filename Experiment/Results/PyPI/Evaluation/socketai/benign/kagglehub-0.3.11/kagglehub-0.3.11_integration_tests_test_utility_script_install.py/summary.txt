  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for script download and import behavior, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious scripts to be downloaded and added to sys.path, but this risk is inherent in dynamic code loading and is not evidenced here. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic external script inclusion in a controlled testing environment."
