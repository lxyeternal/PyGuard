The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at 0. Verification of the 'kagglehub' library source is recommended but outside static analysis scope."

The security risk is minimal, primarily due to network activity inherent in download operations, which is justified and not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the minor external network interactions. These scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code."

The primary security concern is the potential for malicious scripts to be downloaded and added to sys.path, but this risk is inherent in dynamic code loading and is not evidenced here. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of dynamic external script inclusion in a controlled testing environment."

Other reports show benign patterns with low malware and risk scores. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary."
