  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or visible in the snippet, so the intended functionality cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from environment variables and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include network requests and possibly file operations, depending on further code context.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input parameters flows into functions that may perform network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or malicious code constructs are visible; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data from environment variables and parameters, then processes this data within functions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. Without additional code, no malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and benign. Confidence is moderate due to lack of complete context.",
