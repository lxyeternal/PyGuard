  "purpose": "Unit tests for downloading notebook outputs from Kaggle using the kagglehub package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for unittest, requests.HTTPError, kagglehub.notebook_output_download, and local utils functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to external systems or uses untrusted input in sensitive operations; it primarily calls a download function and asserts file existence.",
  "flows": "Test functions call notebook_output_download with specific handles and optional paths, then verify downloaded files via assert_files. No untrusted data flow detected outside test parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors observed. The code is straightforward unit testing of expected functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple unit tests for notebook output downloads, covering both public and private notebooks, versioned and unversioned, with handling of errors. The download function is called with controlled parameters, and results are checked against expected files. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input beyond test data, and no suspicious logic are present. Use of external libraries appears normal. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for verifying notebook output download functionality. It does not contain malware or security risks. It performs no harmful actions, no data leakage, and no malicious behavior.",
