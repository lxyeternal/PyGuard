  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for rendering and processing parameters, such as thresholds, verbosity levels, DPI, threading, and reporting limits.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments within the code, no external input or data handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration values.",
  "flows": "N/A — static assignments with no data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments setting configuration parameters. There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code is clear, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
