  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code only defines constants related to configuration, with no external data handling or suspicious constructs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is benign, purely defining constants. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no external input, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, indicating benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and justified. The constants are standard configuration parameters with no malicious implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—constants for rendering/processing, no external data, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, indicating benign configuration.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's simplicity. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, straightforward configuration constants, no input or output operations.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—configuration constants with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zeros.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code only defines constants related to rendering or processing configurations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero in all cases, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a simple, static set of configuration constants with no external data handling, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\nThis aligns with the analysis, confirming that the code is benign configuration data with no security concerns.",
