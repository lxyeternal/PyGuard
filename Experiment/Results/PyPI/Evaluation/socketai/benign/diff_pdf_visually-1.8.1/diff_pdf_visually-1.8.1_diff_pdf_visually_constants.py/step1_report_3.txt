{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a processing or rendering system, such as setting thresholds, verbosity levels, resolution, and threading options.",
  "sources": "Assignment of constant values and configuration parameters, no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data processing, input/output, or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or external systems; the code is purely defining constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The code appears to be straightforward configuration variable definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets various constants for thresholds, verbosity levels, rendering DPI, and threading. All values are hardcoded literals with no dynamic or external input. No functions, user input, or external data sources are involved. The structure is simple and clear, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger application where these constants are used for processing or rendering tasks.",
