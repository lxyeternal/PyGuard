  "purpose": "Define constants and default configuration parameters for a PDF processing or rendering application.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code only sets constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; standard configuration variable definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments establishing constants and configuration options related to rendering and processing settings, such as infinity representation, thresholds, verbosity levels, DPI, threading, and reporting limits. No input reading, data processing, or external interaction mechanisms are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malware-related patterns.",
