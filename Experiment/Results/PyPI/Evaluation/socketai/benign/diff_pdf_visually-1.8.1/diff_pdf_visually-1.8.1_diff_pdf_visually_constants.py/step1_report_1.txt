{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants for configuration and control parameters used in a larger application, likely related to rendering or processing pages with adjustable verbosity and thresholds.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned values directly in the code; no external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or leaks detected.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious constructs identified. The constants are typical configuration values.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for configuration constants used in a processing context (possibly PDF or document rendering). No external data input, no command execution, and no suspicious logic. No indications of obfuscation, malicious intent, or malicious behavior. The constants appear to be standard configuration parameters for controlling verbosity, thresholds, and rendering settings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign; it only establishes configuration constants for a larger application. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
