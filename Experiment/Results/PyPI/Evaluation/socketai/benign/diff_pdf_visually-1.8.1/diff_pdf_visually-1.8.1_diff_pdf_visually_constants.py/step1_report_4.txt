  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a PDF processing or rendering application.",
  "sources": "None, the code only sets static variables; no input or external data is read.",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data handling or data output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only declares constants and configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be straightforward configuration setup with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes several constants related to rendering or processing settings such as infinity, thresholds, verbosity levels, DPI, thread count, and reporting limits. There are no input or output operations, no use of environment variables, and no complex logic or dynamic code execution. The constants are clearly documented and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns. Overall, this appears to be a benign configuration module for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe configuration setup with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not perform any data processing or I/O operations that could be exploited.",
