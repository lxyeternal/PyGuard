  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a PDF rendering or processing application.",
  "sources": "Constants are set directly within the code; no external data input is read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted in a manner that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; constants are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; all variables are straightforward constants. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines constants for application configuration, such as thresholds, verbosity levels, DPI settings, threading options, and report limits. There is no evidence of input handling, data manipulation, or any potentially malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity can be inferred. The structure and format are clear and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving as configuration parameter definitions for an application. It does not contain malware or security risks based on its content.",
