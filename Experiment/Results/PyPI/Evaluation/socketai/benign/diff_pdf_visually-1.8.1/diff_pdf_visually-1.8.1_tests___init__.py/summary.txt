  "conclusion": "Most reports indicate low to moderate suspicion, with only report 5 showing strong indicators of malicious activity such as dynamic code execution with untrusted input and network communication. The scores are generally appropriate and justified based on the described behaviors. No major revisions are necessary; the evaluations align with standard security assessment practices."
