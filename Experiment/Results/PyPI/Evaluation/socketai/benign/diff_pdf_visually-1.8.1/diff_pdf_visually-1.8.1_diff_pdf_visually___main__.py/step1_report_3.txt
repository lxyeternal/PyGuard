  "purpose": "Command-line utility for comparing two PDF files visually with configurable sensitivity and output options.",
  "sources": "Arguments parsing for input PDF paths ('a', 'b'), and optional parameters such as --silent, --verbose, --threshold, --dpi, --outdir, --time, --version; data read from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() calls with exit codes based on comparison results; print statements for warnings.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> parsing and validation -> calling pdf_similar() with parameters -> exit code based on comparison result.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assert statements for argument validation, which can be disabled with optimization flags, potentially bypassing some checks; no evidence of hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network or system modification activities present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard command-line interface script that processes user inputs to compare PDFs. It includes argument validation, verbosity control, and calls an external function pdf_similar() for the core comparison task. There are no suspicious data flows, hidden code, or obfuscated sections. The only minor concern is the reliance on assert statements for validation, which could be disabled, but this does not appear to introduce malicious behavior. No indications of malware, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign PDF comparison utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard argument parsing and external library functions for core functionality. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware indicators are detected.",
