  "purpose": "A test suite for the 'diff_pdf_visually' library functions, verifying PDF comparison features using static test files and temporary directories.",
  "sources": "Reads static PDF files from 'tests/' directory; creates temporary directories for output files.",
  "sinks": "Writes output images and logs to temporary directories; no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads PDFs -> processes with library functions -> outputs images/logs in temp directories.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite that performs assertions on PDF comparison functions using static files and temporary directories. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input. The functions used are standard and presumed safe. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scoring is appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain 0, and the security risk score can be set to 0 for an even more accurate reflection of its safety.",
