  "purpose": "Module setup for PDF comparison utilities, defining version and importing functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module (.diff), version string definition.",
  "sinks": "None in this code fragment; no data or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements and metadata definition; no data flow or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and metadata setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module initializer with version info and function imports. No input/output, system calls, or data processing occurs here. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The imported functions could pose risks if misused elsewhere, but within this fragment, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward module setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
