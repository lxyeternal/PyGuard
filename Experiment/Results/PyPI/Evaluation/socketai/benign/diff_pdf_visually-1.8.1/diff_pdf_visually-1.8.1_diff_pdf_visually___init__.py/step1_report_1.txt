{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to compare PDFs visually using ImageMagick and pdftocairo, likely for testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module (.diff) and the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; the code primarily sets up imports and versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a version string, import statements for type annotations, and imports of functions from a local module. There are no user inputs, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. All imported functions appear related to PDF comparison tasks, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to serve as an interface or utility module for PDF comparison. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks within this limited fragment.",
