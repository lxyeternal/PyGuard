  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network/file outputs, data processing functions, system calls, external library usage.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, data transmission, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into processing functions, potentially leading to network transmission, file writes, or environment modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code snippets, relying on descriptions. The assessments correctly assign low malware scores (0) due to no evidence of malicious activity. Confidence levels vary but are appropriate given the limited information. Security risk scores are generally low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern; minor overestimation in some cases (e.g., reports 3 and 5) where a score of 0.1 might be more precise. Obfuscation scores are consistently 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation indicators. The reasoning across reports is cautious, consistent, and justified, with no overestimations or contradictions.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are appropriately cautious, with scores reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, though slightly conservative in some cases. Overall, the assessments are consistent, accurate, and do not require adjustments.",
