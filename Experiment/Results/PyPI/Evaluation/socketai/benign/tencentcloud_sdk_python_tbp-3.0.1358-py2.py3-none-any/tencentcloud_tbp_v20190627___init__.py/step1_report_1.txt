{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some operation that involves importing modules and possibly executing dynamic code or handling data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, environment variables, and potentially from user inputs or external data sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic execution functions like eval() or exec(), network calls, file writing/reading, or system commands if used within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions, possibly reaching dangerous functions like eval() or network modules.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution found; however, without explicit code, this is a low-confidence observation.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review cannot be completed without the actual code content. Based on the prompt, no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident. The structure appears standard. The absence of visible eval(), exec(), or network calls suggests low malicious activity, but a lack of code limits confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on available information. However, due to the absence of concrete code, this assessment has low confidence.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
