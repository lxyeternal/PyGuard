{
  "purpose": "Define constant error codes and messages for internal application errors and parameter issues.",
  "sources": "Constants are defined at the beginning of the code, no input reading present.",
  "targets": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leak or effect points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only constant definitions and licensing comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions representing error codes and messages, with licensing and copyright comments. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase for error handling, but by itself, it shows no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining constants for error handling with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for error message management.",
