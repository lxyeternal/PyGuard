  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature:**\n   - The code is a set of static string constants defining various internal error codes and messages.\n   - It contains no functions, no data input/output, no dynamic behavior.\n   - The licensing comments are standard, and variable naming is clear.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a constants module.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n   - The malware score assigned as 0 in all reports aligns with this assessment.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - No dynamic code execution, no external data handling, no input validation, or data leaks.\n   - The code's purpose is straightforward error code definitions, which are common in software projects.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified based solely on this snippet.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — the code is not obfuscated.\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — given the above, the security risk is negligible.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or issues in the reports?**\n   - All reports are consistent in their analysis: they correctly identify the code as benign, static, and non-malicious.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n   - No need to adjust the scores or conclusions.\n\n6. **Additional considerations:**\n   - Since this is a small, isolated constants file, the main concern is whether it is part of a larger malicious package. However, based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence to suggest malicious intent.\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is a benign, straightforward constants module defining internal error codes. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores and conclusions in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nNo changes needed. The code is safe and standard for error handling in software systems.",
