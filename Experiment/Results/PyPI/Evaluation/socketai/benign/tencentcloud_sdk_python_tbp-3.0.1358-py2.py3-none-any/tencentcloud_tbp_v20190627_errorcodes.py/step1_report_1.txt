{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of constant string error codes for internal errors and parameter errors, likely used for error handling in an application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; these are static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; constants are used internally within an application.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code simply declares constants without dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string constant definitions representing error codes for various internal error types and parameter issues. There are no functions, no external data inputs, and no dynamic code execution. The structure indicates it is part of a larger error handling module. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The licensing comments are standard, and the variable naming is clear and descriptive.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions for error codes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
