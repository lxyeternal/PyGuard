  "purpose": "Defines internal error codes and messages for error handling within a system.",
  "sources": "Static string constants assigned to variables representing error codes and messages.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow, as the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining various internal error codes and messages. It contains no functions, data processing, external data input, or dynamic behavior. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate any malicious intent. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious constructs. Given its static nature, it poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign, straightforward purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constants module for error codes, with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
