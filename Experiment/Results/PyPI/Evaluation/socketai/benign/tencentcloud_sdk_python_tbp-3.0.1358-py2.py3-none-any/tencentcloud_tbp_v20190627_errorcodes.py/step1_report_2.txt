  "purpose": "Define error codes and messages for internal system errors and parameter issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static code defining constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string definitions for various error conditions related to internal errors, permission issues, and parameter validation. No input reading, data processing, or external communication is present. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or sabotage. The structure is straightforward, and the licensing comments are standard. The code appears to be a simple constants module for error messaging.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of constant definitions for error codes with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
