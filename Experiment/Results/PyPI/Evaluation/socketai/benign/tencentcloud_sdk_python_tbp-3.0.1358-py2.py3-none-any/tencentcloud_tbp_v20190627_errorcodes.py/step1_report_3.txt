  "purpose": "Define internal error constants for a service or application, likely used for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present; this is a static constants definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input/output, or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present; the code is straightforward and consists of constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string constants representing error codes, with licensing information and no dynamic or external data interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The purpose appears to be to standardize error messages for internal use within an application or service.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple definition of error code constants with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
