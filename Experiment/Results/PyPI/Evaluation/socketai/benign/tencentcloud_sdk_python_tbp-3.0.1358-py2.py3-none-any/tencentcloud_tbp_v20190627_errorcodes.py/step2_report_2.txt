  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static string constants defining internal error codes.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**:\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause security issues.\n   - The license comments are standard, and variable naming is clear.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Security risk is 0, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence is high (1), as the analysis is thorough and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores assigned are consistent and reasonable given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely a constants module, it cannot be malicious on its own.\n   - The only potential concern would be if this code were maliciously injected into a larger project, but based solely on this snippet, there's no indication of that.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, static constants module defining error codes with no malicious or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
