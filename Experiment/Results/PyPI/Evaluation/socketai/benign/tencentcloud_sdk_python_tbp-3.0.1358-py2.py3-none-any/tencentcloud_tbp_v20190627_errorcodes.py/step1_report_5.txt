{
  "purpose": "Define and document internal error codes and messages for a Tencent-based application or service.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string definitions of error codes and messages at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external interactions occur in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only contains static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for defining constants.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string variable definitions representing various internal error codes and messages. These are static constants meant for internal use within a larger application. There are no input sources, external data handling, or potential injection points. No dynamic execution or suspicious constructs are present. It is a simple, well-documented constants module, with license headers and comments. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a basic constants definition module for internal error messages. It appears benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a standard implementation for managing error codes in software systems.",
