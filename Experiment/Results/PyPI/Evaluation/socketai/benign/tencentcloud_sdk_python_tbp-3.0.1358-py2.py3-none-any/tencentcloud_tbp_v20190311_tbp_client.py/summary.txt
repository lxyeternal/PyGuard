  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK client wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external network communication, which is typical for SDKs. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting low inherent risk. No modifications are necessary based on this review."
