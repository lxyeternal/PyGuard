  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a metadata header containing licensing information and a version identifier for the software package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from the static comments and the assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is purely static metadata with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header and version declaration with no executable logic, network activity, or embedded secrets. It contains only comments and a simple variable assignment, which are typical in open-source projects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores of malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the benign nature of this snippet. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as metadata with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
