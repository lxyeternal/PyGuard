{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a metadata header for a Python package or module, primarily containing licensing information and versioning.",
  "sources": "The source is the header comments and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only contains comments and a version string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code consists of standard licensing comments and a version variable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard license header with a version variable assignment, common in open-source packages. There are no functions, input handling, or executable logic that could be malicious. The comments specify licensing terms but do not introduce any executable or malicious behavior. The version variable '__version__' is assigned a string value, which is typical for package metadata. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment contains only licensing comments and a version declaration, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign header for a Python package or module.",
