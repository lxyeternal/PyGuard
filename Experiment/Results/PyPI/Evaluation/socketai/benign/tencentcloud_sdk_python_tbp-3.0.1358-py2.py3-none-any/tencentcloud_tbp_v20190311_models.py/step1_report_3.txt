{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling requests and responses related to chatbot operations, including creation, resetting, and message processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from external callers (e.g., params dictionary in _deserialize methods), environment variables, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; data flows are within class property assignments and deserialization methods, with no evident data leaks or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from params -> class properties via _deserialize methods -> potentially used in API responses or further processing; no external data sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; use of warnings.warn for unused parameters is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for request/response data models.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes inheriting from AbstractModel, used for request and response data encapsulation. Each class contains property getters/setters and a _deserialize method to populate class attributes from a dictionary. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated logic. The code uses standard warnings for extra parameters, which is common in SDKs. There are no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external module usage beyond the imported common module, and no dynamic execution. Overall, the code functions as structured data models without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard boilerplate for SDK data models used in chatbot API interactions. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It appears safe and correctly implemented for its purpose.",
