{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for a chatbot API, handling request and response structures, including session management, message groups, and slot information.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for various request classes such as CreateBotRequest, ResetRequest, TextProcessRequest, and their deserialization methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that execute untrusted data directly, such as system commands or network calls within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., API requests) into class attributes via deserialization; no direct external data flows or processing are visible in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code strictly defines data structures with no dynamic execution or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for modeling request and response data, with properties and deserialization methods. It does not include any code execution, network operations, or data processing logic that could be malicious. The presence of license and import statements is standard. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely structural, defining data models for a chatbot API. It contains no malicious behavior, no external network or file operations, and no hidden or suspicious code. The risk of supply chain malware is extremely low.",
