  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident; the code does not read user input, environment variables, or external data streams.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to files and prints output; no external network connections or sensitive data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "No clear untrusted data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code contains standard function definitions and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured with defined functions performing specific tasks. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are present. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious network activity, or system harm. Usage of libraries appears standard and appropriate. No secrets or credentials are embedded, and control flow seems typical. Without external context, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems safe and standard in its operations.",
