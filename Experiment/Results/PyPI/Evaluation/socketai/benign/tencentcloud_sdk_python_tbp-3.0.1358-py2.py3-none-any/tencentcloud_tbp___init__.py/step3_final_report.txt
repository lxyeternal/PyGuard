  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, file system, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), misleading variable names.",
  "sinks": "File writes, system commands, network communications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, args) potentially flow into system/network operations; obfuscated/dynamic code may conceal malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic execution, misleading variable names, lack of code in some reports, potential concealment tactics.",
  "analysis": "The code in the most suspicious report (Report 2) exhibits high obfuscation (score 0.7) and signs of dynamic execution, which raises suspicion but lacks concrete malicious indicators. Other reports show straightforward, benign code with no obfuscation or malicious signs. The scores assigned are generally consistent with the descriptions; minor adjustments could be made to the malware score in Report 2, increasing it slightly to 0.3 due to the obfuscation, but 0.2 remains cautious and acceptable. Overall, the risk scores align with the suspicion levels, and the low malware scores reflect the absence of confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are appropriate; the high obfuscation in Report 2 warrants a slightly higher malware suspicion, but overall, the code appears benign. No significant changes are necessary; the scores are justified and consistent with the evidence.",
