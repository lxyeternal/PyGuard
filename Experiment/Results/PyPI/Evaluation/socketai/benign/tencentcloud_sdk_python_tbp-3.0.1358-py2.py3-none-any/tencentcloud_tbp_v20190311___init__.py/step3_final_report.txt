{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script with no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data, processes variables, and possibly interacts with the environment in a straightforward manner.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections or file operations if present, but none are detected or implied.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs or external interactions, none of which show malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Confidence is high (0.9). No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The security risk is minimal (0.1), consistent with benign code. The code's simplicity and lack of anomalies support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
