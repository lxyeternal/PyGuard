  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a Python script for general data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data is read from standard input, environment variables, and possibly from external modules or files, though no specific input sources are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly present or used unsafely in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through various functions and computations, but no untrusted data paths to risky operations are clearly identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. Usage of dynamic features or obfuscated code is not apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python functions and control flow structures with typical usage patterns. No external library misuse, unsafe evaluations, or malicious patterns are detected. The structure is straightforward, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are apparent upon review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no identifiable supply chain threats or security issues.",
