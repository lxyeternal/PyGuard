  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK client with no malicious intent or suspicious elements. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The minimal security risk score reflects typical API client interaction, assuming secure implementation of the external call(). Overall, the supply chain security posture is high, with no detected threats."
