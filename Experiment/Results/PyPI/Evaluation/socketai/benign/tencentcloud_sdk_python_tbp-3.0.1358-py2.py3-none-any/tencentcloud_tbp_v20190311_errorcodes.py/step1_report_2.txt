{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing internal error codes and parameter errors, likely used for error handling in an application or API.",
  "sources": "These constants are assigned string literals directly in the code, no external data sources or input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data or external outputs. The code only declares constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the constants are static and do not process dynamic data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only string constant declarations with no complex logic, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The presence of detailed error code strings is normal for logging purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of error code constants, including internal errors and parameter validation errors, used for consistent error reporting. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. It lacks external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code features. The comments and structure indicate standard practice for error handling in software modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, serving as a static set of error code constants without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing or external interactions, thus poses no security threat.",
