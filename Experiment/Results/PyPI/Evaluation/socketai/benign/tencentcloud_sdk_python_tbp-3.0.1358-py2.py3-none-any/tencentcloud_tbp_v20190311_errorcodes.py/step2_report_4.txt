  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is simply a static declaration of string constants representing error codes and messages. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or external calls. The code appears benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is static and non-malicious. They do not identify any logical flaws or suspicious patterns. The reasoning is consistent and aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n   Since the code is purely static constants with no external interactions, these scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   The reports do not assign any risk scores above 0.5, which is correct. The code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that there is no malware activity. The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious code snippets, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is standard for error code definitions and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports, and they reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and static nature of this code, there is no indication of any security threat. The code is a typical pattern for defining error codes in software systems.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent. The code is benign, and no further security concerns are warranted based on this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0",
