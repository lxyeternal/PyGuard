{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants for internal error codes and error messages used within an application or SDK, likely related to Tencent services.",
  "sources": "These constants are predefined string variables representing various error conditions, not reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code, as it does not process untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of string constants for error codes and messages. It does not include any dynamic code, input handling, or external calls. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for managing error states. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present, and the structure is simple and standard for such definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious set of error code constants. It contains no suspicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger SDK or application that handles error reporting.",
