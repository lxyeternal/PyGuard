{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of error codes and messages for internal errors and invalid parameters, likely used for error handling in a larger system or API.",
  "sources": "The code contains only constant definitions of string variables assigned to specific error code messages.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs, no external data flows, and no execution based on user input.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code only declares static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be standard error code definitions.",
  "analysis": "The file consists solely of string constant definitions representing various internal error codes and messages. No dynamic code, user inputs, or external calls are present. It serves as a static resource for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static error code declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is benign and appears to be part of a larger application infrastructure.",
