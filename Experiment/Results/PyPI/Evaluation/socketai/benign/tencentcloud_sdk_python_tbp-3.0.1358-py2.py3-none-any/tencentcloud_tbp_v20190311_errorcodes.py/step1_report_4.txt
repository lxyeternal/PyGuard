{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of error code constants related to internal errors and invalid parameters for a software system, likely used for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string definitions for error codes within the source file.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; these are static constant definitions used elsewhere in the system.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is a straightforward declaration of constants. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static string assignments for error codes with descriptive identifiers. It includes licensing information and comments, but no dynamic or external data processing. The structure is simple, with no input/output operations or code execution mechanisms. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign snippet defining error constants for internal use. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
