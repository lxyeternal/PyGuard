  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely static constant definitions for error codes and messages.\n   - No dynamic operations, input handling, external calls, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for error handling modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they do not overlook any malicious or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident, as the code is purely declarative.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores reflect the benign nature of the code accurately.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware score as 0, consistent with the code's static, non-executable nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on static analysis and conclude benign intent.\n   - This is appropriate given the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a simple, static set of error code constants.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is benign and safe.",
