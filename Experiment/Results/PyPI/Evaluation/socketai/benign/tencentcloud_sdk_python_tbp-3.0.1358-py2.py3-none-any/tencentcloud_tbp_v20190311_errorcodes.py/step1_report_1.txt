{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of string constants representing internal error codes and parameter errors, likely for an API or SDK error handling framework.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from static constant definitions within the source file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines static strings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external input to any sensitive sink; the code merely provides constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constant definitions for error codes, with descriptive comments. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or external calls. The structure appears standard for error code management in software systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple definition of error code constants with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated elements.",
