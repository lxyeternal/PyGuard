  "purpose": "Defines static error code constants for error handling and messaging within a system.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static string constants are predefined in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only static definitions without dynamic data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of static string constants representing various internal error codes and messages. It contains no dynamic operations, input handling, external calls, or obfuscation. The code is purely declarative, serving as a resource for error reporting. No malicious, suspicious, or security-compromising behavior is present. The consistency across multiple reports confirms the benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified given the static, non-executable nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of error code definitions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current assessment and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
