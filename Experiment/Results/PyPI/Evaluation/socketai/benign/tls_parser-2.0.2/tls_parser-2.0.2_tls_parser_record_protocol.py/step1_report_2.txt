{
  "purpose": "The code implements parsing and serialization of TLS record headers and messages, likely for a network protocol analysis or inspection tool.",
  "sources": "Input data for from_bytes methods, specifically raw_bytes representing TLS records.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code primarily parses data rather than executing or outputting untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input raw_bytes -> TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes() -> TlsRecord.from_bytes() -> TlsSubprotocolMessage -> to_bytes methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of standard library functions and known enum patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and classes for parsing TLS record headers and messages, including handling of TLS versions and record types. It correctly checks input length, handles exceptions for unknown version bytes, and adheres to TLS protocol structure. No suspicious data handling or unusual patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation for TLS record parsing without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical TLS record parser implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It reads input data, processes it safely, and provides serialization functions. There is no evidence of malware or malicious data leakage in this code.",
