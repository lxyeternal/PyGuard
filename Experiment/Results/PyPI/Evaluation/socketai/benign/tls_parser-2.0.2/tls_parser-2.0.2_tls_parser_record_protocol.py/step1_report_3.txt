{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse, represent, and serialize TLS record headers and subprotocol messages, supporting TLS version identification and handling different record types.",
  "sources": "Data is read from bytes in the from_bytes methods, specifically from raw_bytes parameters, which are supposed to contain TLS record data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that handle untrusted data directly leading to data leaks or malicious actions. It primarily processes TLS record bytes internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input bytes into record header parsing, then into message creation, and potentially back into serialized form via to_bytes methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard with proper exception handling for insufficient data and unknown types/versions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly parses TLS record headers by verifying lengths, record types, and TLS versions with appropriate exception handling. It encapsulates TLS data into objects, supports serialization, and restricts multiple messages in non-handshake records, aligning with TLS protocol expectations. There are no evident malicious patterns, backdoors, or security flaws in the parsing logic. No external data or environment variables are used unsafely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured TLS record parser implementation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected operations without suspicious behaviors or hidden malicious functions.",
