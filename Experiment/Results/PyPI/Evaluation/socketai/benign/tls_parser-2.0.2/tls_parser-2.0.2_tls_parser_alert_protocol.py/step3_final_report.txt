{
  "purpose": "This code implements TLS alert message and record handling, including parsing from bytes and constructing messages from parameters, following standard protocol practices.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from raw_bytes during parsing, constructs alert messages from parameters during creation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input data is parsed but not directly used in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: raw_bytes input; flow: parsing functions extract data, which is then used to instantiate message objects; no external data sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The alert_description is stored as an integer, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard TLS alert message parsing and serialization using struct, with appropriate length checks and type validation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Exception handling is in place for insufficient data and unexpected record types. The implementation aligns with typical protocol handling patterns. The code does not perform network operations, secret management, or dynamic code execution. The alert_description is stored as an integer, consistent with protocol specifications. Overall, the code is straightforward, correct, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of TLS alert message handling with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified. The code should be considered safe for use within its intended context.",
