{
  "purpose": "Defines TLS alert message and record structures for parsing and creation of TLS alert protocol messages.",
  "sources": "Input bytes for parsing in from_bytes methods, alert_severity and alert_description parameters for creation.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; no external data output, no untrusted data used in dangerous contexts.",
  "flows": "from_bytes methods parse input data; from_parameters methods create alert messages; properties access subprotocol message data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code behavior. Use of struct for packing data is standard; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs. The alert_description is stored as an int, but that is typical for protocol code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements TLS alert message and record handling, with input parsing and message creation functions. It performs validation on input length, checks for correct record type, and unpacks data using struct. No external network operations, system modifications, or data leaks are present. The code does not handle any secrets or sensitive info beyond protocol-level data, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is observed. The code appears to be standard protocol handling logic, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of TLS alert message parsing and creation. It follows standard practices for protocol message handling without suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
