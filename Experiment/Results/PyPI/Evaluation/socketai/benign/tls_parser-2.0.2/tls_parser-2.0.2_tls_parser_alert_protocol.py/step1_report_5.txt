  "purpose": "Define classes for handling TLS alert messages and records, including serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input bytes for parsing TLS records and messages.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input data from raw_bytes used in from_bytes methods.",
  "flows": "raw_bytes -> TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes -> TlsAlertMessage.from_bytes -> TlsAlertRecord",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs straightforward parsing and object construction.",
  "analysis": "The code defines TLS alert message and record classes, providing methods for creating and parsing these objects. It uses struct for byte packing/unpacking and handles expected exceptions. No network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution features are present. No suspicious or obfuscated logic detected. Usage of external modules is standard for TLS parsing. The code mainly processes data in a controlled manner without any hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for TLS alert message handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It focuses on data parsing and object representation without any suspicious behavior.",
