{
  "purpose": "Define and handle TLS alert messages and records, including serialization and deserialization from bytes.",
  "sources": "Input data: raw_bytes parameter in from_bytes methods, possibly from network or file; also data used in struct.pack/unpack.",
  "sinks": "Return values and properties exposing alert severity and description; potentially used downstream for security alerts or logging.",
  "flows": "raw_bytes -> parse header and message -> create alert message object -> produce alert record -> access properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. No use of unsafe code patterns or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with parsing and constructing TLS alert messages. It uses standard library functions such as struct.pack and struct.unpack for serialization/deserialization, with no evident malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network communication, or suspicious dynamic execution is present. It assumes well-formed input and correctly raises exceptions on invalid data. Overall, the implementation appears safe and standard for TLS protocol handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of TLS alert message parsing and construction, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a component for handling TLS alerts in a larger TLS protocol context. The code is clean, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.",
