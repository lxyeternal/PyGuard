  "purpose": "Define and parse TLS alert messages and records for TLS protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "Code reads from input bytes when parsing raw TLS record data via from_bytes methods, and constructs message objects with provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data is evident; the code mainly constructs objects from input bytes and parameters.",
  "flows": "Input bytes flow from from_bytes methods into message and record objects; parameters flow into constructors to create alert messages and records.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL, or unusual data handling. The code appears to perform standard TLS message parsing and construction without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for TLS alert message and record handling, including parsing from bytes and constructing messages from parameters. It uses standard struct packing for message serialization. There are no indications of data leakage, insecure data handling, or malicious behavior. All input handling is limited to parsing and constructing objects, with proper exception raising on insufficient data or type mismatches. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears consistent with expected TLS protocol processing, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard TLS alert message and record handler with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical serialization and deserialization operations necessary for TLS protocol implementation, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
