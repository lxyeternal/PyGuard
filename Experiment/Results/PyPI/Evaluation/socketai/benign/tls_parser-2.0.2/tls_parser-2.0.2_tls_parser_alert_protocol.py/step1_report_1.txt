  "purpose": "Defines TLS alert message and record classes for parsing and creating TLS alert protocol messages.",
  "sources": "Reads raw bytes for parsing alert messages and headers; uses struct.pack/unpack for serialization/deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Creates alert messages from bytes; constructs record headers and messages from parameters.",
  "flows": "from_bytes() reads raw bytes -> parses header and alert message -> constructs alert record; from_parameters() creates alert message and header -> constructs alert record.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated code. No external network activity or file operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code handles TLS alert message parsing and creation using standard struct packing/unpacking. It validates message length and type but does not process untrusted input beyond parsing, nor does it perform any network or file I/O. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The code appears straightforward, with clear and standard implementation for TLS alert handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for TLS alert message handling with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly manages TLS alert parsing and creation without external or suspicious operations.",
