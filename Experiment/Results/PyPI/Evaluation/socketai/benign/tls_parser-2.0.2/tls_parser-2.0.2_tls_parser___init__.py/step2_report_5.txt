  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple metadata variable assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__) with comments referencing an SSL/TLS traffic analysis blog.\n- The code snippets are straightforward, with no dynamic behavior, no input/output, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The comments referencing external blogs are benign and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code matches the description: it only assigns static string values to module-level variables.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present.\n- The references to SSL/TLS traffic analysis are only in comments and do not influence code behavior.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, with no security concerns.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in these reports.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, and the code is just static metadata, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unwarranted.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is correct.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The only potential concern could be the comments referencing SSL/TLS analysis, but these are just comments and do not imply any malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious code are supported by the provided snippets.\n\n**Consistency check:**\n- All scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely metadata with no executable logic, network activity, or suspicious features. The comments are benign references to external content. Therefore, the scores reflect no security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.",
