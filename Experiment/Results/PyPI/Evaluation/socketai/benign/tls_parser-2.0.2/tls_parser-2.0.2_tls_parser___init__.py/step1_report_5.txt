{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__) for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "The source reads are from the assignment statements defining version, author, and email metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code segment, as it does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets (beyond standard metadata), or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains straightforward variable assignments for package metadata and a comment referencing an external blog post. There are no dynamic or untrusted data inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code behavior. The structure is simple and typical for Python package metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as metadata annotations for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
