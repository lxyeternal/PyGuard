  "purpose": "Define module metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__) and include a comment referencing an external SSL/TLS traffic analysis blog.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__), comment referencing external blog.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, input/output, or network activity.",
  "flows": "None; code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains only metadata and a benign comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string variable assignments for module metadata and a comment referencing an external SSL/TLS analysis blog. There are no dynamic operations, data flows, network activity, or executable logic. The comment is benign and informational. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is standard for Python modules and serves as metadata only. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence score of 1 reflects certainty in this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, consisting solely of module metadata with a benign comment. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
