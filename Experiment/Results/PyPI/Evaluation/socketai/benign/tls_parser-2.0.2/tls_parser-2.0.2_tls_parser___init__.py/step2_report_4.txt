  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static variable assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__) and a comment linking to an external blog post about SSL/TLS session analysis.\n   - There are no data flows, no input/output operations, no dynamic code, and no executable logic.\n   - The comment referencing traffic analysis is benign and unrelated to the code's behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious variables.\n   - No hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata.\n   - No external data fetching, network activity, or executable logic.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and purely metadata.\n   - No logical errors or overestimations are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The malware scores are 0, consistent with the code's content.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, as expected.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Adjustments:**\n   - Since the code is entirely benign, no adjustments to scores are necessary.\n   - The external comment about SSL/TLS analysis does not impact security but could be considered irrelevant or distracting; however, it does not influence the security assessment.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is standard metadata for a Python module.\n   - No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n   - The references to external blogs are benign and informational.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. No modifications are necessary. The code is harmless, serving only as module metadata with a non-intrusive comment.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign an overall estimate based on all reports, I would concur with the existing scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
