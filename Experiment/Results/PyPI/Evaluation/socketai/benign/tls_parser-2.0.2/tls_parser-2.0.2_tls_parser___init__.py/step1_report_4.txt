  "purpose": "Define metadata for the Python module, including version, author, and contact email.",
  "sources": "Module-level assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only assigns string literals to variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; static metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or malicious code; only metadata variables assigned static strings. Comment referencing traffic analysis blog unrelated to code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only simple variable assignments for module metadata, with no input processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The comment referencing SSL/TLS traffic analysis appears unrelated to any operational code. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, the code is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves to specify module information and contains no harmful instructions.",
