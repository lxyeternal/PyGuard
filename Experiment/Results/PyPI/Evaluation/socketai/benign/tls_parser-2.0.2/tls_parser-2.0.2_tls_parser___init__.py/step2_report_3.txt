  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple metadata variable assignments (__version__, __author__, __email__) with a comment linking to an SSL/TLS analysis blog.\n- No input/output, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code are identified.\n- The comment referencing SSL/TLS traffic analysis appears unrelated to the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code only assigns static string variables and contains a benign comment. No malicious or suspicious code is present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and metadata-only.  \n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of behavior.\n\n### Justifications for risk scores:\n- The code is purely static metadata with no dynamic or executable parts.\n- The comment about SSL/TLS analysis is irrelevant to code behavior and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The mention of the SSL/TLS blog is just a comment and does not imply any malicious or obfuscated activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a simple, static metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious features. The comment referencing SSL/TLS analysis is benign and unrelated to code execution or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
