{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __email__) for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "The variables are assigned string values directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data or external input is used or manipulated.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual behavior; it is simple metadata assignment. The comment references SSL/TLS traffic analysis but does not execute or include any related code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets three string variables representing version, author, and email information. There is no dynamic code, no data input, no network activity, and no executable logic. The comment provides a link to a traffic analysis blog but does not indicate any malicious intent or behavior. Overall, this appears to be standard module metadata with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata for a Python module. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
