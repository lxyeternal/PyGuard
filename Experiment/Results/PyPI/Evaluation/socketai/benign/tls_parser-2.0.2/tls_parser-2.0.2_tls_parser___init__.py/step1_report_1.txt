  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata for a Python module, including version, author, and email, and includes a comment about an external webpage related to SSL/TLS session analysis.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as the code only contains metadata and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no suspicious variables, hidden code, or unusual language features. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module metadata assignments and a comment. No data input, network activity, or executable logic exists. The comment references an external blog post about SSL/TLS traffic analysis, but this does not affect the current code's behavior or security.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and contains only standard metadata and comments. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
