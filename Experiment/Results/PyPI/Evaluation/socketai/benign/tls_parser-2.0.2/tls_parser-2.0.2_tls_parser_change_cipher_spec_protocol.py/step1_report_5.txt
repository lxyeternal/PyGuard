The class methods are straightforward and typical.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code defines a class inheriting from TlsRecord, with methods to instantiate TLS Change Cipher Spec records. It uses a fixed byte '\\x01' for the message, which aligns with protocol standards. The from_bytes method is unimplemented, indicating no processing of external data for this record type. No dynamic execution, no suspicious data handling, and no external data sources are involved. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation for TLS record creation without malicious intent or security risks.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"This code segment appears benign, implementing standard TLS record handling with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It does not process untrusted input maliciously nor contains any suspicious or malicious code. It is likely a part of a larger, legitimate TLS parser implementation.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0\n}",
