{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for representing a TLS Change Cipher Spec record with methods to instantiate from parameters or bytes.",
  "sources": "None (no input data sources other than the method parameters).",
  "sinks": "None (no data is sent or written to external systems or outputs).",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard class definition with no signs of unusual behavior or obfuscation. The method from_bytes raises NotImplementedError, which is typical for unimplemented parsing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of TlsRecord specific to the Change Cipher Spec message. It includes a constructor from parameters that creates a standard message with a fixed byte sequence. The from_bytes method is unimplemented, indicating incomplete parsing functionality. No suspicious imports, no hardcoded credentials, no external network operations, or other malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition related to TLS protocol handling. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The incomplete from_bytes method suggests it is a partial implementation or a stub, not malicious code.",
