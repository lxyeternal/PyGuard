{
  "purpose": "Defines a specific TLS Change Cipher Spec record class with methods for creation and byte parsing.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'tls_version' in 'from_parameters' method.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'tls_version' flows into the creation of 'TlsRecordHeader' to generate a record object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for a TLS Change Cipher Spec record, including factory methods. It uses well-known class structures and constants, with no user input handling beyond parameter passing. The 'from_bytes' method is unimplemented, which is common for deserialization placeholders. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard, non-malicious class definition for TLS record handling with no apparent security issues or malware. It is likely part of a larger TLS parser library, with no suspicious intent.",
