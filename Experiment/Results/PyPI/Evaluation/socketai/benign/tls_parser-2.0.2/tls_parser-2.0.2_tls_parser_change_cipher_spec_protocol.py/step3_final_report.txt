{
  "purpose": "Defines a TLS Change Cipher Spec record class with methods to instantiate from parameters or bytes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'tls_version' in from_parameters; no external data sources; no dynamic input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "from_parameters creates a record with fixed content; from_bytes is unimplemented, so no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Unimplemented 'from_bytes' method; no suspicious imports, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard class for TLS record handling, with a method to create a record from parameters and a stub for parsing from bytes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The unimplemented method indicates incomplete parsing logic, typical in protocol libraries, not malicious intent. No external network activity, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard partial implementation of a TLS record class, with no signs of malicious or security-compromising behavior. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
