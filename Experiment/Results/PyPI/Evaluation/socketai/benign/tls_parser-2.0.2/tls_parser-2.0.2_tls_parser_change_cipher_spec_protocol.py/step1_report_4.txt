  "purpose": "Define a class for handling TLS Change Cipher Spec records, including creation from parameters and bytes.",
  "sources": "Input bytes in from_bytes method (not implemented), class instantiation parameters (tls_version).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or output explicitly.",
  "flows": "Input tls_version -> create message and header -> instantiate record; raw_byte input would flow into from_bytes (if implemented).",
  "anomalies": "from_bytes method is unimplemented, which may indicate incomplete code but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from TlsRecord to represent a Change Cipher Spec record in TLS protocol. It provides class methods to create instances either from parameters (tls_version) or raw bytes (not implemented). The from_parameters method constructs a message with a fixed byte (0x01) and a header with specified TLS version. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be part of a TLS parsing library and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class definition for TLS record handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unimplemented from_bytes method suggests incomplete code, but nothing malicious is evident.",
