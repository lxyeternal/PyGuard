  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for various TLS versions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple enum definition.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines an Enum class listing TLS version constants. It involves standard Python syntax with no input handling, no external data processing, and no side effects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. This appears to be a straightforward, benign code snippet intended for clarity or configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple enumeration for TLS versions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign and standard code pattern.",
