  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward enumeration class defining TLS version constants. There are no signs of input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic behavior. The code is static and simple.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. This assessment is accurate given the code snippet. There are no logical flaws or reasoning errors; the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - *Obfuscated:* All reports assign 0, which is reasonable.  \n   - *Malware:* All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n   - *Security risk:* All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any security concern that warrants a risk score above 0.5. The code is purely defining constants with no side effects, no data handling, and no malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a simple enum definition.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple, static enumeration defining TLS versions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews.",
