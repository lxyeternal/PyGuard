  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for TLS version identifiers.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or external data manipulation present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static enum definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines an enumeration class 'TlsVersionEnum' with four members representing different TLS versions. It uses standard Python enum syntax without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code included.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign enumeration class with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
