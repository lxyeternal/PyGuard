  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple enumeration class defining TLS version constants.\n   - No external input, data processing, or output is involved.\n   - The code uses standard Python syntax for enum definitions.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior or Anomalies:**\n   - No report indicates any signs of malicious intent, such as backdoors, hidden code, or data leaks.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code appears to be a benign, static configuration or constant definition.\n\n3. **Scores Consistency:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the analysis that the code is benign.\n   - The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - The code is straightforward and does not pose any security risk.\n   - No evidence suggests that the enum could be exploited or used maliciously.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard enum definition for TLS versions.\n   - There are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n   - The risk scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward enumeration with no security concerns. The reports are consistent, and the scoring accurately reflects the benign nature of the code.",
