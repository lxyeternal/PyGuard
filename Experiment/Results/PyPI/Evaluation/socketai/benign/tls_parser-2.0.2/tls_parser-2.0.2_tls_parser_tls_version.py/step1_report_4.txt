  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for TLS version constants.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard enum definition without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines an Enum class with four TLS version constants. There are no input/output operations, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. The use of Enum for constants is standard practice. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign enum definition with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
