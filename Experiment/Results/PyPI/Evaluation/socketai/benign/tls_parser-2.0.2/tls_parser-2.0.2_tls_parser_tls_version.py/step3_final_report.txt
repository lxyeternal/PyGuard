{
  "purpose": "Defines TLS version constants as an enumeration for use in TLS-related configurations or logic.",
  "sources": "Static code; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "None; static enum definition with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static enumeration class defining TLS version constants. It contains no input/output operations, no dynamic behavior, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores (1), and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions mean there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors present. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enum definition with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent; the malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should remain at 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
