  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various TLS protocol versions.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading in the provided code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward enum definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple enumeration class for TLS versions using Python's Enum. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. It appears to be a benign, static configuration or constant definition without external data handling or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign enumeration class defining TLS versions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
