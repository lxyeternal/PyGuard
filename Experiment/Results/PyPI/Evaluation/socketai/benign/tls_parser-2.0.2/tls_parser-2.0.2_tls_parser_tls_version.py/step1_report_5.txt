{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various TLS versions",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flows present; only a simple enum definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class for TLS versions with four members. It is straightforward and uses standard Python enum syntax. There are no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a simple, self-contained enumeration definition, likely used for version selection or validation in TLS-related modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign enumeration for TLS versions with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It serves as a data structure and does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.",
