{
  "purpose": "The code implements parsing and construction of TLS handshake messages, including RSA encryption of the pre-master secret, following standard TLS protocol procedures.",
  "sources": "Reads input bytes for message parsing, cryptographic parameters for RSA encryption, and constructs message bytes for transmission.",
  "sinks": "Constructed TLS messages stored in memory; no external data leaks or network transmission within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Source bytes are parsed into message objects; RSA encryption uses provided parameters; messages are assembled into byte sequences for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Cryptographic operations are standard and correctly implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard TLS handshake message parsing and construction, including RSA encryption of the pre-master secret. It uses typical Python cryptographic operations and data handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The cryptographic parameters are externally supplied, which could be manipulated if inputs are malicious, but this is typical in protocol implementations. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and align with TLS specifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard TLS handshake implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security risk score reflects potential issues if external inputs are malicious, but within this code snippet, no vulnerabilities or malware are evident.",
