{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse TLS record bytes into appropriate record objects based on the record type.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'raw_bytes' parameter, which is the raw TLS record bytes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that process untrusted data beyond parsing; it raises exceptions on unknown types.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'raw_bytes' to 'TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes', then based on the record type, to specific parsing methods like 'TlsHandshakeRecord.from_bytes' or 'TlsAlertRecord.from_bytes'.",
  "anomalies": "The code raises an exception ('UnknownTypeByte') for unrecognized record types, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. The import statements are for TLS parsing libraries, which are common in network analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward TLS record parser, routing input bytes to specific record handlers based on the record type. It handles known types (handshake, alert) explicitly, defaults to a generic parse for other types, and raises an exception for unknown types. No malicious or suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling mechanisms are evident. It does not perform any network communication or data exfiltration. The code appears to be part of a TLS analysis or inspection tool, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard TLS record parsing snippet with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It functions as a safe parser, routing data to appropriate handlers based on record type, and appropriately handles unknown types with an exception.",
