  "purpose": "Parse TLS record bytes into specific record objects based on record type.",
  "sources": "raw_bytes input parameter; TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes() method.",
  "sinks": "Potentially None; the code does not appear to output or store sensitive data, but relies on other modules.",
  "flows": "raw_bytes -> TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes() -> conditional parsing to different record types based on header.type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward for a TLS parser.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple TLS record parser that interprets raw byte data into structured record objects based on record type. It calls external methods for parsing header and record payloads. No data is leaked or sent over the network. The structure and control flow are typical for such parsers. No obfuscation, malicious, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code assumes that external modules handle security-sensitive processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard TLS record parser with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a TLS parsing library, and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
