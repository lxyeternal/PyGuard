  "purpose": "Parse TLS record bytes into specific record objects based on record type",
  "sources": "raw_bytes input parameter, TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes method",
  "sinks": "return statements, Tls*Record.from_bytes methods",
  "flows": "raw_bytes -> TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes -> conditional logic -> TlsRecord* from_bytes methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward data parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static method to parse raw TLS record bytes, first extracting the record header, then depending on the record type, delegating parsing to specific classes. The flow is simple and based on record type. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. It relies on external libraries for parsing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious control flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard parser for TLS records with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply delegates parsing tasks based on record types and handles unknown types with an exception. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
