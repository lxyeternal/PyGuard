  "purpose": "Parse TLS record bytes into specific record objects based on the record type",
  "sources": "raw_bytes input parameter in parse_bytes method",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data output or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "raw_bytes -> TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes -> type check -> specific record class from_bytes or fallback to TlsRecord",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected; code appears straightforward and standard for TLS parsing",
  "analysis": "The code reads raw TLS record bytes, extracts the header to determine the record type, and then delegates parsing to the appropriate class based on the type. It handles known types HANDSHAKE and ALERT explicitly and falls back to a generic TlsRecord for other valid types. It raises an exception if the type is unknown. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code uses standard parsing logic without obfuscation or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of TLS record parsing with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It correctly handles known and unknown record types and does not exhibit any malicious patterns.",
