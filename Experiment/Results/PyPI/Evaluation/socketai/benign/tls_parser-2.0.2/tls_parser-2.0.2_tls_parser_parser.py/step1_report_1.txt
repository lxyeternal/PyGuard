  "purpose": "Parse TLS record bytes into appropriate record objects based on record type.",
  "sources": "raw_bytes input parameter, which is the raw data to be parsed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources are present; function returns parsed objects.",
  "flows": "raw_bytes -> TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes -> type check -> corresponding record from_bytes method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The function parses raw TLS record bytes, determining record type from header, and delegates parsing to specific record classes. It raises an exception if the type is unknown. The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious intent. Usage of external classes is standard for TLS parsing libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard TLS record parser that correctly dispatches record parsing based on the header type. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
