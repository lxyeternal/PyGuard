  "purpose": "Parse TLS record bytes, identify record type, and delegate to appropriate record class for further parsing.",
  "sources": "raw_bytes input, TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes method, record_header.type attribute",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data beyond parsing, nor does it transmit data or execute code",
  "flows": "raw_bytes -> TlsRecordHeader.from_bytes -> record_header.type -> conditional branch -> specific record class parsing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard parsing logic, exception raised only on unknown record type, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward TLS record parser that reads raw bytes, extracts the header, and dispatches parsing based on the record type. It handles known types (handshake, alert) explicitly and defaults to a generic record class, raising an exception for unknown types. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. External modules are used for parsing, but based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious intent. The exception handling is standard, and the control flow is clear. The code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign TLS record parser with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
