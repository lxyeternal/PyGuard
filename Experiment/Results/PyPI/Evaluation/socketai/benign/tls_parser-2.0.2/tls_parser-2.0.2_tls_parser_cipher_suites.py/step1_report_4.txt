{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for various TLS cipher suite identifiers used in network security protocols.",
  "sources": "The code itself is a static definition; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output is observed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external inputs or outputs; it's purely a static enumeration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is a straightforward enumeration of known TLS cipher suite constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class-based enumeration listing many TLS cipher suite codes with their corresponding hexadecimal values. It uses the Enum class appropriately without dynamic execution or obfuscation. No external data reading, data leaks, or malicious operations are present. The enumeration includes a comprehensive set of TLS cipher suites, some of which are considered outdated or less secure, but their presence alone is not suspicious. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage. The structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static enumeration of TLS cipher suite constants. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to serve as a reference or configuration within a larger TLS/SSL context. No security concerns are identified based on this code fragment.",
