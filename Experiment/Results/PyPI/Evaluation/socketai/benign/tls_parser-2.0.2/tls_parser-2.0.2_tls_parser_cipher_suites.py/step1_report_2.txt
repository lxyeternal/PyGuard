  "purpose": "Definition of an enumeration for various TLS cipher suites with associated hexadecimal codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class declaration and the enumeration members, which are constants representing cipher suite identifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or output, as the code only defines static constants.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or input-output data paths are present; the code solely defines static enum members.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are observed. The code is a straightforward enumeration of cipher suite constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a class 'CipherSuites' with multiple constant members mapped to hexadecimal values. These represent various TLS cipher suite identifiers, ranging from legacy and insecure options (e.g., NULL, MD5, RC4) to modern secure options (e.g., AES GCM, ChaCha20). There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. Usage of Enum for such definitions is standard practice. The code appears to serve as a static reference or configuration, with no indication of malicious intent or covert behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration of TLS cipher suite constants without any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign static definition used for referencing cipher suites. No security risks or malware are identified.",
