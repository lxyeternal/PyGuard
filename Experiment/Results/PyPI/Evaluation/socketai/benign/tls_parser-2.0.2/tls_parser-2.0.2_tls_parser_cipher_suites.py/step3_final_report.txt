  "purpose": "A static enumeration listing TLS cipher suite identifiers with their hexadecimal codes, serving as a reference list for TLS configurations.",
  "sources": "The enum class defines constants for cipher suite names mapped to their respective hex codes.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data inputs; the code is purely a static list.",
  "flows": "No data flows or dynamic data processing; the code only provides constant mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static enumeration of TLS cipher suite constants with no dynamic behavior, data flow, or external inputs. It includes both legacy and modern cipher suites, but all are simply constant definitions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The inclusion of older cipher suites does not imply malicious activity but could be a configuration concern; however, it does not affect the security assessment of the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static list of TLS cipher suite constants with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a risk score of 0, are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
