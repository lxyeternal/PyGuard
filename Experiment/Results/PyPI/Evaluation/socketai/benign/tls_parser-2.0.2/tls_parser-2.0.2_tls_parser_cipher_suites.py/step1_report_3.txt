{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for various TLS cipher suite identifiers",
  "sources": "Importing Enum class from the enum module; class definition listing cipher suite constants",
  "sinks": "None; the code only declares constants and does not handle external input or output",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow between sources and sinks as there are only static definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward enumeration of cipher suite constants without any suspicious or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a class CipherSuites as an enumeration containing numerous TLS cipher suite constants mapped to their respective hexadecimal identifiers. The structure is standard and includes a comprehensive list of cipher suites, including legacy and modern algorithms, without any dynamic or runtime behavior. There are no indications of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code's purpose appears solely to standardize cipher suite identifiers for use elsewhere in a secure context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration of TLS cipher suite identifiers with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a static reference list and does not include any executable or data handling logic that could be malicious.",
