{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for various TLS cipher suite identifiers.",
  "sources": "Static enum class with constant values assigned to cipher suite names.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output operations or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a static enum definition without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. The code solely defines constants for TLS cipher suites.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a class 'CipherSuites' that enumerates numerous TLS cipher suite identifiers using hexadecimal values. There are no functions, external data inputs, or dynamic behaviors. The enumeration appears comprehensive for TLS configurations, including modern and deprecated suites, but no malicious or suspicious patterns are present. No obfuscated code, secret data, or malicious instructions are evident. The code appears to serve as a static reference mapping for cipher suite IDs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign enumeration of TLS cipher suite constants with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a static data structure for referencing TLS cipher suite identifiers.",
