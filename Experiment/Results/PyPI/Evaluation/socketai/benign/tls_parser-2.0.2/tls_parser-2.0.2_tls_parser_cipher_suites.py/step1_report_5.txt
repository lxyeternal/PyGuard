{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration of various TLS cipher suite identifiers using hexadecimal values.",
  "sources": "Static definitions within the Enum class; no runtime input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling; purely static enumeration definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The content is a comprehensive list of TLS cipher suite codes, with no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code simply creates an enumeration class with mappings from descriptive names to hexadecimal cipher suite codes. No functions, external calls, or dynamic behavior are present. The list covers standard and advanced cipher suite identifiers, including those for newer protocols (e.g., AES-GCM, CHACHA20). There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as a reference or configuration mapping for TLS security protocols.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static enumeration of TLS cipher suite identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code's purpose appears purely informational or for use as constants within a larger security-related application.",
