  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and evaluate their findings critically.\n\n1. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code imports `__version__`, `__author__`, and `__email__` from the `tls_parser` package and uses them in `setup()`.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No report mentions any anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n   - Given the simplicity of the script, these assessments seem accurate.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable based on the code provided.\n   - The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely a package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The security risk is also correctly scored as 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic or insecure operations.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence at hand.",
