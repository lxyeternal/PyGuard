  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a typical `setup.py` script for a Python package.\n   - It imports `__version__`, `__author__`, and `__email__` from the `tls_parser` module.\n   - These variables are used in the `setup()` function to define package metadata.\n   - There are no dynamic data inputs, no external or untrusted data sources, no code execution, or network calls.\n   - The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Issue Presence:**\n   - The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security flaws.\n   - All reported issues are consistent with a standard setup script.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is a benign, standard setup script.\n   - They correctly identify that no untrusted data handling, external effects, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, aligning with the absence of malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - The `malware` scores are correctly assigned as 0.\n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also correctly 0, reflecting no apparent vulnerabilities.\n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - The overall risk assessments are appropriate.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only minor point is that importing version and author info from within the package is common, but if these variables are dynamically generated or manipulated, it could pose a risk. However, based on the reports, there's no indication of that.\n   - Since the reports are consistent and thorough, no further suspicion arises.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No changes are necessary; the analysis aligns with the evidence.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.",
