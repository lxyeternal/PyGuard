  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling. The code only imports version, author, and email from within the package and uses setuptools to define package metadata.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Logic:**  \n   The code's purpose is straightforward: configuring package metadata for distribution. The logic is simple, with no data flows from untrusted sources, no external input, and no suspicious behaviors.\n\n3. **Potential Flaws or Anomalies:**  \n   No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code adheres to common Python packaging practices.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, non-obfuscated code.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Score Justification:**  \n   Since there's no evidence of malicious intent, dynamic code execution, or external data handling, scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n6. **Assumptions and Claims:**  \n   All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script without making unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate for scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that. No further action or concern is necessary.",
