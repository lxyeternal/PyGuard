  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and compare them with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools.\n- It imports version, author, and email info from the tls_parser package itself.\n- It does not process any untrusted input, perform dynamic code execution, or handle sensitive data.\n- The code appears straightforward and typical for packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script.\n- They note the absence of suspicious patterns, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior.\n- The sources are just imports of package metadata variables.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- All assign a confidence of 1, malware score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the imported variables (`__version__`, `__author__`, `__email__`) safe?**  \n  Yes, these are just metadata variables, typically strings, imported from the package's own module.\n\n- **Is there any indication of malicious behavior?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or code execution.\n\n- **Could importing these variables pose a security risk?**  \n  Not in this context. They are expected to be simple strings defined within the package.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned appropriate?**  \n  All reports assign malware and securityRisk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Any anomalies or overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**. The code is clear and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0**. No security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate. The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
