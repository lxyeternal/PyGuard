{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'tls_parser' Python library, importing metadata variables from within the package and configuring package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports of __version__, __author__, and __email__ from the tls_parser module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only reads package metadata and calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports package metadata variables and uses setuptools to define package configuration. It does not handle external input, perform dynamic code execution, network operations, or any other potentially malicious activity. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
