  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the 'tls_parser' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'setuptools' and 'tls_parser' module (__version__, __author__, __email__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink points or potentially dangerous data flows detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Code only performs standard package setup operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary components for package setup, retrieves metadata from the 'tls_parser' module, and invokes 'setup' with this data. No user input handling, network operations, or execution of dynamic code present. The code appears to be a standard, straightforward setup script for publishing a Python package. No malicious behaviors or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
