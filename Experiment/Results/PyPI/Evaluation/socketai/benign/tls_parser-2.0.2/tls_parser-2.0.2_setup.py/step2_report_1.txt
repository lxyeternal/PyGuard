  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and verify their assessments.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward setup script that imports version, author, and email from the package itself and uses setuptools to configure the package. There are no indications of untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. All reports agree that the code is standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the script is a typical setup configuration with no suspicious elements. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:  \n   Since all reports conclude no malicious activity or security risks, the malware score of 0 is justified. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious, such as executing untrusted code, network calls, or handling untrusted input.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard setup script.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is standard and safe. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis confirms that the package setup code is secure and poses no security risks.",
