{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the tls_parser Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and tls_parser module (__version__, __author__, __email__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on input",
  "flows": "Imports provide package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected; straightforward setup script",
  "analysis": "The script imports metadata variables from tls_parser and uses setuptools to define package details. No dynamic code execution, no reading of user input, no network calls, and no suspicious behavior present. All variables are imported from the package's own module, likely defined within, and the setup configuration appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply configures the package metadata and dependencies.",
