  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for TLS parsing errors, with type hints and conditional import for type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statement for type hints from tls_parser.record_protocol, used only during static type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input, or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'super' in UnknownTlsVersionByte constructor appears incorrect; it calls super with ValueError instead of the current class. No other unusual behavior or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up custom exceptions for TLS parsing, with conditional import for type hints. The constructor of UnknownTlsVersionByte improperly calls super(ValueError, self).__init__(message), which might be a bug but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. Overall, a straightforward class definition with a minor bug.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, intended for error handling in TLS parsing. The only notable issue is an incorrect call to super(), which does not introduce malicious behavior but may cause runtime errors. There is no malware or security risk detected.",
