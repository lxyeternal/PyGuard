  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for TLS parsing errors, including context-specific error information.",
  "sources": "None (no input or external data reading).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for conditional import, which is standard for type hints; no suspicious or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from ValueError. The 'UnknownTlsVersionByte' class includes an additional attribute to store record type info. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for optional type import suggests standard type hinting practices. There are no code injection points, data leaks, or malicious behaviors evident. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for error handling related to TLS parsing, with no suspicious constructs or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard Python practices for custom exceptions and conditional type annotations.",
