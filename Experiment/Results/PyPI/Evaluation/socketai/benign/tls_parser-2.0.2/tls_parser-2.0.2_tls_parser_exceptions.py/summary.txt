  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for TLS error handling. The only flaw is a minor bug in the constructor's super() call, which does not pose security risks. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, and the risk score is low. Fixing the super() call will improve code correctness but is not critical for security."
