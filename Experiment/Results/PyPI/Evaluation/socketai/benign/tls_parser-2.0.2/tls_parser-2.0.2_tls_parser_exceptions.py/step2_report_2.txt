  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code defines three custom exception classes for TLS parsing errors. Notes the use of `TYPE_CHECKING` for conditional import, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious features are detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for error handling. No issues with the logic or security.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** The malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature. The risk score is 0, consistent with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, but highlights a potential bug in the constructor of `UnknownTlsVersionByte` where `super(ValueError, self).__init__(message)` is used instead of `super().__init__(message)`. This is noted as a bug but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the minor bug. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Malware remains at 0. The security risk is noted as 0.1, which might be slightly high for a bug but acceptable since it’s not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Repeats the previous points, emphasizing the incorrect use of `super()` and calling it with `ValueError`. It considers this a minor bug and notes no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The bug is acknowledged but does not pose security issues.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Malware remains at 0. The security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with the same incorrect `super()` call. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, with a minor bug.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Malware remains 0; security risk is 0.1, consistent with previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again notes the incorrect `super()` call but confirms no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is straightforward, with a minor bug.\n\n- **Score adjustments:** Malware remains at 0; security risk at 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; the malware score should be **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated; the obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk score:** The main concern is the incorrect use of `super()` in the constructors, which is a bug but not malicious. Given that, a risk score of **0.1** is appropriate across reports.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The bug in the constructor (`super()` call) should be corrected for proper behavior, but it does not introduce security risks.\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**             | **0.1**    |\n\nThis reflects that the code is benign, with a minor bug that should be fixed but does not pose security concerns.",
