  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code defines three custom exception classes for TLS parsing errors.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` for conditional import is standard.\n- The only technical issue noted is the incorrect use of `super()` in the constructor of `UnknownTlsVersionByte`, which appears to be a bug, not malicious.\n- No data processing, input/output handling, or untrusted data handling occurs in this code.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0, aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the `super()` bug but states it's not malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, risk 0.1 due to the bug (not malicious).\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is reasonable; it's a bug but not a security risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, notes the bug, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, risk 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- **Risk score:** Acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, minor bug, no malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Risk score:** Appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; minor bug, no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0, risk 0.0 or 0.1 (as per report). The report states 0, which is acceptable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions for TLS parsing.\n- The only technical flaw is the incorrect use of `super()` in the constructor, which is a bug but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the bug is minor and not security-related, a risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, but 0 is also acceptable if emphasizing no security risk.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with a minor bug that should be fixed but does not introduce security risks.\n- The malware score should stay at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The risk score can be kept at 0 or slightly increased to 0.1 for the bug, but 0 is fine.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering the bug as a minor issue)\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis that there is no malicious intent or security concern in this code snippet.",
