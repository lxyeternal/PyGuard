  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to TLS parsing.",
  "sources": "Import statement for type checking of TlsRecordTypeByte; usage of class inheritance and exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data output or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; no data processing or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in ValueError. It uses conditional import for type checking purposes, which is standard practice to avoid runtime dependencies. The custom exception 'UnknownTlsVersionByte' attempts to initialize the base ValueError with a message but incorrectly calls super(ValueError, self).__init__(message) instead of super().__init__(message), which is a common mistake. This suggests a potential bug but not malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, intended for error handling in TLS parsing logic, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a simple, standard implementation of custom exceptions with a minor bug in the superclass constructor call. No security concerns are evident.",
