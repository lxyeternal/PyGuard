  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- Defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `ValueError`.\n- Uses `TYPE_CHECKING` for conditional import of `TlsRecordTypeByte`.\n- The class `UnknownTlsVersionByte` includes an attribute for record type info.\n- There are multiple instances where `super()` is used incorrectly in the constructors, specifically `super(ValueError, self).__init__(message)` instead of `super().__init__(message)`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code itself is straightforward and benign.\n   - The main technical flaw is the incorrect use of `super()` in the constructors of `UnknownTlsVersionByte`. This is a bug, not malicious.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n   - No actual data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling occurs here.\n\n2. **Malware, Obfuscation, and Security Risks:**\n   - All reports assign malware score `0`. This aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is `0`, indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk is minimal; the only potential concern is the incorrect `super()` call, which is a bug but not a security vulnerability.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The malware score should remain `0` — no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should stay `0`.\n   - The risk score could be slightly increased if the bug could cause runtime errors, but since it’s a simple mistake, it doesn't elevate the risk to a significant level. The reports have assigned `0.1` in some cases, which seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is for error handling in TLS parsing.\n   - The assumption that the code might be malicious is unfounded; there's no evidence supporting that.\n   - The reports correctly note the incorrect use of `super()`, which is a bug, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The bug in `super()` usage should be corrected to prevent potential runtime errors.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes needed for malware or obfuscation scores.\n- The security risk score could be marginally increased if desired, but `0.1` is acceptable given the minor bug.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor bug, unlikely to cause security issues)\n- **Super() bug:** Should be fixed for correctness, but does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign utility module for TLS error handling with a minor bug in constructor super() calls. It poses no security threat or malware risk. The scores are appropriate, and no further escalation is necessary.",
