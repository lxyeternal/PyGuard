  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for TLS parsing errors, with optional type hinting for TLS record types.",
  "sources": "Import statement for TYPE_CHECKING, which is used to conditionally import type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and an import condition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior detected. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hinting without runtime impact.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes for specific TLS parsing errors, with one class utilizing type hints for a TLS record type. The import statement for 'TlsRecordTypeByte' is guarded by 'TYPE_CHECKING' to avoid runtime import issues. The __init__ method in 'UnknownTlsVersionByte' incorrectly calls 'super(ValueError, self).__init__(message)', which is unusual since it should call 'super().__init__(message)'. However, this does not introduce malicious behavior; it is a potential bug or stylistic issue.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, minimal setup for custom error handling related to TLS parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be a safe, non-malicious definition of custom exception classes for TLS parsing errors. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and uses standard Python patterns. Minor bug in 'super()' usage does not impact security but should be corrected.",
