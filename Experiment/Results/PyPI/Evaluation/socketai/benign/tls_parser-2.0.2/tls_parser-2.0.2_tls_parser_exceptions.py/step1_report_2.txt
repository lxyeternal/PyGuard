  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling TLS parsing errors, with conditional import for type hinting.",
  "sources": "The import statement for TlsRecordTypeByte under TYPE_CHECKING, and the constructor of UnknownTlsVersionByte that uses the imported type.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only defines classes and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; no runtime data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of super() with ValueError in UnknownTlsVersionByte constructor appears incorrect; potentially a bug but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions for TLS parsing errors, which is typical in network protocol implementations. The conditional import avoids import errors during type checking. The only notable issue is the incorrect use of super() in the constructor, which seems to be a bug rather than malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious or obfuscated parts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious set of class definitions for error handling in TLS parsing, with a minor bug in the use of super(). There are no security threats or malicious behaviors detected.",
