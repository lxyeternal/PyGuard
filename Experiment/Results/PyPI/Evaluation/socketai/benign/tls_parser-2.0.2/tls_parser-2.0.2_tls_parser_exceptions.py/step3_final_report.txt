{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for TLS record parsing errors, including handling unknown types and versions.",
  "sources": "Conditional import of TlsRecordTypeByte during type checking; no runtime data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only establishes exception class structures.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect use of super() in UnknownTlsVersionByte constructor: super(ValueError, self).__init__(message) instead of super().__init__(message). This is a bug, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exceptions for TLS parsing errors, with standard structure. The main issue is the incorrect super() call in UnknownTlsVersionByte, which could cause runtime errors but does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The malware score remains 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score remains 0, indicating clear code. The security risk score is low (around 0.1), reflecting the minor bug that should be fixed for correctness but does not threaten security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for TLS error handling. The only flaw is a minor bug in the constructor's super() call, which does not pose security risks. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, and the risk score is low. Fixing the super() call will improve code correctness but is not critical for security.",
