  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign visualization utility for molecular structures in IPython notebooks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk stems mainly from external script loading, which is standard in open-source visualization tools. Scores are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk (~0.1-0.2)."
