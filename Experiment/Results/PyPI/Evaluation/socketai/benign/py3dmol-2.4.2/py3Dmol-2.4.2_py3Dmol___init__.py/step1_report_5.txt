{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python interface for creating and displaying 3D molecular visualizations in IPython notebooks using the 3Dmol.js library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, json, re, time, importlib.metadata, and conditional imports of IPython.display; reads no external input apart from function arguments and module metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses IPython.display.publish_display_data to output HTML and JavaScript code, which can include dynamic JavaScript commands that may execute in the browser environment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the Python code into HTML/JavaScript via string interpolation and JSON serialization, which is then rendered in the notebook for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. The code dynamically loads an external script (3Dmol.js) and constructs complex HTML/JavaScript for visualization, which is standard for such tools.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs HTML and JavaScript to embed a 3Dmol.js viewer in IPython notebooks, dynamically loading scripts and generating visualization commands. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. It relies on external libraries (IPython, json, re, time) and standard JavaScript execution in the browser environment. No hardcoded secrets or access credentials are present. The code does generate and execute JavaScript in the browser context, but this is expected behavior for visualization tools and does not appear malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility for molecular data in IPython notebooks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply constructs and renders HTML/JavaScript for visualization purposes without any evidence of sabotage or harmful intent.",
