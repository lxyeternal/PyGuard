{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python class for creating, updating, and exporting 3D molecular visualizations using 3Dmol.js within IPython notebooks. It dynamically generates HTML and JavaScript code to embed viewers, load external scripts asynchronously, and manipulate molecular models.",
  "sources": "Reads environment info, package metadata, user inputs for molecular data, styles, options, and parameters for visualization and layout.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML and JavaScript snippets embedded via IPython's display functions, which manipulate the DOM to render molecular viewers and export images.",
  "flows": "Python inputs → string-based JavaScript commands and HTML → embedded in notebook for rendering and interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden code. Uses predictable IDs via timestamp. External scripts loaded from CDN, which could be a supply chain concern but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs static HTML/JS for molecular visualization, loading external libraries asynchronously, and provides methods for display, update, and export. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Dynamic code generation is controlled and limited to visualization commands. External CDN dependency is a potential attack vector but common in such tools. The use of json.dumps() ensures safe data embedding. Overall, the code is a benign, well-structured visualization utility with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign visualization utility for molecular structures in IPython notebooks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk stems mainly from external script loading, which is standard in open-source visualization tools. Scores are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk (~0.1-0.2).",
