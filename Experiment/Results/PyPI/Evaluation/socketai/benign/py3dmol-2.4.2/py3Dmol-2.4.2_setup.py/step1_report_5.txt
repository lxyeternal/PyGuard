  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution via setuptools, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; static string data for package metadata; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; purely static configuration code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code adheres to common setup.py conventions and contains no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a typical package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only performs static setup tasks without external or untrusted data flows.",
