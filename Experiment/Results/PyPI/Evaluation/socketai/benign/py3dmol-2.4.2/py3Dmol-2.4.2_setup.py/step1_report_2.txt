{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static assignment of package metadata (name, version, author, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs",
  "flows": "Static data assignments flow directly into setup() without user input or external influence",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated segments",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and reads a static README file to include as long_description. All package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers are hardcoded. No user input, environment variables, or network communications are involved. The code adheres to standard practices for Python package setup. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. It appears to be a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It safely defines package metadata and dependencies without any signs of malware or security risks.",
