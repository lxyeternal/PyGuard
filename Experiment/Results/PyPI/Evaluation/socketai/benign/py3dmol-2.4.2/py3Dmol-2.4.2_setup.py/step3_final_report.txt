  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from file read to variable assignment, then to setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard packaging script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a trusted README file and calls setup() with static metadata. No external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation are present. All signals indicate benign, well-formed code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score should be 0 across all reports.",
