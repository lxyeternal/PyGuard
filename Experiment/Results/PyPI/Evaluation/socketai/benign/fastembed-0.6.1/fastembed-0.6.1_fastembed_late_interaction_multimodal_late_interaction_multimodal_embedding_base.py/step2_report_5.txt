  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of abstract base classes defining method signatures for embedding text and images.\n- All methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are meant to be overridden.\n- There are no data processing, network calls, or external interactions in this snippet.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign framework setup for model management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports correctly identify the code as an abstract class with no malicious or security-related concerns.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Logical flaws:** None detected. All reports consistently describe the code as an abstract, non-malicious class.\n- **Misleading claims:** No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are made, which is accurate.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly reflecting that the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to 0, consistent with the absence of security issues.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a high risk score; all are at 0 or near 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n\n- The reports correctly note that the code does not perform any data processing or external communication.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made, and none are justified based on the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard abstract class with no malicious or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. They correctly identify that the code is a benign, structural framework component, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided analysis and the code's characteristics.",
