{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for multimodal embedding models with methods for embedding text and images, intended for extension and implementation.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data directly but defines method signatures for future data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or external data outputs present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs in this code as it is a class definition with abstract methods; no actual data processing or transmission is implemented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for embedding models, with method signatures that specify embedding text and images. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions; the methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are meant to be overridden. The class setup appears typical for a model management framework. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious abstract class definition for multimodal embeddings. It does not contain any malware or security risks, nor does it perform any data transmission or other suspicious activities. The code appears safe and intended for legitimate extension.",
