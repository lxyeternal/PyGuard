{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for multimodal embedding models, providing method signatures for text and image embedding without implementation details.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data directly but defines methods meant to be overridden.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow occurs in this abstract class; it only defines method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Contains no suspicious code, hidden behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; only abstract method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract base class with method signatures for embedding text and images. It imports standard modules and types, and no data processing or external interactions are performed here. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The design is typical for a model management framework, focusing on structure rather than implementation. No anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign abstract base class intended for defining interfaces in a larger framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to be subclassed with specific implementations, and it does not handle untrusted data directly.",
