{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for multimodal embedding models, providing method signatures for text and image embedding functionalities.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted input read; all data inputs are method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data handling present; methods are abstract and do not execute code that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No executable data flow; method signatures do not include code that processes data, only interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code appears standard for defining a class interface.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and defines an abstract base class with methods meant to be overridden. There are no data processing or external communication operations. All methods raise NotImplementedError, indicating they are meant to be implemented elsewhere. The class manages model configuration and provides interfaces for embedding text and images but contains no executable logic or potential malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class for multimodal embedding models with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely defines interfaces without executing any logic that could compromise security.",
