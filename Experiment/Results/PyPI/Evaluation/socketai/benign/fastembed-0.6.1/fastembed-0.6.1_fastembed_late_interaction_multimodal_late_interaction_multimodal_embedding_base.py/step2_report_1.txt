  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The provided code defines an abstract base class (`LateInteractionMultimodalEmbeddingBase`) with methods for embedding text and images.\n   - All methods raise `NotImplementedError`, indicating they are meant to be overridden in subclasses.\n   - The class manages model configuration parameters but contains no actual data processing, external calls, or logic.\n   - The code imports standard modules and types, with no suspicious or obfuscated constructs.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - **Malware:** No evidence of malicious code, such as backdoors, code injection, or suspicious behaviors. The code is purely structural.\n   - **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code patterns or hidden behaviors.\n   - **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Since the code is abstract and does not handle data directly, there are no apparent vulnerabilities related to data leaks, injection, or insecure handling.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a benign, standard abstract class definition.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and the malware scores are zero across all reports.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Consistently 0; justified given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0; no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Risk Score:** Very low (0 or close to 0); appropriate because the code is purely structural and abstract.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code is abstract, actual security risks would depend on the implementations in subclasses.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here; the code itself appears safe.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores seem reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to account for potential risks if subclasses mishandle data, but the base code itself is safe)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, non-malicious abstract class definition with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
