  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the security concerns are justified, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines an abstract base class with no data processing, no external interactions, and no malicious code. The methods raise `NotImplementedError`, indicating they are meant to be overridden.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no apparent risks.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a benign, standard abstract class with no security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the class is an abstract base with no actual data handling, no external calls, and no suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a straightforward abstract class with no data processing, external interactions, or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign; no security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the class is an interface with no executable logic, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the class is an abstract interface with no data processing, network calls, or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no risks.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is purely abstract and contains no malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, matching the code's straightforward, readable structure.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are 0, as the code does not perform any operations, data handling, or external communication that could pose security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- The code snippet is a standard, non-malicious abstract class definition intended for extension.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign, structural component of a larger framework, with no security concerns.",
