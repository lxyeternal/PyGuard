{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for multimodal embedding models, providing method signatures for embedding text and images without implementation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'documents' and 'images' which accept input data; class attributes for model configuration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow occurs as methods are unimplemented; intended to be overridden in subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code detected; straightforward abstract class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structural, abstract class with no data processing, external calls, or malicious code. It contains only method signatures meant for extension. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with its purpose as a framework component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious abstract class with no security risks or malware. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
