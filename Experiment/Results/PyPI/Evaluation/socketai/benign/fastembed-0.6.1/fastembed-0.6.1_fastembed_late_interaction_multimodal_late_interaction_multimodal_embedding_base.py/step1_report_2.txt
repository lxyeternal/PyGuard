{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for multimodal embedding models handling text and image inputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class methods: documents, images, kwargs; class attributes model_name, cache_dir, threads, _local_files_only.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted inputs are mishandled, but methods are not implemented; no direct sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters (documents, images) through method calls to embedding functions, which are not implemented; no actual data processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. Methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError; no malicious code is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with methods intended for embedding text and images. It relies on external implementations for functionality, with no actual data processing, network calls, or insecure handling shown. No anomalies or malicious logic are present. The code structure is typical for an abstract class, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, non-malicious abstract class for multimodal embeddings. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The methods are not implemented, limiting the risk analysis, but nothing in the provided code indicates malicious intent.",
