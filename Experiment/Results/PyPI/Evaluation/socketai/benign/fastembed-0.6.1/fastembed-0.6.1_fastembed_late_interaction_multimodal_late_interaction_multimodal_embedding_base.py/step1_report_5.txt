  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for multimodal embedding models, including methods for embedding text and images.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to embed_text (documents, batch_size, parallel, **kwargs), input parameters to embed_image (images, batch_size, parallel, **kwargs).",
  "sinks": "None directly present; the code raises NotImplementedError, indicating that actual embedding logic is expected to be implemented in subclasses.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are received and stored or passed to subclasses; no data flows to external systems or insecure sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The class is a straightforward abstract base for embeddings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structure for embedding text and images, with methods designed to be overridden in subclasses. It includes parameters that could control batch processing and parallelism but does not implement any logic itself. There are no external network connections, file manipulations, or data leak points. The code does not handle untrusted input directly, nor does it execute dynamic code or contain suspicious code patterns. The presence of NotImplementedError indicates that actual functionality is delegated elsewhere, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a structural, abstract base class for embedding models. It contains no executable logic, no network or file operations, and no signs of malicious intent. It appears safe and intended for use in larger, controlled systems.",
