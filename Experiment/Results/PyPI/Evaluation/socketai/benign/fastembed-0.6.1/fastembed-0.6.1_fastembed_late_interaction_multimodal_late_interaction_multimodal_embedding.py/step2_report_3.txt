  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the code and the findings.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines a class for managing multimodal embeddings, supporting text and image encoding.\n- It uses a registry pattern for supported models, validates models during initialization, and provides methods for embedding.\n- The code relies on external libraries (`fastembed`) for core functionality.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or network activity is observed.\n- The logic appears standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual code issues or vulnerabilities.\n- **Code correctness:** The code logic for model registration, selection, and embedding functions appears correct and straightforward.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain threats.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws, errors, or mistakes are identified across reports.\n- The code structure and flow are typical for such a model management class.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above 0 (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in model management code, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The **risk scores** seem reasonable; the code does not perform any network calls, file modifications, or secret handling.\n- The **malware scores** are correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are 0, aligning with the clarity of the code.\n- The **security risk scores** are low but non-zero, which is acceptable given the code's role in model management and potential exposure if external models are malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **No issues are present in the code.**\n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.**\n- **No adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal inherent risk, typical for model management code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free from supply chain threats or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and accurate.",
