{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for multimodal embeddings, supporting text and image encoding using various models registered in the system.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include 'documents' (text) and 'images' (image paths or data), passed into embed_text and embed_image methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks in this code that could leak data; the only possible data leaks depend on the embedded data being sensitive and externally accessible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs ('documents' and 'images') through the model's embed_text and embed_image methods, ultimately returning embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms observed. The code relies on external models and does not perform any network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a modular approach to handling multiple embedding models, supports dynamic model registration, and provides methods for encoding text and images. It uses standard Python practices and external library calls for model management. No indications of obfuscated code or malicious logic are present. It solely manages data input and output for embedding tasks. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation for handling multimodal embeddings. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious operations detected. It functions solely as an interface to supported models for embedding text and images.",
