{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for multimodal embedding, supporting text and image encoding using various models, with dynamic model loading and list capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as model_name, documents, images, and optional configurations. Internal calls to model methods.",
  "sinks": "Yielding of embeddings, which are numerical arrays, and raising of ValueError for unsupported models.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> model initialization -> embed_text/embed_image calls -> yield embeddings or raise errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code mostly handles model management and data encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model selection, input handling, and data encoding tasks. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious data handling is present. It relies on external models and standard libraries, with no evident malicious activity. No network calls, file modifications, or secret management detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a multimodal embedding class, primarily for managing models and encoding data. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated components are present. It appears safe and free from supply chain threats.",
