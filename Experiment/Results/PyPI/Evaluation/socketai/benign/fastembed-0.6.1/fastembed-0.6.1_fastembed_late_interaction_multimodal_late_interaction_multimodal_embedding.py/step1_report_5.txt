{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for multimodal embedding that supports multiple models and provides methods for embedding text and images.",
  "sources": "Class initialization (__init__), list_supported_models, embed_text, embed_image methods, and model support list methods.",
  "sinks": "Data flows primarily within class methods; no evident sinks that transmit untrusted data externally such as network, file system, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input data (documents, images) flow through embed_text and embed_image methods to the model's embedding functions; model name validation occurs during initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of standard library features and clear method definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured class for managing multiple multimodal embedding models, supporting model listing, validation, and embedding functions. It employs standard Python practices with no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The model selection mechanism relies on model name validation, and embedding functions yield results from the underlying model. All inputs and outputs appear to be handled normally within the class design. No external insecure operations or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a multimodal embedding manager with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as expected for its purpose without introducing security threats.",
