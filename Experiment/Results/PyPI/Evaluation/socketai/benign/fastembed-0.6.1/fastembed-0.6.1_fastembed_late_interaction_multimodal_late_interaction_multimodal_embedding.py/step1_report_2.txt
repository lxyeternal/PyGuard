{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class for multimodal embedding models, supporting text and image embedding functionalities within a larger framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard Python modules (typing, dataclasses), and from 'fastembed' package components.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct output to network, file, or external system from this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code mainly sets up model management and embedding methods, without untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code features present. Methods are standard, and code structure appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing and invoking multimodal embedding models, supporting text and image embedding via provided methods. It uses a registry pattern for supported models, performs model validation during initialization, and exposes embedding functions. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The code relies on external packages for core functionality, which are not part of this review, but usage appears standard and safe. There are no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a model wrapper and management class, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It maintains good coding practices and relies on external, presumably trusted, libraries. Overall, the code is safe and standard in its structure.",
