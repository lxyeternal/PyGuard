  "purpose": "This code defines a class for managing multimodal embeddings, supporting model listing, dynamic model validation, and embedding functions for text and images. It facilitates loading supported models and providing embedding outputs.",
  "sources": "Model name input during initialization, external model registry, and data inputs for embedding functions (documents and images).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Model name validation from supported models during init; embedding functions pass data to underlying model methods, yielding embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing and utilizing multimodal embedding models. It performs model registration, validation, and data encoding with straightforward logic. No external network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The model selection is based on string matching, which is safe here. Embedding functions use generators to yield results, a common pattern. Overall, the code is well-structured, transparent, and free from malicious or malicious-like behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk in model management code.",
