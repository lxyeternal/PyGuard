{
  "purpose": "Define an ONNX-based multimodal embedding model supporting text and image processing, with parallelization capabilities and tokenization.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, loads models, tokenizes text, processes images, and reads environment info (e.g., CPU count, start methods).",
  "sinks": "Runs models (`self.model.run`), performs tokenization, loads images, and possibly calls external processes via environment info; no explicit untrusted sink identified.",
  "flows": "Input data (text/image) flows through tokenization and preprocessing, then into ONNX model inference; output flows from model to post-processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of standard libraries and patterns consistent with legitimate ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured pipeline for loading and running ONNX models for multimodal embeddings, with support for parallel processing. It loads tokenizers and preprocessors, and handles input data carefully, converting images and text into model inputs. Environment info is used for multiprocessing setup, which is typical for high-performance ML tasks. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no secret hardcoding or backdoors. All operations rely on standard ML and data processing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, implementing standard practices for model inference and data handling. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage detected. The structure is clear, and the usage of dependencies is appropriate for a secure ML pipeline.",
