  "purpose": "Evaluate the security posture of the provided Python code for potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on supply chain threats and malicious code indicators.",
  "sources": "Model loading functions, tokenization, preprocessing, inference calls, multiprocessing setup, image processing, and data flow paths from input to model output.",
  "sinks": "Model inference outputs, data returned from functions, and potential external data handling points (though none are evident).",
  "flows": "Input data (text/images) -> preprocessing (tokenization, image encoding) -> model inference -> output processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard multimodal ONNX inference pipeline with parallel processing support. It loads models, tokenizers, and preprocessors securely, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The data flow is typical for ML inference, and no external network calls or secret data are present. The multiprocessing setup uses common start methods, and the code relies on well-known libraries. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security posture is sound. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects standard ML deployment considerations without security concerns.",
