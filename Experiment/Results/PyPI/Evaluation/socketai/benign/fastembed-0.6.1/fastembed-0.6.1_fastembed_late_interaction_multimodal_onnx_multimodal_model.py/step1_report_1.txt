  "purpose": "Define a multimodal ONNX-based embedding model for text and images with methods for preprocessing, tokenization, and parallel processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments (text, images), environment variables for process start methods, and external model files for ONNX models.",
  "sinks": "Outputs embeddings, calls external ONNX models, and loads tokenizers and preprocessors.",
  "flows": "Input data (text/images) flows into tokenization/preprocessing functions, then into ONNX models for embedding, with outputs processed and yielded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious domain calls, or unusual code behavior; parallel processing setup appears standard. The code structure is typical for ML pipelines.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a multimodal embedding pipeline with support for text and image inputs, including tokenization, preprocessing, batching, and parallelization. It loads models and tokenizers dynamically, uses standard library features, and has no indications of hidden or malicious code. The use of multiprocessing start methods, model loading, and image processing appear standard for ML inference. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code's overall structure and operations are consistent with legitimate ML serving components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a multimodal embedding system using ONNX models, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected operations for ML inference pipelines without hidden or suspicious activities.",
