  "purpose": "Defines alias and subclass for text embedding models, with deprecation warning for older classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements, logger warning, class __init__ method for JinaEmbedding.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Deprecation warning suggests potential for outdated or replaced code; no malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines deprecated aliases for TextEmbedding. It issues a warning about deprecated classes and defines a subclass JinaEmbedding, which initializes a text embedding model with given parameters. The code does not include any data input, external communication, or execution of untrusted code. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and serves as an interface for embedding models with deprecation warnings. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident.",
