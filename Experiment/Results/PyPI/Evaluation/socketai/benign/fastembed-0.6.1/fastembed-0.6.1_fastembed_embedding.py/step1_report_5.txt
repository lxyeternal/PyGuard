{
  "purpose": "The code defines aliases for TextEmbedding and a subclass JinaEmbedding for initializing text embedding models, with a warning about deprecated classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, loguru, fastembed; usage of logger.warning; class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, no external data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets up class inheritance and logs a warning.",
  "anomalies": "The code issues a warning about deprecation but does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines class aliases, with a subclass JinaEmbedding that inherits from TextEmbedding. It logs a deprecation warning for other embedding classes and sets default parameters for the JinaEmbedding constructor. No input/output handling, network activity, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard setup code with no malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as a wrapper or alias for text embedding classes with a deprecation warning. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
