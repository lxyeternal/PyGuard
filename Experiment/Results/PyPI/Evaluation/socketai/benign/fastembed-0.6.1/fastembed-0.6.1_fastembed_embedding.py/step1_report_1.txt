{
  "purpose": "The code defines deprecated aliases for TextEmbedding and a subclass JinaEmbedding for creating text embedding models using the jina model.",
  "sources": "Import statements, logger.warning call, class constructor parameters",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external calls",
  "flows": "No significant data flows; mainly class definitions and a warning message",
  "anomalies": "Usage of deprecated aliases, no apparent malicious code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, issues a deprecation warning for certain classes, and defines a subclass JinaEmbedding that extends TextEmbedding with customizable parameters. No untrusted data inputs, network calls, or potentially malicious logic are present. The warning indicates deprecation but not malicious intent. The code appears straightforward and focused on class definition and user notification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module primarily for defining class aliases and a subclass, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or hardcoded secrets. Overall, it appears safe.",
