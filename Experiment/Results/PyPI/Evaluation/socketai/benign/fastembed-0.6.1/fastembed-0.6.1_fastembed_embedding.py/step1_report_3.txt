  "purpose": "Define deprecated aliases for TextEmbedding and create a subclass JinaEmbedding that initializes with specific default parameters.",
  "sources": "import statements, class constructor parameters, logger warning message",
  "sinks": "None; code does not handle untrusted input or output data",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings, but no suspicious or malicious code detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and logs a deprecation warning for certain classes. It then creates aliases for TextEmbedding and defines a subclass JinaEmbedding that initializes the parent class with specific default parameters. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or data leaks. The code appears to be a straightforward extension of a library without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper and aliasing of existing library classes with a deprecation warning. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It mainly serves as an interface or compatibility layer.",
