{
  "purpose": "Define deprecated aliases for TextEmbedding and extend TextEmbedding with a subclass JinaEmbedding for model initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements, logger.warning call, class definitions, __init__ method with parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network calls, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Logger warning executed at module load; class instantiation may initialize models but no external data flow or network activity observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, issues a deprecation warning via logger.warning, defines alias variables for TextEmbedding, and a subclass JinaEmbedding that initializes with default parameters. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. The deprecation warning is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The class structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or security flaws. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended for backward compatibility and ease of use. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.",
