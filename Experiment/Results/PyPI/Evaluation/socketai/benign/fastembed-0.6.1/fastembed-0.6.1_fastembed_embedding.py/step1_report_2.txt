{
  "purpose": "The code defines aliases for TextEmbedding and a subclass JinaEmbedding for embedding models, mainly for deprecated warnings and class inheritance.",
  "sources": "Logging warning message; importing modules; class constructor parameters",
  "sinks": "Logger warning outputs; potential use of model_name and cache_dir parameters in parent class",
  "flows": "Logging message flows to console; constructor parameters passed to parent class",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warning; no unusual code patterns or suspicious dynamic execution; no hardcoded credentials or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and embedding classes, issues a warning about deprecation, and defines a subclass JinaEmbedding that inherits from TextEmbedding. It uses standard class inheritance and does not execute any untrusted code or data. The warning indicates an upcoming deprecation but does not affect current functionality. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; no data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for managing embeddings with deprecated class aliases and a subclass. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The warning message is standard practice for deprecations. Overall, it is safe.",
