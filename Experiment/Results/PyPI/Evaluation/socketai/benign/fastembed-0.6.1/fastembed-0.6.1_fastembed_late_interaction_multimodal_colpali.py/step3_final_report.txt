{
  "purpose": "The code implements a multimodal embedding system wrapper, managing model loading, tokenization, preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing for text and image data using ONNX models.",
  "sources": "Model files, environment variables (for cache path), input data (text and images), and static placeholder arrays within the code.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or network activity; data flows from input (text/images) through tokenization/preprocessing to model inference and output.",
  "flows": "Input data (texts/images) are tokenized or preprocessed, then fed into the ONNX model, with static placeholders used for missing data, and outputs are post-processed into embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "Large static numpy arrays used as placeholders (e.g., EMPTY_TEXT_PLACEHOLDER, EVEN_ATTENTION_MASK) are benign; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing and running a multimodal embedding model, with proper handling of model files, tokenization, and inference. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage are present. The static placeholders are typical in such models. No network activity or secrets are evident. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation for a multimodal embedding system. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The static numpy arrays are benign placeholders. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score is zero, and the risk score is appropriately low (~0.1).",
