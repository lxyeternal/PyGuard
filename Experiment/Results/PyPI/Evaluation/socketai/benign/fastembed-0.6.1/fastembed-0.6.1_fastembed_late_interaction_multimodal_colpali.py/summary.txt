  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation for a multimodal embedding system. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The static numpy arrays are benign placeholders. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score is zero, and the risk score is appropriately low (~0.1)."
