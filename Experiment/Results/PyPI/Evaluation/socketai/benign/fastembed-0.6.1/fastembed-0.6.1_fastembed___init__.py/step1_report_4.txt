{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific modules and classes from the 'fastembed' package and determines the package version, exposing certain components for external use.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() retrieves the package version; no other external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; version info retrieval is a safe operation.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The version check attempts to retrieve the package version from either 'fastembed' or 'fastembed-gpu' and falls back accordingly, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing modules related to embedding models from the 'fastembed' package and handling version retrieval via importlib.metadata. The try-except block for package version is a common pattern to support different package variants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical module setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import and initialization script for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs safe version retrieval and exposes selected classes for use.",
