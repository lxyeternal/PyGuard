{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and classes from the 'fastembed' package, setting version information and exposing certain classes for external use.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('fastembed') or 'fastembed-gpu' to determine package version",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems",
  "flows": "Retrieval of package version from metadata, then assigning module-level variables and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. The try-except for version detection is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the package version by querying metadata, falling back from 'fastembed' to 'fastembed-gpu' if necessary. It then sets the __version__ variable and defines the public API via __all__. All operations involve standard library functions and module imports without any dynamic code execution or external network access. No suspicious behavior, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that manages imports and version info. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
