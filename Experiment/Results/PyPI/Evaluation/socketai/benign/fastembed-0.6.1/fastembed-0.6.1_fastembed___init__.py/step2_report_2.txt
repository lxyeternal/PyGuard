  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python package initialization script.\n- The code performs safe imports, retrieves package version info via `importlib.metadata`, and handles fallback to an alternative package name.\n- No external data flows, network interactions, or untrusted data handling are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The logic is straightforward, with typical patterns used in Python package setup files.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n- The code is clean, well-structured, and uses standard practices.\n- The version retrieval includes a fallback, which is common.\n- There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no code injection, and no external network calls.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clean, straightforward code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no evident vulnerability or attack vector.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.\n\n**Final note:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. The scoring reflects this appropriately.",
