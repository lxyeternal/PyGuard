  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard package initialization script, importing modules and retrieving version info.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, justified given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly notes the safe import patterns and version retrieval logic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and standard practices.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0; security risk at 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the straightforward import and version detection logic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0; security risk at 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Accurately describes the code as a typical module setup with safe practices.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0; security risk at 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**  \n- The code is a standard Python package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.  \n- The scores assigned across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's logic and behavior.  \n- There are no suspicious data flows, external network interactions, or malicious patterns detected.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
