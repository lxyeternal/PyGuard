  "purpose": "Initialize the fastembed package by importing submodules, retrieving version info, and defining public API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for submodules and importlib.metadata.version() call for version retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network interactions or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() call; Sink: setting __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version retrieval logic; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization: importing specific classes, retrieving package version with a fallback, and defining __all__ for exports. It uses safe, static import statements and handles missing package info gracefully. No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and follows common Python practices. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The version retrieval pattern is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
