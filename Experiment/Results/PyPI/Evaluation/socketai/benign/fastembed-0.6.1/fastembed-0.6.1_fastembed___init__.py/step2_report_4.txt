  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a typical `__init__.py` for a Python package, performing standard imports, version detection, and defining exports.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, safe, and uses standard practices.\n- No untrusted data handling, external network interactions, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The version detection via `importlib.metadata` with a fallback is a common pattern.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The logic is clear and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n   No logical errors or flaws are evident. The fallback to `'fastembed-gpu'` if `'fastembed'` is not found is a common pattern.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**  \n   All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is safe.\n\n5. **Malware score justification:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. No malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All claims are supported by the code analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n**My own evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. The version detection is safe, and there are no external data flows or attack vectors.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Category | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0              |\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is safe and free from malicious or suspicious behavior.",
