{
  "purpose": "The code imports various components from the 'fastembed' library and attempts to determine its version, likely for module setup or initialization.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() calls for retrieving package version, and static imports from 'fastembed' submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external data are present; the code only reads package metadata and imports modules.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading package version metadata and importing specific components, with no data flow from external inputs to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are observed. The version fallback logic is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves the version of the 'fastembed' package, with a fallback to 'fastembed-gpu' if the primary package is not found. It imports specific submodules and defines the module's exported interface. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python practices for package metadata access and module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup script with safe imports and version detection, exhibiting no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
