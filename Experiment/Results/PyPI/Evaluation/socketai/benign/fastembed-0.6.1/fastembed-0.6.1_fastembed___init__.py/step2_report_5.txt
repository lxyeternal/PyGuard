  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the scores and potential risks.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python package initialization script (`__init__.py`) that imports specific classes from submodules, retrieves the package version dynamically, and exposes a public API via `__all__`.\n- It uses `importlib.metadata.version()` to fetch version info, with a fallback to an alternative package name (`fastembed-gpu`) if the primary is not found.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any dynamic code execution.\n- The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical package setup patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; standard import and version retrieval.\n- **Sinks & flows:** No external data sinks or flows.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations; standard package init code.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion; straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with others; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify this as benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** All are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code only performs safe imports and version checks, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions; the analysis correctly interprets the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical, well-structured package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The consistent findings across all reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
