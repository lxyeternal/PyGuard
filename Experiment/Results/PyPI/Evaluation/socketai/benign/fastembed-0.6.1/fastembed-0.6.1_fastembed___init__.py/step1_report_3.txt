  "purpose": "Import and expose components of the fastembed package, and determine its version.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() to read package version; import statements for various fastembed modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used or exposed; version info is retrieved but not transmitted externally",
  "flows": "Retrieving package version and exporting module components; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The version retrieval includes a fallback to a different package name, which is normal for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from the 'fastembed' package and attempts to retrieve its version. It handles the case where the package might be named 'fastembed-gpu'. It then defines __version__ and __all__ for exporting. There are no signs of code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior. The logic is straightforward and typical for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages package versioning and exports selected components.",
