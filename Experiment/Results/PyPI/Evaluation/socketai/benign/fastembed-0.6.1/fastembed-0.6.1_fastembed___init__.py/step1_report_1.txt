{
  "purpose": "Import modules and set up package versioning and exports for the fastembed package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata for version retrieval, import statements for specific classes from fastembed submodules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions. No untrusted data handling or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The version retrieval is straightforward and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is clean and standard for a Python package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific classes from the fastembed package and attempts to determine the package version dynamically. It handles exceptions if the package is not found, switching to an alternative package name. All actions are standard for a Python package's initialization script, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks detected. It simply manages imports and versioning, with no external data flows or potential attack vectors.",
