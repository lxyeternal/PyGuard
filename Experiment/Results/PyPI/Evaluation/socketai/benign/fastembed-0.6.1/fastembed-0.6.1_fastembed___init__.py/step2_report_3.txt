  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard package initialization script that imports specific modules, retrieves version info, and sets up exports.\n- No suspicious behaviors, external data leaks, or malicious code are indicated.\n- The code is straightforward, using standard Python practices.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: it imports classes from submodules, retrieves the package version with a try-except fallback, and defines `__all__`.\n- No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- No external network activity or data flows from untrusted sources are involved.\n\n**Errors or Flaws:**\n- The reports are consistent; no errors or logical flaws are evident.\n- The fallback to 'fastembed-gpu' in case 'fastembed' is not found is standard and safe.\n- The import statements are static and do not involve dynamic code execution.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that version retrieval and static imports are safe, which is reasonable.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent or malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical `__init__.py` for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The logic and reasoning in the reports are sound and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The version retrieval and import statements are safe and common practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are justified. No changes are necessary.",
