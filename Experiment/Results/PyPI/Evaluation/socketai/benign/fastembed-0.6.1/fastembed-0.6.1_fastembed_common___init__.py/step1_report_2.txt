  "purpose": "This code defines the public API of a module by importing specific types from another module and explicitly listing them in __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing types from 'fastembed.common.types'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations; no handling of untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "Importing types from a local module; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of an import statement and setting the __all__ variable to specify exported symbols. There are no input/output, network operations, or data handling that could be exploited or used maliciously. The imported components are from a local module and are likely type annotations or simple classes. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply manages module exports.",
