  "purpose": "To re-export specific types from 'fastembed.common.types' as the public API of this module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'fastembed.common.types'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Static import of types leading to their inclusion in '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three classes/types and defines '__all__' for module exports. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, standard module pattern. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module export pattern with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
