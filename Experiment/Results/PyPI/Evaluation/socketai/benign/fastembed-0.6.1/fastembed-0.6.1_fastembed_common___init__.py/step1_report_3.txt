  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface of a module by importing specific types from a package and setting __all__ for exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'fastembed.common.types' that loads three specific classes/types.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the import statement (source) to the module's namespace; no further data flow or processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and only involves imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three types from a package and defines __all__ for module exports. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious constructs. It appears to be a typical module setup for type annotations or interface exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up exports for other modules.",
