  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module re-export pattern, importing specific classes/types from 'fastembed.common.types' and setting `__all__`.\n- No reports mention dynamic code execution, network activity, handling of untrusted data, or any suspicious patterns.\n- The code is minimal, static, and typical for Python modules that define an API surface.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n- The original code matches all reports: it only imports three classes/types and defines `__all__`.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data flow from untrusted sources.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Scores assigned:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only performs static imports and exports, with no data handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code, the risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly challenge any assumptions of vulnerabilities—none are present.\n- No claims of malicious intent are justified based on the code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n- The scores align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard module export pattern, common in Python projects.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
