{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific types from a module within the fastembed package and defines the public API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'fastembed.common.types'. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code only sets __all__ for module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling; the code solely involves static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three specific types from a relative module, indicating reliance on existing package structures. It then declares the __all__ list to control what symbols are exported when the module is imported elsewhere. There are no input, output, or data manipulation operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard module export setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions purely as an interface declaration for specific imported types.",
