  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes from a module within the package for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes from 'fastembed.common.types'",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import and export",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from a module and defines the public API via __all__. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no credential handling. The code appears to be standard Python module export code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module re-export with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
