  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom fastembed.common.types import ImageInput, OnnxProvider, PathInput\n\n__all__ = [\"OnnxProvider\", \"ImageInput\", \"PathInput\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code is a straightforward import and export declaration.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \nAll describe the code as a simple module re-export, with consistent reasoning. They correctly identify that this code only imports specific classes/types and declares them in `__all__`.  \n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- `malware`: 0 (correct, no malware detected)  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 (correct, code is straightforward)  \n- `securityRisk`: 0 (correct, no risks identified)\n\n**Assessment of scores:**  \nAll reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The `obfuscated` score is also 0, as the code is clear and standard. The `securityRisk` is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis:\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent?**  \n  No. The code only performs static imports and sets the module's public API. No dynamic code, no secrets, no network activity.\n\n- **Are any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. The scores are consistent with the code and reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the code, the consistent reports, and the lack of any suspicious activity, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect that the code is benign and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard module re-export with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The reports are accurate and align with the code's nature.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current assessment with all scores at 0, confirming the benign nature of this code snippet.",
