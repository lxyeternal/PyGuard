{
  "purpose": "Import and export specific types from a module, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing types from 'fastembed.common.types'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks of untrusted data or actions; this is a simple import and export statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, importing and exporting symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three specific classes or types from a package 'fastembed.common.types' and defines an export list. There are no dynamic code execution, data handling, or any suspicious operations. The imported modules are likely part of a library or package for handling images and model providers, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is minimal and appears to be an innocuous part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import/export statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to serve as an interface for other modules to access these types.",
