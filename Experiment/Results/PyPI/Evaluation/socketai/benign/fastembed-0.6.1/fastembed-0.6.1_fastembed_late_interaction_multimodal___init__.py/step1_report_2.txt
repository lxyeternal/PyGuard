  "purpose": "Export the LateInteractionMultimodalEmbedding class for external use from the fastembed library module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a specific internal module within the package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output; the code only defines an export list",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; purely an import and export declaration",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a single import and an export list; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an internal module within the package and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It does not process input, handle untrusted data, or contain any logic that could be exploited. There are no obfuscation signs, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply facilitates proper module interface definition.",
