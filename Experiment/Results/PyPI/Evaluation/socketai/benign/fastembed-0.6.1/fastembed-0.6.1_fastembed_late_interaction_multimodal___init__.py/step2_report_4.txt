  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import and export statement, with no data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is minimal, standard Python module export pattern.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are detected in any report.\n- The confidence scores are all 1.0, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign description.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code snippets in the reports match the original code exactly.\n- No discrepancies between the reports' descriptions and the original code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues are identified; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and justified.\n\n**Risk and malware scores:**\n- Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious activity, the risk score should remain low (around 0.0).\n- Malware score is correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity described.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is benign, serving as a module interface.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or conclusions.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the descriptions provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe module export statement with no security issues or malicious behavior detected.",
