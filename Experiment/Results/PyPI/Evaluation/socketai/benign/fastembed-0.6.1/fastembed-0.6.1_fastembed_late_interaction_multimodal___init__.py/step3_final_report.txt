  "purpose": "Import a class from a nested module within the 'fastembed' package and expose it via __all__ for module export.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'fastembed.late_interaction_multimodal.late_interaction_multimodal_embedding'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only performs import and export declaration.",
  "flows": "Import from the nested module to the module's namespace, exposing the class via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement and an __all__ declaration, typical for defining module exports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this pattern, assigning a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscation score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0). There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code's simplicity and standard structure justify the scores. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
