{
  "purpose": "This code exports a class 'LateInteractionMultimodalEmbedding' from a specific module within the 'fastembed' package, likely for use in a larger machine learning or embedding framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'fastembed.late_interaction_multimodal.late_interaction_multimodal_embedding', which reads the module's code and metadata during import.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data outputs, network connections, or external data writes are shown.",
  "flows": "Import process reads the module; class is made available via __all__, with no data flow or execution beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and an __all__ declaration, which are standard Python practices for module exports. It imports a class from a nested module within the 'fastembed' package and exposes it publicly. No functions, data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be part of a package's interface definition without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export statement with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It serves as an interface for other modules to use the imported class, with no signs of malware or suspicious activity.",
