  "purpose": "Export the LateInteractionMultimodalEmbedding class from the fastembed.late_interaction_multimodal.late_interaction_multimodal_embedding module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a class from a module within a package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard import/export statements. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a module within the fastembed package and exposes it via __all__, indicating intended public API. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no sinks involved. The code is minimal, clean, and conventional. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export statement with no malicious or security-related concerns. It appears benign and serves to expose a class for use in other parts of the project.",
