  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is just an import and an `__all__` declaration; no malicious activity or security issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Obfuscated is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Justification:** The score of 0 for malware and risk is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; purely an import/export pattern.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are suggested.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, just an import and export.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, matching the benign analysis.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same straightforward import/export.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No problems.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk are 0, justified.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, fitting the description.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports describe a simple import/export pattern with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent and reasonable.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the current scores.**",
