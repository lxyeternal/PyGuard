{
  "purpose": "The code implements a multiprocessing framework for parallel data processing using worker classes, queues, and process management. It aims to distribute tasks across multiple workers, collect results, and manage process lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Input data stream provided to semi_ordered_map; input_queue.read() when putting items; environment variables indirectly via os.getpid() for process identification.",
  "sinks": "output_queue.put() for processed items; queues used for inter-process communication; logging.info() for process and worker status.",
  "flows": "Stream data is fed into input_queue; worker processes consume from input_queue; processed data is put into output_queue; main process retrieves from output_queue and yields results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code. Usage of multiprocessing with shared memory is standard, but the code does not verify the safety of data or include obvious malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no hidden network communication, or suspicious file access observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a multiprocessing pool setup with worker classes processing data in parallel. It manages queues and processes carefully, with clean shutdown procedures and error handling. No suspicious data leaks, network communication, or credential handling present. The use of logging is benign. The code appears to be a standard parallel processing utility with no signs of malicious activity. All data flows seem intentional and contained within the process boundaries. The code does not contain any obfuscated elements or suspicious data handling beyond normal multiprocessing operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard multiprocessing framework intended for parallel data processing. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It appears to be legitimate utility code for distributing tasks across processes. No security risks are evident from the code structure, data flow, or behavior.",
