  "purpose": "This code implements a multiprocessing worker pool for processing data streams in parallel, with functions for starting worker processes, managing queues, and ensuring orderly data processing.",
  "sources": "Input data stream provided to semi_ordered_map, which enqueues items onto input_queue; environment variables potentially accessed indirectly via os.getpid() (though not sensitive).",
  "sinks": "Output queue where processed data items are placed; error signals (QueueSignals.error) are sent to indicate worker failure.",
  "flows": "Items from input stream are enqueued into input_queue, processed by worker instances, and results are retrieved from output_queue. Error signals propagate from workers back to main flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of broad exception handling that captures all exceptions could mask underlying issues but is not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected. The code is well-structured with standard multiprocessing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a multiprocessing worker pool pattern, with clear separation between worker process code (_worker), worker management (ParallelWorkerPool), and control flow. The worker processes invoke a class method start() and process() without any dynamic code execution or obfuscation. Error handling involves logging and signaling through a dedicated error signal. No signs of data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The only notable aspect is the broad exception handler in _worker, which could obscure underlying errors but does not indicate malicious intent. Queue management and process cleanup follow best practices, reducing risk of resource leaks or deadlocks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a parallel processing framework with standard multiprocessing techniques. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior, hardcoded secrets, or privacy violations. The overall security risk is very low, with no malicious intent evident.",
