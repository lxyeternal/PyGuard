  "purpose": "A multiprocessing framework managing worker processes, queues, and error handling for data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input queue (input_queue.get()), data streams (stream enumeration), external process signals (QueueSignals.stop/error).",
  "sinks": "Output queue (output_queue.put()), error signaling via QueueSignals.error, process termination signals.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input_queue, processed by worker.process(), results placed on output_queue, with control signals (stop/error) managing flow termination.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling in _worker; no external network activity; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard multiprocessing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard multiprocessing setup with worker processes consuming and producing data via queues, with proper process lifecycle management and error handling. No suspicious external communications, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present. The broad exception handling is typical but could mask errors; however, it is not malicious. The shared counter for active workers is a common pattern. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate multiprocessing utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It employs standard patterns and practices, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero, consistent with the analysis.",
