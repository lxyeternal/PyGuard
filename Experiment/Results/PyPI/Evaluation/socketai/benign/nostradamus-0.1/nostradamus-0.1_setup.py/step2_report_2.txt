  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Review the provided code for issues**\n\nThe code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package named \"nostradamus\". It defines the package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. Based on the code:\n\n- No obvious malicious code or suspicious logic.\n- The `entry_points` specify a console script `weather-reporter` pointing to `weather_reporter.cli:main`. This indicates a command-line interface, but without seeing the actual `weather_reporter` package, we can't verify its contents.\n- The dependencies (`requests`) are common and benign.\n- The code reads the README.md file for the long description.\n\n**Step 2: Review the reports**\n\nAll reports are empty (\"Empty response\"), providing no details about potential issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 3: Logical assessment of the reports**\n\nSince reports contain no information, there's no evidence of malicious code, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n**Step 4: Scores and their justification**\n\n- **Malware score:** Since no evidence of malicious behavior exists, this should be low (close to 0).\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, no obfuscation present, so score should be near 0.\n- **Risk score:** Without any specific vulnerabilities or malicious indicators, the risk score should be minimal, likely below 0.1.\n\n**Step 5: Critical evaluation**\n\n- The only point of concern could be the `entry_points` referencing `weather_reporter.cli:main`. If this module or function contains malicious code, that would be a concern. But we cannot verify this from the provided code.\n- The package dependencies are standard; no red flags there.\n\n**Step 6: Final assessment**\n\nGiven the absence of detailed reports or suspicious code, the initial scores should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for potential issues in unseen parts)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code itself appears benign.\n- The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues.\n- The scores should reflect the lack of detected or suspected malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nBased on the provided information, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nIf more detailed reports or code snippets become available, reassessment would be necessary.",
