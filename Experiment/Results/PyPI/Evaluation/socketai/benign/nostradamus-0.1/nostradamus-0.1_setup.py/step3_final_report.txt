  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'nostradamus' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; package metadata; dependencies; entry points for CLI.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'weather_reporter.cli:main' when CLI is invoked.",
  "flows": "Setup script reads README -> installs dependencies -> registers CLI command 'weather-reporter' -> invokes 'weather_reporter.cli:main' upon CLI call.",
  "anomalies": "Entry point references 'weather_reporter.cli:main' while package only includes 'nostradamus', indicating potential misconfiguration or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only concern is the mismatch between the package name 'nostradamus' and the CLI entry point referencing 'weather_reporter', which may cause runtime errors if 'weather_reporter' module is absent. The provided reports are empty, offering no evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. Dependencies are standard, and code structure is straightforward. The potential misconfiguration does not imply security risk but should be corrected to prevent deployment issues.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main issue is a likely misconfiguration in the entry point module name, which could cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent. Given the lack of detailed reports, the overall security risk is minimal.",
