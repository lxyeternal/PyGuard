  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code snippets are extremely minimal, consisting only of a copyright notice, a version string, and an import statement for `nostradamus.forecaster.Nostradamus`.\n- There are no functions, data processing, network activity, file operations, or other typical indicators of malicious behavior.\n- The import of an external library does not, in itself, indicate malicious intent; it depends on the library's behavior, which is not visible here.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The reports uniformly conclude benign intent, which aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description—only an import, version string, and copyright.\n- **Malware presence:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Since there's no active code, data handling, or external communication, the risk score being near zero is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of the Reports:\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - **Score:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0  \n   - **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.  \n   - **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - **Score:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1  \n   - **Conclusion:** Slightly elevated security risk due to the import, but the code itself is benign.  \n   - **Assessment:** Slightly overstates the risk; importing a library alone doesn't pose a security risk. I suggest lowering the securityRisk to 0.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - **Score:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.  \n   - **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - **Score:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.  \n   - **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - **Score:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.  \n   - **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential for malicious behavior:** The code itself doesn't execute any logic, so the risk is minimal.  \n- **External library:** The only concern could be if the `nostradamus` library is malicious or compromised, but that cannot be determined from this snippet. Given the context, it's assumed to be a legitimate package.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0 for all reports; no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** For the minimal code, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate. Slightly elevated scores (like 0.1) are unjustified unless there is additional context.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments that these snippets are benign. The only minor adjustment is to set the security risk to zero across the board, given the absence of any suspicious activity.**",
