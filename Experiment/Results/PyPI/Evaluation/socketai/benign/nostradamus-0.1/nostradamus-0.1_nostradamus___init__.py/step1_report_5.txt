{
  "purpose": "The code imports a forecasting library, likely for predictive analytics or data analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'nostradamus.forecaster' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data outputs or external communication functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible; the code only contains an import statement and a version string.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments, an import, and a version declaration, with no executable or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, importing a module possibly used for forecasting tasks. There are no input sources, data handling, or external data transmissions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The comments are standard copyright notices. The code appears benign and typical for an open-source project initialization or module definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward import statement with a version identifier, indicating standard, benign project setup code.",
