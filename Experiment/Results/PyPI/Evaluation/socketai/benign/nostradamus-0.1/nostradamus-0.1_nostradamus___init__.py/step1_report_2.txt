{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal script that imports a class 'Nostradamus' from the 'nostradamus.forecaster' module and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from nostradamus.forecaster import Nostradamus', assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks; no network or file operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; code only imports a class and sets a version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, importing a module component and defining a version string. There are no indications of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. Since the imported module is external, its behavior cannot be assessed here, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a basic module import and version declaration.",
