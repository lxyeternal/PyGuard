{
  "purpose": "The code imports a forecasting class from the nostradamus library, likely for performing predictions or analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statement from nostradamus.forecaster, no other data input points.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways are present, as the code only contains an import and a version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure, no suspicious patterns or hidden code. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with a version identifier and a copyright notice. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be a minimal setup for a project that uses the nostradamus forecasting library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of only an import and a version declaration. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
