  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The code is a minimal setup: copyright, version, import.\n- No data flow, no suspicious activity.\n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar minimal code: import, version.\n- No data leaks or malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) is reasonable given the minimal code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly above zero) justified as minimal risk due to reliance on external code.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: import, version.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- High confidence (1) justified.\n- Scores: all zero for malware, obfuscated, risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar minimal code, benign description.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), justified.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same benign pattern.\n- Confidence 1, scores all zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- The external library `nostradamus.forecaster.Nostradamus` is imported but not used here; this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 or very close to it, reflecting no evident security threat.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and consistent. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident from this code snippet.",
