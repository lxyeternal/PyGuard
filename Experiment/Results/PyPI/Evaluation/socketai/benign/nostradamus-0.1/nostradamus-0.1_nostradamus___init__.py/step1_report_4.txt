{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata and import a forecasting library for potential analysis or forecasting purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports 'Nostradamus' from the 'nostradamus.forecaster' module, which may load external or third-party code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data output, network connections, or sensitive operations are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet; no source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, but the import of a forecasting library may be suspicious if used maliciously; however, no malicious behavior is evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a copyright notice and imports a specific class from a module. There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or other suspicious behavior. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent, especially in the context of a typical package setup or a module that might be used legitimately. The version string is standard. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activities, or obfuscated constructs. Overall, this appears to be a benign, minimal module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a simple module that imports a forecasting class and sets a version string, with no suspicious operations or data leaks.",
