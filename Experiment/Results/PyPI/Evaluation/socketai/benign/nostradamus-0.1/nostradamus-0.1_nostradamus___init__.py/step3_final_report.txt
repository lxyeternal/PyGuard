{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal module setup, primarily importing a forecasting library and defining a version, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from nostradamus.forecaster import Nostradamus' is the only source of external data or code execution.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of a copyright notice, a version string, and an import statement. It does not execute any logic, handle data, or perform network operations. The imported library is not used within this snippet, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign purpose, likely as part of a larger project setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the security risk score also at 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
