{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python module with a version identifier and imports a class from an external library, likely for forecasting or prediction purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'nostradamus.forecaster.Nostradamus', which indicates reading the external library's code during execution.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not perform any data output, network activity, or system modification.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink within this snippet; the code only imports a class without instantiating or calling methods.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice but no executable logic or data handling; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and consists solely of a copyright comment, a version string, and an import statement for an external package. There are no functions, data processing, or other logic that could be malicious. The import suggests reliance on an external forecasting library, but without any further code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or data leakage. The code is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation or unusual features.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a simple module setup with no suspicious activity.",
