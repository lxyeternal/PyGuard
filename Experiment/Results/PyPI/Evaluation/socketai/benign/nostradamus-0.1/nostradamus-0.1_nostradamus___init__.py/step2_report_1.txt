  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is minimal—just a copyright, version string, and an import.\n- **Malware:** Score 0. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** Score 0. Correct; code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0. Reasonable, as no suspicious activity is present.\n- **Confidence:** 1. Fully confident in the benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar minimal code—import and version string.\n- **Malware:** Score 0. Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0. Correct.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1. Slightly above zero, but given the code's simplicity, perhaps too high. No evidence of risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9. Slightly less, but still high.\n- **Verdict:** The security risk score should likely be 0, as there's no indication of any security concern. The minimal code does not justify a non-zero risk score.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—import and version.\n- **Scores:** All consistent with benign code.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same minimal pattern.\n- **Scores:** Consistent and appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same benign structure.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity.\n- The only point of contention is Report 2's securityRisk score, which is slightly above zero despite no suspicious activity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjust Report 2's securityRisk score from 0.1 to 0** to better reflect the benign nature of the code.\n- **Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0** across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code appears to be a simple, benign module setup with no security concerns.",
