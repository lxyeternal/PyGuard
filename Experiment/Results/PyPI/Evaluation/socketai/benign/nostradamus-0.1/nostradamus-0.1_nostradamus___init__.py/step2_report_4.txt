  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is minimal, only a copyright, version string, and an import statement. No executable logic, data flow, or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high (1). These seem appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal structure—import and version string, no data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No, reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. The security risk is slightly above zero but justified given the code's simplicity and reliance on external code.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable, given the minimal code and external dependency.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no executable code or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high (1), and the reasoning is sound.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal code, only import and version.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import and comments.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified by the minimal code and external dependency reliance.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code snippets.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, 0, and 0.1 respectively, reflecting the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to external dependency import, but no malicious activity)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the reports' assessments and supports their scoring.",
