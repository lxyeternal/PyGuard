{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class named 'Nostradamus' with an initializer that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "There are no external data sources or input reading operations in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or output functions that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present as the code only initializes a class and prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports numpy and pandas libraries but does not use them, which could be unusual or suspicious if unused imports are considered potentially obfuscating or hiding intent; however, this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing only import statements and a simple class with an __init__ method that prints a greeting. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code. The unused imports might suggest incomplete code or potential obfuscation, but in this fragment, they do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior detected. The presence of unused imports is noted but not suspicious on its own.",
