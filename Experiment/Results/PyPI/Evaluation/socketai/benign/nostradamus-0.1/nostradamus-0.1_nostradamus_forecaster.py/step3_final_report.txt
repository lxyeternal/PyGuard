{
  "purpose": "Minimal class definition with a print statement; no malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement during initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports numpy and pandas; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple class with an __init__ method that prints 'hello!'. Imports are unused, indicating possible incomplete code but not malicious intent. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The unused imports are not indicative of malicious intent but suggest incomplete code. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0.",
