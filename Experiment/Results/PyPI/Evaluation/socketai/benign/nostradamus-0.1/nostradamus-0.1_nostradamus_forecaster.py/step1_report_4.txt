{
  "purpose": "A simple class that prints a greeting message upon instantiation.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external sources or perform any potentially unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as no input/output or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of numpy and pandas imports without utilizing them; minimal code activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Nostradamus' with an initializer that prints 'hello!'. There are no data sources or sinks, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns. Imports of numpy and pandas are present but unused, which may indicate incomplete code or unnecessary dependencies, but do not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The unused imports are not suspicious per se but suggest incomplete implementation.",
