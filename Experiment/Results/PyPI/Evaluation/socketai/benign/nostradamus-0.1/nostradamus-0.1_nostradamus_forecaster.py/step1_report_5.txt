{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple class 'Nostradamus' that prints a greeting message upon initialization.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read; the code only prints a static message.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is straightforward and does not process external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. Imported libraries 'numpy' and 'pandas' are not used, which could be considered unnecessary but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two standard data manipulation libraries but does not utilize them. It defines a class with a constructor that prints a message. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears benign, with minimal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to be a simple, harmless class definition. There are no malicious behaviors or security issues detected.",
