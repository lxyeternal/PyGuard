{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple class with an initialization message, likely intended for some data processing or other application.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'numpy' and 'pandas' libraries, but does not use them within the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports libraries and defines a class with a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward. It imports two common data processing libraries but does not utilize them, which could suggest incomplete code or preparation for further development. The class 'Nostradamus' has an __init__ method that simply prints 'hello!', with no malicious behavior or hidden functionality. There are no security issues, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a minimal, likely incomplete snippet that does not perform any harmful actions.",
