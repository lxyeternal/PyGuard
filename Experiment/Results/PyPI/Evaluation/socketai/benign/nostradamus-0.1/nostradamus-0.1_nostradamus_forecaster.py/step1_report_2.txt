{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple Python class named Nostradamus with an initializer that prints a greeting message.",
  "sources": "None - the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None - no data outputs, network calls, or file writes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports numpy and pandas but does not use them, which could be a sign of unused dependencies or potential obfuscation. However, unused imports alone are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, defining a class with a constructor that prints a message. No suspicious or malicious operations are present. The imported libraries are unused, which could be benign or an indicator of incomplete code, but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unused imports may suggest incomplete or template code but do not indicate malicious intent.",
