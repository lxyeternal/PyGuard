  "purpose": "Initialize the Nostradamus forecasting tool after modifying sys.path to include a local directory.",
  "sources": "Reading sys.path modification, importing Nostradamus, and calling it.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "sys.path modification -> import Nostradamus -> call Nostradamus()",
  "anomalies": "Modification of sys.path to include a user-specific directory (/Users/naftali/), which could be exploited if the directory is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, appends a local directory to sys.path, and initializes a forecasting class. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident. The sys.path modification is typical in development but could be a vector for malicious modules if the directory is compromised. The call to Nostradamus() is opaque without internal details but shows no suspicious behavior. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero; risk is low (0.1-0.2), mainly due to environment modification. Confidence is high (0.7-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a setup for forecasting with no malicious intent. The low risk score reflects minor concerns over environment modification, but overall, it is safe.",
