{
  "purpose": "The code initializes the Nostradamus forecasting library after importing necessary modules.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard libraries (sys, numpy, pandas) and appends a local directory to sys.path for importing nostradamus.forecaster.Nostradamus.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Imports libraries, modifies sys.path, then calls the constructor of Nostradamus, with no further data flow or external output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.path to include a local directory could be suspicious if used maliciously, but in this context appears benign; no secrets or hardcoded credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common scientific libraries and appends a local directory to sys.path, which can be normal in development environments. The call to Nostradamus() appears to instantiate or initialize the library. No user input, external data, or suspicious behavior is evident. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, intended to set up a forecasting environment by importing libraries and initializing Nostradamus. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
