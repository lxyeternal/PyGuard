  "purpose": "Minimal module setup importing components and defining __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module (.module), references in __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ declaration; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'export' and 'serve' in __all__ without definitions or imports, indicating incomplete or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local module and declares __all__ including 'export' and 'serve' which are not defined or imported, suggesting incomplete or placeholder code. No data processing, input/output, or dynamic execution is present. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are evident. The missing references could cause runtime errors but do not imply security threats. The code is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py or similar setup. The scores from reports consistently indicate no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk due to incomplete references.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module initialization code with incomplete references that could lead to runtime errors but do not pose security risks. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0; the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to reflect minor incomplete references but no security concern.",
