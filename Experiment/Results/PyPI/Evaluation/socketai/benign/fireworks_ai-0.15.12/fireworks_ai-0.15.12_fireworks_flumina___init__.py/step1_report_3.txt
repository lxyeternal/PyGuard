{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for a Python package, specifically importing components from a local module and setting the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module .module to import FluminaModule and main.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import from local module, then define __all__ for exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns observed. The __all__ includes 'export' and 'serve', which are not defined or imported in this snippet, indicating potential issues or placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard in structure. It imports specific components from a local module and specifies the public API with __all__. The presence of 'export' and 'serve' in __all__ without corresponding definitions or imports suggests either placeholders or incomplete code. No malicious behaviors, such as code injection, data leaks, or suspicious activities, are evident. The code’s simplicity reduces likelihood of hidden malicious intent. Overall, it appears as standard package setup code with a possible omission or placeholder entries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export setup with no apparent malicious intent. The inclusion of 'export' and 'serve' in __all__ without definitions could be a mistake or placeholder, but does not pose a security risk. No malware or security issues are detected.",
