  "purpose": "Defines module exports and imports functions/classes from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module: 'from .module import FluminaModule, main'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points or data leak sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific elements from a local module and declares exports via __all__. It appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and serves as a module interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module import and export declaration with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
