  "purpose": "Define module exports and import specific functions or classes from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "Presence of __all__ assignment indicates module export configuration, no malicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local module and defines an explicit list of exported identifiers. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The import appears standard, and the __all__ list includes identifiers that are presumably defined elsewhere. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
