  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues identified:** References to 'export' and 'serve' in `__all__` without definitions or imports.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes potential incomplete code or obfuscation. No malicious activity or data flow.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is 0, which seems reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Conclusion:** The issues are minor and relate to incomplete references, not malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues identified:** Similar to Report 1, but with higher confidence.\n- **Analysis:** Also finds no malicious behavior; the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, matching the benign assessment.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues identified:** 'export' and 'serve' in `__all__` without definitions.\n- **Analysis:** Slightly more cautious, assigns a small security risk (0.1), possibly due to the missing references.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated is 0, security risk is 0.1, which seems reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just incomplete references.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- **Issues:** None identified; straightforward import and export setup.\n- **Analysis:** Confirmed benign, standard module initialization code.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is minimal and standard. **Estimated malware score: 0.0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected in any report. **Estimated obfuscated score: 0.0**\n- **Risk score:** The only minor concern is the missing 'export' and 'serve' in `__all__`, which could cause runtime errors but not security risks. Given the reports, a small risk score of around 0.05-0.1 seems appropriate, but not higher.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is benign, with only minor issues related to incomplete references.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores should remain at:\n  - **Malware:** 0.0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n  - **Risk:** approximately 0.05 to 0.1, reflecting minor incomplete references but no security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard module setup with incomplete references to 'export' and 'serve' in `__all__`.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The minor issues do not warrant higher risk scores.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.05",
