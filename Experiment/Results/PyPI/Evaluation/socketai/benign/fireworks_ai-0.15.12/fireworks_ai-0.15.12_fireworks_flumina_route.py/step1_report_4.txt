  "purpose": "Define decorators for different HTTP methods to annotate functions with routing information.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'method' and 'path' in the decorator functions, and the decorated functions themselves.",
  "targets": "The '_flumina_route' attribute attached to decorated functions, used at runtime for routing logic.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> gen_wrapper -> wrapper -> function decoration -> attribute assignment",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of typing and standard Python features is typical. No unsafe eval, exec, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of decorator functions to annotate route handlers with HTTP method and path information, storing this data in a '_flumina_route' attribute. The route information is stored in a named tuple. The code uses safe, standard Python features and does not perform any input/output operations, network calls, or data processing that could be malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The design appears typical for web frameworks routing decorators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of route decorators, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and standard in structure.",
