{
  "purpose": "This code defines decorators for HTTP methods and WebSocket routes to annotate functions with routing information.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'method' and 'path' in gen_wrapper, decorator functions receiving 'path' argument.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of '_flumina_route' attribute to functions, potential dynamic behavior if used improperly, but no dangerous sinks present.",
  "flows": "Decorator functions pass 'method' and 'path' to gen_wrapper, which attaches route info to the function object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no unusual or obfuscated code. Use of Literal restricts 'method' values but is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides route decorators for web framework usage, attaching route info to functions via attributes. It uses nested functions, type hints, and standard Python features. No evidence of data leaks, malicious code, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard routing decorator implementation for a web framework, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
