  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining decorators for routing purposes, attaching route metadata to functions.\n- The code is straightforward, using standard Python features, with no external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The 'malware' scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are 0, consistent with the lack of dangerous operations.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input beyond decorating functions; the 'path' and 'method' parameters are static and used solely for metadata.\n- The use of 'Literal' restricts 'method' values, preventing invalid method strings.\n- No anomalies, such as obfuscation or malicious code, are detected.\n\n**Score justifications:**\n- All reports assign 'malware' = 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- 'obfuscated' = 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- 'securityRisk' = 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n\n**Potential improvements or considerations:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no changes are necessary.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security issues detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No further action needed.\n- The code is a standard routing decorator pattern, safe for use in web frameworks.",
