{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators for defining route handlers for different HTTP methods, primarily used in web frameworks or routing configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'method' parameter (via function arguments) and the 'path' parameter, which are used to assign routing metadata to functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data flows into dangerous operations; the code only assigns route metadata to functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('method' and 'path') are used to annotate functions with route information, with no data flowing into system-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and does not contain suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No unusual behavior or anomalies are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and decorators for routing purposes, assigning route info to functions via a custom '_flumina_route' attribute. It uses only safe, static assignments without executing or transforming inputs in dangerous ways. The 'Literal' type restricts 'method' values to specific HTTP methods, preventing invalid inputs. No external data handling, environment variable usage, or network operations are present. The structure is typical for web routing setups and shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple, benign set of decorators for route handling. It does not perform any malicious actions, does not handle untrusted data in dangerous ways, and contains no obfuscation or malware. It is safe and aligns with standard routing pattern implementations.",
