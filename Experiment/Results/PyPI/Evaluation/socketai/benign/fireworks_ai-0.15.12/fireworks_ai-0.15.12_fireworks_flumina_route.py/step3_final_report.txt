  "purpose": "Define route decorators that attach route metadata to functions for web framework routing.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'method' and 'path' used in decorator factory functions.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of '_flumina_route' attribute to functions; no untrusted data processing or external sinks.",
  "flows": "Decorator functions assign metadata directly to functions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines route decorators that annotate functions with route metadata via a NamedTuple. It restricts HTTP methods using 'Literal' and attaches this info as an attribute. No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code is static, simple, and intended for use in web routing configurations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and justified based on the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of route decorators with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, and the scoring is appropriate.",
