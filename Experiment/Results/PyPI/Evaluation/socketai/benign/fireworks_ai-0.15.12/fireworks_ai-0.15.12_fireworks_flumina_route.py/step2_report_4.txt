  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Logical Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines route decorators (`websocket`, `get`, `put`, `post`, `delete`) that attach route metadata to functions via a `_flumina_route` attribute.\n   - The `_FluminaRoute` NamedTuple restricts the `method` to specific HTTP methods using `Literal`.\n   - The decorators are straightforward, with no data processing, network operations, or execution of untrusted code.\n   - The code is static, simple, and intended for use in a web framework or routing configuration.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Content:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and correctly identifies the code as a routing utility.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate since there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues or anomalies are detected that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code's simplicity and static nature do not justify any elevated scores.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is safe, standard, and does not pose security risks.\n   - The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - Since the code only assigns route metadata, it does not process untrusted input or perform dangerous operations.\n   - The use of `Literal` enforces method constraints, preventing invalid method values.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The code is benign and does not require further security review.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
