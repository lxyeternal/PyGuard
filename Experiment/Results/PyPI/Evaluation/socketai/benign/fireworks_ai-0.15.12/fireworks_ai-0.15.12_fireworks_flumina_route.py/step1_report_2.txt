{
  "purpose": "This code defines decorators for routing HTTP and WebSocket methods with specified paths, intended for use in a web framework or server setup.",
  "sources": "The functions receive 'path' and 'method' parameters, which are used to annotate other functions with route information.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns route data to functions via the '_flumina_route' attribute, which could be accessed or manipulated elsewhere; no direct data leakage or insecure operation is present here.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'method' and 'path' flow into the 'gen_wrapper' function, which attaches route info to target functions via attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and pattern-based.",
  "analysis": "The code defines route decorators for different HTTP methods, attaching route information to functions for routing purposes. No external data sources or outputs are involved. The structure is simple and clear, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It does not perform any network operations, data storage, or code execution beyond assigning attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign routing utility used for marking functions with route metadata. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
