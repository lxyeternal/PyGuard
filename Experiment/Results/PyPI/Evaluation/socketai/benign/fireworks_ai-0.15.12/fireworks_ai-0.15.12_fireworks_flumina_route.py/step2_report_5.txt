  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the original code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code defines decorators for routing, attaching route metadata to functions.\n- It uses standard Python features: NamedTuple, decorators, type hints, and Literal.\n- There are no signs of data leaks, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present.\n- The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the code is safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — correct.\n- **Notes:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity; the code is a simple routing decorator.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — correct.\n- **Notes:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Again, no issues; straightforward routing decorators.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — correct.\n- **Notes:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or obfuscation; standard pattern.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — correct.\n- **Notes:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — correct.\n- **Notes:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code's purpose is purely to annotate functions with route info, with no dangerous operations.\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security concerns.\n\n**The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.**",
