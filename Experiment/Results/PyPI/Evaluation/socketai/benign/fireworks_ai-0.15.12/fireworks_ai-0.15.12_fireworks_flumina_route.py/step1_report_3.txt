  "purpose": "This code defines decorators for routing HTTP and websocket methods, attaching route information to functions.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources are present; the code primarily defines functions and decorators.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no data is being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process or transmit data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of literal strings for route methods is standard for routing decorators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple for route data, and decorators to assign route metadata to functions. It uses standard Python features and type annotations. No data is read from external sources, and no network or file operations are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and intended for routing in a web framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for defining route decorators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
