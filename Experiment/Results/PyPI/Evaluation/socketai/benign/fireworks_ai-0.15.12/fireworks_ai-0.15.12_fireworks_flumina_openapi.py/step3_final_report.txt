  "purpose": "Generate cURL commands from an OpenAPI specification, resolving schemas, parameters, and security schemes, with placeholders for user-provided secrets.",
  "sources": "Schema definitions, parameters, security schemes, requestBody content, and path/query parameters in the OpenAPI spec.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform data leaks or execute untrusted code. It generates static command strings with placeholders.",
  "flows": "Schema extraction flows into request body construction, which then integrates into cURL command assembly, incorporating security headers and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholders like <API_KEY>, <token>, <value>, <file> without validation; no actual secrets embedded; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly parses and resolves schemas, handles parameters and security schemes, and generates cURL commands with placeholders. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The placeholders are intended for user substitution, not malicious injection. The schema resolution uses visited_refs to prevent infinite loops. The security schemes are incorporated via placeholders, and request bodies are serialized appropriately. The overall structure is sound and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for generating API request commands from an OpenAPI spec. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is misuse of placeholders if replaced maliciously outside the script, but this is outside its scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and appropriate.",
