  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for generating API request commands from an OpenAPI spec. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is misuse of placeholders if replaced maliciously outside the script, but this is outside its scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and appropriate."
