  "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but contains a critical flaw in the import restriction logic, enabling execution of arbitrary external scripts with environment manipulation. This creates a high security risk if used with untrusted code. The current implementation should be fixed to enforce proper restrictions, and code validation should be added to mitigate potential supply chain or remote code execution threats."
