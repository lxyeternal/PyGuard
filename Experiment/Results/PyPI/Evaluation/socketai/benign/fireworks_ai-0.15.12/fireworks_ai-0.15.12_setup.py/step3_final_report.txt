  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, utilizing environment variable or versioneer for versioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'FIREWORKS_BUILD_VERSION' and versioneer.get_version()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations or external systems",
  "flows": "Environment variable or versioneer's output assigned to 'version' and passed to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for versioning, which could be manipulated if the build environment is compromised, but this is a common practice and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing standard modules, retrieving version info from an environment variable or versioneer, and calling setup(). No network activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The reliance on environment variables introduces a known, acceptable risk of manipulation but does not constitute malicious behavior. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with minimal security concerns. The potential for environment variable manipulation is acknowledged but not malicious. Overall, the code poses no significant security threat.",
