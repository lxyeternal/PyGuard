  "purpose": "Set up the package with version information, either from an environment variable or versioneer's automatic versioning.",
  "sources": "os.getenv(\"FIREWORKS_BUILD_VERSION\") retrieves the build version from environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The environment variable 'FIREWORKS_BUILD_VERSION' could be read, but this does not directly lead to data leakage or malicious effects; it is a benign source.",
  "flows": "The environment variable is used to set the package version, with a fallback to versioneer's version retrieval. No flow leads to data leaks or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code uses standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary setup tools and versioning libraries, retrieves version information from an environment variable or versioneer, and calls setup() with this version. This is typical for package versioning. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
