  "purpose": "Configure package setup with dynamic versioning based on environment variable or versioneer's version.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'FIREWORKS_BUILD_VERSION' using os.getenv.",
  "sinks": "Uses the environment variable value directly for package versioning.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'FIREWORKS_BUILD_VERSION' → version assignment in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variable to set version, which could be manipulated externally, but this is a common practice. No suspicious code execution, network activity, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and versioneer for package setup. It retrieves a version string either from an environment variable or via versioneer. This approach is typical for automated build systems to set version info dynamically. No data is transmitted or processed in a way that indicates malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging that dynamically sets the version based on an environment variable or versioneer. It poses no evident security risks or malicious behavior.",
