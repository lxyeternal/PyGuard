  "purpose": "Configure a custom logger with colored output and environment-based log level.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' for setting log level.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to the console with color formatting.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' → logger.setLevel() → log messages displayed in console.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors observed. Use of environment variable for log level is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ANSI color sequences for log levels, a custom formatter class for colored output, and a singleton logger setup function. The environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' determines the log level, with a default of 'INFO'. The logger outputs to the console with colored formatting. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging configuration with color formatting and environment-based log level control. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It functions solely to provide enhanced console logs.",
