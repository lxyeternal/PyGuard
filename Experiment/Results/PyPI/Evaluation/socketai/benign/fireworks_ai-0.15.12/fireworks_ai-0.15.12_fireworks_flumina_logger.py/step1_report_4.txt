  "purpose": "Configure a custom logger with colored output and dynamic log level based on environment variable.",
  "sources": "Environment variable LOGLEVEL, imported modules (os, logging), code execution in get_logger()",
  "targets": "Logger configuration, environment variables, output formatting",
  "flows": "Reading LOGLEVEL from environment -> setting logger level -> formatting log messages with color codes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls; environment variable used for log level is standard; no malicious code or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom colored log formatter and a singleton logger instance. The environment variable LOGLEVEL controls logging verbosity, which is a common practice. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is purely to enhance logging readability with color coding. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed, and the code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply formats log output with color codes and sets log levels dynamically.",
