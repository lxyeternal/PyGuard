  "purpose": "Configure a custom colored logging setup with environment-configurable log levels for debugging or operational purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' for log level configuration; import statements for logging and os modules.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to standard output stream (console) via StreamHandler.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' → logger.setLevel() → logging output via stream handler.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code does not contain hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging system with color-coded output. It retrieves the log level from an environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' with a default of 'INFO'. The logger is instantiated only once (singleton pattern) and configured with a stream handler that uses a custom formatter for colored output. The environment variable allows dynamic adjustment of log verbosity without hardcoding secrets. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be standard logging configuration with enhanced readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging setup intended for improved log readability with color coding. It responsibly uses environment variables for configuration and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
