  "purpose": "Set up a colored logging system with environment-configurable log level for an application.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable LOGLEVEL; reads from global environment variables; uses standard logging and os modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted log messages to standard output (console).",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOGLEVEL -> logger configuration -> formatted log messages -> console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom colored formatter for logging, retrieves a log level from environment variables, and configures a logger with a stream handler. The environment variable LOGLEVEL is used to determine the log level, which is a common and safe practice. The formatter adds color codes to enhance log readability. The logger setup includes a singleton pattern to avoid multiple configurations. No data is sent externally, no code injection, no use of insecure functions, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate logging setup with no malicious intent. It securely manages logging levels via environment variables and formats logs with color coding for better readability. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious activity.",
