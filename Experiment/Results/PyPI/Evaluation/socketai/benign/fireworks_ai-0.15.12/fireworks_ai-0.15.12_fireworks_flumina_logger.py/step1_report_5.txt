  "purpose": "Configure a custom colored logging system with environment-based log level control.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('LOGLEVEL') for log level configuration; environment variables for dynamic behavior.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to the console via StreamHandler; no data is written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'LOGLEVEL' influences logger level, which affects log message output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Use of environment variable for log level is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines color-coded log formatting and dynamically sets log level from environment variable 'LOGLEVEL'. It creates a singleton logger with a stream handler if not already set. The formatter uses ANSI escape sequences for color output, and the log level can be adjusted without code changes. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, as the code solely handles logging configuration and output. No data leaks, malicious commands, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward logging setup with color formatting and environment-based log level configuration. There are no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.",
