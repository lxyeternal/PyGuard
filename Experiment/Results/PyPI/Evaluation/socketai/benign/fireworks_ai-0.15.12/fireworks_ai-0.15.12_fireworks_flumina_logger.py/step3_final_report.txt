  "purpose": "A logging utility that formats log messages with ANSI color codes based on log level, configurable via environment variable LOGLEVEL.",
  "sources": "Environment variable LOGLEVEL for log level configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Environment variable LOGLEVEL influences logger level; logger outputs formatted messages to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard logging setup with color-coded output, using environment variables for configuration. It employs a singleton pattern for logger instantiation, avoiding multiple handlers. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The use of ANSI escape sequences is benign and aimed at improving log readability. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented logging utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for supply chain use, with scores reflecting minimal security concern.",
