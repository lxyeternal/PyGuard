      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but contains a critical flaw in the import restriction logic, enabling execution of arbitrary external scripts with environment manipulation. This creates a high security risk if used with untrusted code. The current implementation should be fixed to enforce proper restrictions, and code validation should be added to mitigate potential supply chain or remote code execution threats."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for generating API request commands from an OpenAPI spec. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is misuse of placeholders if replaced maliciously outside the script, but this is outside its scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and appropriate."

The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) reflecting operational considerations rather than threats."

The malware and obfuscation scores are 0; the security risk score is approximately 0.1 to reflect minor incomplete references but no security concern."
