  "purpose": "Manages API keys and configuration data via environment variables and ini files, providing functions to load, set, and retrieve API keys.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables (FIREWORKS_API_KEY, API_KEY), reads from ini file (~/.fireworks/auth.ini), reads file content for loading configuration.",
  "sinks": "Writes to ini file (~/.fireworks/auth.ini), updates 'api_key' line in the ini file, logs info messages.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> get_api_key() -> returns API key; File read (load_from_ini) -> loads config values; set_api_key() -> writes API key to ini file.",
  "anomalies": "Stores API keys in plaintext in ini files; no encryption or obfuscation; no validation or sanitization of input; potential for misuse if secrets are exposed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward management of API keys via environment variables and configuration files. It reads and writes configuration data without encryption, which is a security concern but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions handle secrets in plaintext, which is common but not ideal. The code does not contain any backdoors, code injection, or malicious behavior. The logic is simple and adheres to standard practices for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration utility for managing API keys, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the plaintext storage of secrets, which is a known issue but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the plaintext storage but no malicious intent.",
