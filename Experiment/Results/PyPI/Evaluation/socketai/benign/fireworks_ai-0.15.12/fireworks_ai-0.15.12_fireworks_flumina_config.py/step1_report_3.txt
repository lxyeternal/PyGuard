  "purpose": "Manage and retrieve API keys and configuration settings for authentication, including reading from and writing to an ini configuration file.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration from ini file, environment variables, and file system checks.",
  "sinks": "Writing API key data back to ini file; accessing environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (FIREWORKS_API_KEY or API_KEY) -> check for existing ini file -> load from ini -> return API key; write API key to ini file if updated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; no suspicious file or network activity. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns. The code properly handles missing sections and creates directories as needed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages API keys via environment variables and configuration files. It reads and updates ini files with proper checks. The only data handling involves configuration management, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The use of environment variables is standard, and there is no evidence of data leakage or malicious data transmission. Functions are straightforward and do not perform any network activity or sensitive data exfiltration. The code appears legitimate and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and secret management utility without malicious intent. It securely handles API keys, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
