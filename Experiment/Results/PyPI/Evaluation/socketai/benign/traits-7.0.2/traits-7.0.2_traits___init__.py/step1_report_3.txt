  "purpose": "To determine the version of the 'traits' library or handle its absence gracefully.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'traits.version' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only sets a version variable.",
  "flows": "Import attempt flows to exception handling, setting '__version__' accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for optional dependency import with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version string from a third-party library 'traits'. If the import fails, it sets '__version__' to 'unknown'. This pattern is common for optional dependencies, with exception handling to ensure stability if the module isn't available. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or potentially harmful code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import with fallback handling, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
