  "purpose": "Attempt to import 'traits.version' and assign its 'version' attribute to '__version__'; fallback to 'unknown' if import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'traits.version' and the except block handling ImportError.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to '__version__' variable; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from 'traits.version' to assignment of '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import with fallback, no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard optional dependency import with a fallback to a default value. It contains no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, and no malicious activity. The try-except pattern is common for handling optional modules. No external data flows or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and safe. It correctly handles missing dependencies without any malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
