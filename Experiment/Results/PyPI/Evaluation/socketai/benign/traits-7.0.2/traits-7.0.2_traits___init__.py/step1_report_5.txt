  "purpose": "Define and retrieve the version of the traits package, with fallback handling if the import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'traits.version' and fallback assignment of '__version__' variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'traits.version' -> fallback to assigning 'unknown' to '__version__' if ImportError occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a fallback mechanism for import failure, which is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily tries to import a module for versioning information. If the import fails, it assigns a default string to '__version__'. The try-except block is standard practice for handling optional or missing dependencies. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version import with error handling. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
