  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches exactly; no modifications or malicious code detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, as expected. The confidence is high (1). No adjustments needed.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code is benign.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence is 1.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern; no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence is 1.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Identical logic; no issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence is 1.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; straightforward import with fallback.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is 0. Confidence is slightly lower at 0.9, which is acceptable given the standard pattern.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of analysis:\n- All reports describe the same benign, standard version detection pattern.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as the code is straightforward and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, given the benign nature and lack of security issues.\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate in their conclusions, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.",
