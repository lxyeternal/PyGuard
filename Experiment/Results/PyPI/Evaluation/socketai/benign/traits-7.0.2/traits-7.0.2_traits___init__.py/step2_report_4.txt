  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippet is a standard pattern for optional dependency import with a fallback.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration.\n- The logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, and anomalies.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — correct.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above; correctly describes the code.\n- **Analysis:** Valid; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; correctly states the code's purpose.\n- **Analysis:** Valid; no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Correctly describes the import and fallback.\n- **Analysis:** Valid; standard pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; standard import with fallback.\n- **Analysis:** Valid; no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — correct.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — slightly less, but still acceptable given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The logic in all reports is sound, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n- **malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a standard, safe pattern for optional dependency handling.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.
