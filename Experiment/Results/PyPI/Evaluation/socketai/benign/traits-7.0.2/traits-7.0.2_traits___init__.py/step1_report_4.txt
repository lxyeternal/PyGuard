  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a version identifier from a traits library, with fallback to a default value if import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement from traits.version",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import from traits.version → fallback to __version__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code handles import errors gracefully and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the 'traits.version' module can be imported to retrieve a version string. If the import fails, it assigns '__version__' to 'unknown'. This is a standard pattern for handling optional dependencies or development environments. No external data inputs or outputs are involved, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and safe attempt to retrieve the package version, with error handling for missing dependencies. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
