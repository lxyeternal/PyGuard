  "purpose": "To determine the version of the traits library, or set a default value if not available.",
  "sources": "Import statement from traits.version and potential fallback to a string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import of traits.version flows into the assignment of __version__, fallback to a string if ImportError occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to handle ImportError is standard; no suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version identifier from the traits library. If the import fails, it sets __version__ to 'unknown'. This pattern is typical for optional dependencies and version checks. No external data transmission, no malicious logic, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for version detection with fallback. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
