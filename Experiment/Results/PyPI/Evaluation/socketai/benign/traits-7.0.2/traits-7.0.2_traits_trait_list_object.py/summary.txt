  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an observable, validated list within the Traits framework. It contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary potential security concern is the extensibility via user-defined notifier functions, which could be malicious if misused, but this is an intended feature rather than a flaw. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2)."
