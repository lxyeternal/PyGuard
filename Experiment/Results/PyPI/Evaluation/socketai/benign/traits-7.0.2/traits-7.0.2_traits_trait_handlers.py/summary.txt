  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured trait validation framework component. No malware or obfuscation detected. The only notable risk is from dynamic class resolution if inputs are untrusted, which is a common pattern but warrants caution. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
