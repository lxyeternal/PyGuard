  "purpose": "Utility functions, singleton objects, configuration handling, path management, and reflection for the Traits package.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations, environment variables, module attributes, and call stack frames.",
  "sinks": "Attribute access, filesystem paths, environment variables, and module data.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables and call stack frames flow into attribute access and filesystem functions, with no evidence of data leaks or malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys._getframe and broad exception handling in verify_path are standard for introspection and robustness, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions, singleton objects, and configuration/path management routines typical for internal library support. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of reflection and singleton patterns is standard for such internal modules. Exception handling is broad but appropriate for filesystem operations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured utility code for internal use within the Traits package. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code content.",
