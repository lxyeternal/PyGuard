  "conclusion": "The dependency is a legitimate, standard traits notification system with no malicious intent or sabotage. The scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are justified given the callback pattern and handler execution. Overall, it is safe for production use assuming handlers are trusted or sandboxed."
