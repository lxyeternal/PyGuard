  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and systematically.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n   - All reports indicate that the code is solely a comment with no executable code, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - There are no actual code constructs, functions, or logic present.\n   - Therefore, no issues such as malware, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are present in the code snippet.\n\n2. Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in stating that the code contains only a comment.\n   - No flaws are evident; the reasoning is sound.\n   - The conclusion that there are no security risks is appropriate given the content.\n\n3. Review the scores assigned:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the absence of executable code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty based on the minimal snippet.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate since there's no code to obfuscate.\n\n4. Justify risk scores higher than 0.5:\n   - Since there is no executable code, no data flows, and no suspicious patterns, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain low.\n\n5. Challenge any claims based on assumptions:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize the code is only a comment.\n   - No unwarranted suspicion is present.\n\n6. Consistency of scores:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - Given the content, the scores accurately reflect the absence of risks.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code snippet is merely a comment indicating an intention to turn the module into a Django app.\n- There is no executable code, data flow, or malicious activity.\n- Malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores should all be **0**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual content of the code snippet.",
