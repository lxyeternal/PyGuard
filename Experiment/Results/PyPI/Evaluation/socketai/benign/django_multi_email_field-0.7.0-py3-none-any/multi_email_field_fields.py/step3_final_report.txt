{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Django model field 'MultiEmailField' for storing multiple email addresses as multiline text, delegating validation to an external form class.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; reads data from database and form inputs via Django ORM methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is stored and retrieved via standard Django model methods without external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from form input through 'formfield' validation, stored as text in the database, and converted back to list on retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. Minor point: 'get_db_prep_value' lacks an explicit return for non-str/list types, but this does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django custom field implementation for handling multiple emails. It uses common patterns: converts list to string for storage, splits string into list for retrieval, and delegates validation to an external form class. No external network calls, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The reliance on an external form class for validation is typical and does not introduce security issues unless that form is insecure, which is outside this scope. The code does not perform any dangerous operations, and the methods handle data safely. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented Django model field for storing multiple emails. It does not contain malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
