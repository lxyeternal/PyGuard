  "purpose": "Define a custom Django model field for storing multiple email addresses as multiline text.",
  "sources": "Initialization (__init__), formfield method, from_db_value, get_db_prep_value, to_python",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are evident; data is processed internally and passed to Django ORM.",
  "flows": "Input data from database or form -> processing in from_db_value, to_python, get_db_prep_value -> stored or retrieved as list or string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a custom Django model field for storing multiple email addresses, converting between list and multiline string formats. It relies on an external form class for validation but does not contain any network operations, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No anomalies or malicious intent are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Django practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a custom Django model field without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
