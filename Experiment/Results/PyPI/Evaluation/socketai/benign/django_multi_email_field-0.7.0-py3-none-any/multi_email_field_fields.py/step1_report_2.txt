  "purpose": "Define a custom Django model field for handling multiple email addresses stored as multiline text.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input; the code interacts with database and form data, primarily internal data processing.",
  "sinks": "Database storage via get_db_prep_value, form rendering via formfield, and data conversion methods.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database to application and back through from_db_value, to_python, and get_db_prep_value methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious variables. The code appears to implement standard custom field logic without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django custom model field for multiple emails, including methods for initializing, form representation, database conversion, and Python object conversion. It uses an external form class for input validation. No external input reading beyond Django's standard flow is observed. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward, adheres to Django conventions, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a custom Django model field for multi-email input without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe extension of Django's ORM functionalities.",
