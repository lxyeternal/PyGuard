  "purpose": "Define a custom Django model field for storing multiple email addresses as multiline text.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from database retrieval (from_db_value), form submissions (formfield), and direct assignment (to_python).",
  "sinks": "The code converts data to and from database format, with no external output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (database/form data) through conversion methods (from_db_value, to_python) and storage back to database, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code mainly handles data formatting and does not perform external actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django custom field for multi-email storage, converting between list and multiline string formats for database interaction. It imports a third-party form class, but does not execute any network or system commands. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or security-critical vulnerabilities are present. The methods are standard for custom Django fields and do not perform dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard custom Django model field for handling multiple email addresses. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
