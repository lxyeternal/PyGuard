  "purpose": "Define a custom Django model field for storing multiple email addresses as multiline text.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from database (via from_db_value, to_python), and form input (via formfield).",
  "sinks": "Database storage (get_db_prep_value), form rendering (formfield), data processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database or user input through conversion methods (from_db_value, to_python, get_db_prep_value) into stored format, and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious operations detected. The code is straightforward, primarily handling string/list conversions. No external data fetching or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a Django custom model field for storing multiple email addresses. Methods handle conversion between list and multiline string for database storage, and integrate with Django forms. Usage of 'multi_email_field' form class is standard. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or external network activity. The code appears to be a standard custom field implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom Django model field with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data formatting and conversion tasks securely. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
