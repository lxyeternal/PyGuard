  "purpose": "Define a custom Django model field for storing multiple email addresses as multiline text.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; uses Django ORM methods for database interactions.",
  "sinks": "Database operations for saving and retrieving data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from form input to database storage and back, with internal conversion between list and string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses standard Django field patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django model field 'MultiEmailField' that handles multiple email addresses stored as multiline text. It overrides methods to convert between list and string representations for database storage and form handling. It imports a form class for email validation, but does not itself implement validation or sanitization. No untrusted data input sources, external network calls, or suspicious code execution paths are present. The code does not perform any insecure operations or include hidden malicious logic. It is a straightforward custom field implementation with standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a custom Django model field without external dependencies or network activity. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.",
