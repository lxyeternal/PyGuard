{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that retrieves and prints the current system's hostname and IP address.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's hostname and IP address using the socket library functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console; no untrusted data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system calls (gethostname, gethostbyname) directly to print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of suspicious libraries or network connections. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no unusual variable names.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python libraries to fetch system network information. It does not process untrusted input or write data externally. The code's behavior is straightforward and typical for network information retrieval. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modification. The simplicity and lack of external data handling indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic network information retrieval script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It poses no threat and appears to be safe for use.",
