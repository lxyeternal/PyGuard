  "purpose": "The code implements Django form, model, and widget tests for a multi-email input field, validating email parsing, rendering, and storage.",
  "sources": "Form data inputs, initial data, model defaults, and validation methods.",
  "sinks": "Validation routines, rendering output, database storage, and data filtering.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Validation and parsing -> Storage or rendering output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Django testing practices, third-party libraries (pyquery), and straightforward validation logic. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation detected. Validation methods correctly handle various input formats. Tests verify rendering, default values, and data cleaning. No signs of malicious behavior or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, benign testing and form handling code with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and justified.",
