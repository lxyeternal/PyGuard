  "purpose": "Define a Django model with fields for storing multiple email addresses.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; the code defines a model and imports a field type.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only field definitions with default values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MultiEmailField with a default value is standard, but the default is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django models and a custom email field, then defines a model with two email fields. One field allows null and blank, the other has a default email address. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The default value is a static email address, which is typical for placeholder or testing purposes. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward Django model definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It only defines data fields for emails, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
