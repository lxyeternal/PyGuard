  "purpose": "Defines a Django model with two MultiEmailField fields, one with a default email list.",
  "sources": "Model field definitions; no external input sources or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; purely data structure definition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mutable default list in 'f_default' field; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django model with third-party MultiEmailField usage. No input/output operations, network calls, or suspicious logic are present. The default list is static, which is typical, though ideally should be a callable to avoid shared mutable defaults. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The default value is benign, and the code adheres to standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The default list is static but not harmful. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
