  "purpose": "Define a Django model with multi-email fields for storing multiple email addresses.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; model fields may receive data from user input or external sources when the model is used.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in the database; potential for data leakage if misused, but no direct sink for untrusted data in the code itself.",
  "flows": "User input flows into the MultiEmailField fields through Django forms or ORM methods; no explicit flows shown in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors observed. Usage of MultiEmailField with default values appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django models and a custom MultiEmailField, then defines a TestModel with two email fields, one with a default value. There is no input/output handling, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. The fields appear to be used for storing email addresses with validation handled by MultiEmailField. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django model definition for storing multiple email addresses. It contains no malicious behavior or security issues based on the provided snippet.",
