  "purpose": "Define a Django model with fields for multiple email addresses.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as no input/output handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MultiEmailField with default value specified as a list; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django models and a custom MultiEmailField. It defines a Django model with two fields: one allows null and blank values, the other has a default email list. No input handling, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations are present. The default value is a static list of emails, which is benign. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or security risks. The usage appears straightforward and typical for a Django application using custom fields.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple Django model definition with a custom email field; it does not contain malicious behavior or security issues.",
