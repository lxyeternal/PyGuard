  "purpose": "Define a Django model with multi-email fields for storing multiple email addresses.",
  "sources": "Import statements from Django and multi_email_field library; model field definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted input handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Model initialization and data storage through MultiEmailField instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a Django model with two fields of type MultiEmailField. The fields accept null and blank values, with one having a default email address. The use of a third-party library 'multi_email_field' appears legitimate for managing multiple email addresses. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The code strictly defines data structure without external data manipulation or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a straightforward Django model definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard patterns and a common third-party library appropriately.",
