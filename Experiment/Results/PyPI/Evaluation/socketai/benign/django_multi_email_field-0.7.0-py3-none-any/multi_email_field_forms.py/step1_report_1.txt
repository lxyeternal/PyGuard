  "purpose": "Define a custom Django form field for handling multiple email addresses with validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'value' parameter in 'to_python' and 'validate' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code validates email addresses using 'validate_email'; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed in 'to_python', split into list of emails, then validated in 'validate' method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. No unsafe code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly converts input into a list of emails, trims whitespace, and validates each email address. It uses Django's built-in validation functions securely. No external data is fetched, nor does the code perform network operations or data exfiltration. The widget is imported but not manipulated for malicious purposes. The overall structure and logic align with standard practices for form validation in Django.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a multi-email input form field with validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is safe and follows best practices for input validation within Django forms.",
