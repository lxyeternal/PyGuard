  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for handling multiple email inputs in Django forms. It performs input normalization and validation securely without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate; given the code's simplicity and safety, a conservative security risk score of 0 is justified."
