  "purpose": "Provides a Django form field for inputting multiple email addresses, normalizing input, and validating each email address using Django's built-in validator.",
  "sources": "Input string from the user, split into lines for processing.",
  "sinks": "Validation function validate_email for each email; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input string -> splitlines -> strip whitespace -> validate_email for each email.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard validation logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django form field that accepts multiple email addresses, normalizes them by splitting lines and trimming whitespace, and validates each email with Django's validate_email. It uses standard Django validation mechanisms, imports a custom widget without manipulating it maliciously, and includes proper exception handling. No external data fetching, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is clear, readable, and follows best practices, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for handling multiple email inputs in Django forms. It performs input normalization and validation securely without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate; given the code's simplicity and safety, a conservative security risk score of 0 is justified.",
