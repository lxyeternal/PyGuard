  "purpose": "Custom Django form field for handling multiple email addresses input.",
  "sources": "Input data from form submissions, specifically the value parameter in to_python method.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions (validate_email), potential exceptions raised during validation.",
  "flows": "User input -> to_python (parsing and normalizing email list) -> validate (email validation) -> exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of standard Django validation functions. No unusual or suspicious code structures or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django form field that accepts multiple email addresses, normalizes input by splitting lines, and validates each email using Django's validate_email. It correctly handles empty inputs and raises validation errors for invalid emails. No indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present. The code relies on standard Django validation mechanisms and a custom widget, which is typical for such use cases. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a multi-email input field for Django forms, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs expected validation and input normalization without any security concerns.",
