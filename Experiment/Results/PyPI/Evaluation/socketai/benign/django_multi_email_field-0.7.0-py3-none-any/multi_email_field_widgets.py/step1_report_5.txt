{
  "purpose": "Custom Django widget for handling multiple email addresses input as text area.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from form submissions or programmatic assignment to the widget.",
  "sinks": "Rendering output via the superclass render method; validation errors are raised on invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into prep_value, which processes it; processed data flows into render method for display.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ValidationError within prep_value is typical; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django widget inheriting from Textarea, with methods to prepare and validate email input. The prep_value method sanitizes input, converting lists to newline-separated strings and handling empty values. The render method calls prep_value before rendering. No external data sources, no data leaks, and no unsafe code or malicious behavior identified. The use of ValidationError is standard for validation, not an indicator of malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom Django form widget for multiple emails, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
