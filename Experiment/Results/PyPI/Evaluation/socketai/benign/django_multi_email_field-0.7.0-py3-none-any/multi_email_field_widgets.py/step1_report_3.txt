{
  "purpose": "A custom Django form widget for handling multiple email inputs, formatted as a textarea.",
  "sources": "Input values passed to prep_value() and render() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that process untrusted data for security-sensitive operations such as network access, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Input values are processed in prep_value() and then rendered in render(). No external data is fetched or transmitted, and no untrusted data is executed or stored beyond display.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard Django validators and widget methods without any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. The validation error message is generic, but that is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The widget class extends Django's Textarea to handle multiple email addresses. The prep_value() method converts input values to a string for display, handling empty values, strings, and lists. It raises a ValidationError for invalid formats. The render() method calls prep_value() before rendering. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or insecure operations. The code is straightforward and adheres to Django conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard custom Django form widget for handling multiple emails. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
