{
  "purpose": "A Django widget for multi-email input that converts list or string inputs into a newline-separated string for display and validates input format.",
  "sources": "Input value passed to prep_value(), potentially from form data or initial data.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the widget's prep_value() method, which processes the value before rendering.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ValidationError in prep_value() is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django widget that handles input conversion and validation without performing any network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The use of ValidationError during value preparation is atypical but not malicious. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django widget with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
