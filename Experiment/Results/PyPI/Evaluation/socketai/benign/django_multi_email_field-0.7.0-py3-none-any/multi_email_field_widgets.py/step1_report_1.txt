{
  "purpose": "A Django widget for multi-email input, converting list or string inputs into a text area for user input.",
  "sources": "The code reads input values via the 'prep_value' method, which takes 'value' as an argument.",
  "sinks": "The 'render' method outputs the processed value to be displayed in HTML; no untrusted data is directly written elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to 'prep_value', which sanitizes and converts it into a string, then passed to 'render' for display.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ValidationError' in 'prep_value' for invalid formats; no use of dangerous dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django widget to handle multiple email inputs. It processes the input 'value' to convert lists or strings into a text area string. It raises validation errors if input is not in expected formats. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration logic present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Use of standard Django patterns and no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign Django widget implementation for multi-email input, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
