It utilizes Django's validation framework properly. No suspicious behaviors, external network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward and appears legitimate with standard usage patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom widget for multi-email input in Django forms. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It effectively handles value preparation and rendering with proper validation. No security concerns or malware indicators detected.",
