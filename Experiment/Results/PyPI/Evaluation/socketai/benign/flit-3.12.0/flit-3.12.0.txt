      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured package upload utility with appropriate security practices. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the potential for credential mishandling if environment security is compromised, but overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard project scaffolding utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify the absence of malware and obfuscation. The risk scores, mostly around 0.1, are appropriate given the minimal inherent risks of user prompts and filesystem operations. I recommend setting malware and obfuscated scores to 0, and the overall security risk to 0, to accurately reflect the benign nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI utility for managing Python packages. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess call used for path resolution is a common pattern and does not pose a significant security risk in normal environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The code can be considered safe and trustworthy."

The slight security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are unwarranted given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious operations. The overall security profile is very low, and the code can be considered safe."
