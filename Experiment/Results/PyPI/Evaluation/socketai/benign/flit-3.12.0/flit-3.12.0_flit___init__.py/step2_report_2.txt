  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a CLI tool for packaging, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The subprocess call in `find_python_executable()` is standard for resolving the absolute path of a Python interpreter, and no suspicious activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The overall evaluation aligns with the code's behavior. The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the standard use of subprocess for path resolution, with no signs of malicious activity. The mention of potential concern if the Python interpreter is compromised is valid but unlikely in typical environments.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** It emphasizes the standard nature of argument parsing and subprocess calls, with no malicious intent. The concern about the subprocess call is acknowledged but deemed low risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly interprets the code as benign.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** It correctly identifies the subprocess call in `find_python_executable()` as a potential minor concern but notes that it's standard practice and unlikely to be exploited maliciously.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The overall assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report recognizes the code's standard approach, with no signs of malicious activity. The subprocess call is used solely for local path resolution.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal potential concern over subprocess usage for path resolution, but generally low.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to subprocess use for path resolution, which is common but could be slightly risky if environment is compromised.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments to scores or reasoning are necessary. The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
