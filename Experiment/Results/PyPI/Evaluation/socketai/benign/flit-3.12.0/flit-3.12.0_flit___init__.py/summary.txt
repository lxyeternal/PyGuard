  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI utility for managing Python packages. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess call used for path resolution is a common pattern and does not pose a significant security risk in normal environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The code can be considered safe and trustworthy."
