  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface to initialize and manage project defaults, licenses, and configuration files for Python projects, including generating a pyproject.toml file.",
  "sources": "File system access (os, Path, glob), user input (input prompts), environment variables (os.environ), reading license templates, reading and writing JSON files, reading readme files.",
  "sinks": "Reading license templates and writing license files, writing pyproject.toml, reading environment variables, reading and writing JSON configuration files, user input validation.",
  "flows": "User input prompts to gather project info -> updating defaults and writing configuration files -> reading license templates -> writing license files -> generating pyproject.toml based on collected data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code observed. No hardcoded secrets, no network connections, no unusual code behaviors. Code functions as a project initialization helper with proper validation and file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs project setup tasks, including obtaining default values, validating inputs, selecting licenses, generating configuration files, and writing license texts. It uses environment variables to determine data directories, employs input validation for emails and URLs, and manages license templates. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity is present. The file operations are standard and limited to project setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate project initialization utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, suspicious data leaks, or malicious network activity. Its purpose is to facilitate project setup safely.",
