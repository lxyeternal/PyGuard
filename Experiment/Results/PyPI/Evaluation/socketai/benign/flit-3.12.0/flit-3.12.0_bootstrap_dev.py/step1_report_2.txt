{
  "purpose": "This script is used to bootstrap the installation of the 'flit' package and its core, enabling development with symlinks or appropriate files depending on the operating system.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line argument '--user', reading the script's own directory, and configuration files 'pyproject.toml' and 'flit_core/pyproject.toml'",
  "sinks": "The installation process potentially modifies the Python environment by linking files or creating .pth files in site-packages, but no untrusted data or external network activity occurs",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--user' influences installation method; the script reads configuration files to determine installation steps; Installer methods perform the installation actions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code straightforwardly installs packages and manages symlinks or .pth files as per OS",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles local filesystem operations for package installation. It reads configuration files and installs 'flit' and 'flit_core' accordingly. There is no code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior. Usage of sys.path modification and installer calls is typical for bootstrap scripts. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard bootstrap installation for the 'flit' package, adjusting for OS differences. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
