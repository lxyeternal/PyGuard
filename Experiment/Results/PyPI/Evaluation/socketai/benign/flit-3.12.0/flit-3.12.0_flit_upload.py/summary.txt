  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured package upload utility with appropriate security practices. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the potential for credential mishandling if environment security is compromised, but overall, the code is safe and trustworthy."
