  "purpose": "Build both wheel and sdist distributions for a Python package using configuration files and filesystem operations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration file (ini_file), list of formats, and files extracted from tarballs.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (creating directories, extracting tarballs, building distributions), subprocess-like calls (via imported functions), logging.",
  "flows": "Configuration file -> validation and reading; tarball extraction -> temporary directory; build functions -> output files; error handling -> sys.exit.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TemporaryDirectory for extracting tarballs; no hardcoded credentials; no network activity or suspicious code. The code appears standard and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily orchestrating build processes: reading config, creating directories, extracting tarballs, and invoking build functions. It uses standard library modules and explicitly imported project functions. No untrusted input handling appears vulnerable; no dynamic code execution or network activity. The tarball unpacking is cautious and confined within a temporary directory, minimizing risk. No suspicious or malicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The overall structure and behavior align with typical build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate build operations for Python packages without any indications of malicious intent. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior. It appears safe based on the provided fragment.",
