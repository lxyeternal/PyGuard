  "purpose": "Builds Python package distributions (wheel and sdist).",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files, tarball files, filesystem directories, environment variables, and function inputs.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations (directory creation, extraction), build functions, logging, and process termination.",
  "flows": "Reads config -> validates formats -> creates directories -> loads config -> builds sdist -> extracts tarball -> builds wheel -> returns build info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, assertions are standard validation checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package build procedures with proper validation and safe filesystem handling. No network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. External modules are assumed trusted. Use of assertions is typical for validation. No obfuscation or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe build utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
