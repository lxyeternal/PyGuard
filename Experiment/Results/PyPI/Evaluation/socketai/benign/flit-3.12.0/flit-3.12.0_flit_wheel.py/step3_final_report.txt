  "purpose": "A minimal wrapper around core_wheel.make_wheel_in and a subclass of core_wheel.WheelBuilder, delegating functionality without modifications.",
  "sources": "Parameters ini_path, wheel_directory, editable passed to core_wheel.make_wheel_in",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network, or file operations",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into core_wheel.make_wheel_in without validation or processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward delegation, no obfuscation, no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and an external module, defines a wrapper function that forwards parameters, and a subclass extending an external class with no modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or risky data handling. The delegation to an external module does not inherently introduce security issues unless that module is compromised, which is outside this code's scope. The code's simplicity indicates a benign purpose, serving as a thin wrapper for packaging or build processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward wrapper with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores indicating malware and obfuscation are correct at 0. The slight security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are unwarranted given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious operations. The overall security profile is very low, and the code can be considered safe.",
