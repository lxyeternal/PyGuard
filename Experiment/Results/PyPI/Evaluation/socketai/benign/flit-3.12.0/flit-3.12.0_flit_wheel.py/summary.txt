  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward wrapper with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores indicating malware and obfuscation are correct at 0. The slight security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports are unwarranted given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious operations. The overall security profile is very low, and the code can be considered safe."
