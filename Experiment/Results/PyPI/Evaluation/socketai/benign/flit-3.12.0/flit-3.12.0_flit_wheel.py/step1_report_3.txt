{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to facilitate the creation of Python wheel packages using the core_wheel module from flit_core.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters ini_path, wheel_directory, and editable, which are used as arguments for the make_wheel_in function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data directly or write to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed directly to core_wheel.make_wheel_in without validation; however, there is no data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports a third-party module (flit_core.wheel) and defines a simple wrapper function and subclass without additional logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports logging and a core wheel module, then defines a wrapper function make_wheel_in that calls the corresponding function in core_wheel. It also defines a subclass WheelBuilder inheriting from core_wheel.WheelBuilder but adds no extra functionality. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or unusual code constructs. The code acts as a straightforward interface to the core_wheel module, which is typical in packaging tools. No anomalies, no suspicious data handling, and no malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious wrapper around the core_wheel functionality for creating wheel packages. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
