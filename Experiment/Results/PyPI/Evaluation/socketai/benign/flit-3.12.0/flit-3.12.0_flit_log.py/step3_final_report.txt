  "purpose": "Implements a colorful log formatter for Python's logging module, enhancing readability with terminal color support.",
  "sources": "sys.stderr, curses module (for terminal capability detection)",
  "sinks": "Formatted log messages output to standard error stream",
  "flows": "Log message generation -> color support check -> message formatting with color codes",
  "anomalies": "None; standard use of curses for terminal detection, no suspicious code or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a colorful logging formatter. It checks for curses support, initializes color codes, and formats messages accordingly. No untrusted data sources, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The use of curses is for terminal capability detection, a common practice. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, open-source utility for colored logging with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
