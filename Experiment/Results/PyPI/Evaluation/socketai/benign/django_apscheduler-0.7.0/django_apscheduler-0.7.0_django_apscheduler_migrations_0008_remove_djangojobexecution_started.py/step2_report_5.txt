  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Django migration script that removes a field ('started') from the 'djangojobexecution' model.\n- The code is static, auto-generated, and involves no external input, output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n- The code's purpose is purely schema modification, with no indication of security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the code's function.\n- Confidence levels are high (1.0), indicating the reviewers agree on the benign assessment.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The only minor point is the 'securityRisk' score of 0.1 in report 2, which might be slightly overstated given the benign nature of the code. But this is a very minor concern and not necessarily unreasonable.\n- The overall assessment is consistent across reports.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, auto-generated Django migration script with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's function.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk involved)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis is a routine schema migration with no security issues. The provided scores and analysis are appropriate.",
