  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Django migration script that removes a field ('started') from the 'djangojobexecution' model.\n- The code is static, auto-generated, and does not process external inputs or perform any network or file operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The operations are schema modifications, which are common in application evolution.\n\n**Specific review of scores:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - *Assessment:* Fully benign, standard migration. Scores are appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security risk: 0.1\n   - Confidence: 1.0\n   - *Assessment:* Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) for a schema migration with no malicious indicators. Since no external data or code execution occurs, this is probably overstated. The score could be lowered to 0.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - *Assessment:* Appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - *Assessment:* Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security risk: 0\n   - Confidence: 1\n   - *Assessment:* Appropriate.\n\n**Overall:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only questionable score is the minor security risk (0.1) in report 2, which appears to be an overestimate given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n**Malware score:**\n- Clearly 0 across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports correctly assign 0; code is straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. The 0.1 in report 2 should be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores in all reports are reasonable, except for report 2's security risk. I suggest adjusting report 2's security risk score from 0.1 to 0.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, standard Django migration script.\n- No malicious or security risks are present.\n- Minor score adjustments are recommended for consistency.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
