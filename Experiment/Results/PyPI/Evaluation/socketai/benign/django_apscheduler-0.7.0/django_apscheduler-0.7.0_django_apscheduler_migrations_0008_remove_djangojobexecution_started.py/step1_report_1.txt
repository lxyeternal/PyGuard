{
  "purpose": "The code is a Django migration script that modifies the database schema by removing a field from a model.",
  "sources": "The code reads static module data (import statements, migration dependencies, migration operations). It does not read external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network operations, or use of untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks. The migration operates on internal model schema modifications.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for a Django migration script.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard Django migration file generated by the framework. It specifies a dependency on a prior migration and defines an operation to remove a field ('started') from the 'djangojobexecution' model. There are no signs of suspicious or malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not interact with external inputs or outputs, nor does it perform any system modifications beyond database schema changes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign Django migration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
