  "purpose": "Defines a Django application configuration class for the 'django_apscheduler' app.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes 'name' and 'verbose_name' assigned within the class; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static Django AppConfig subclass with fixed attributes. It contains no dynamic code, user input, external data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django app configuration with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
