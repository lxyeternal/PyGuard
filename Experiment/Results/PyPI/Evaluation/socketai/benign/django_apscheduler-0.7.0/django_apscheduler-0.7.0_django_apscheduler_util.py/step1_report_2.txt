  "purpose": "Utility functions and decorators for handling datetime formatting, timezone conversions, and robust database connection management in a Django environment, particularly integrated with APScheduler.",
  "sources": "import statements, functions accessing settings, timezone, and database modules, decorators wrapping functions with database connection handling",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to files, send data over the network, or execute system commands; no untrusted data sinks are apparent",
  "flows": "No untrusted input sources are explicitly processed or passed to external systems; decorators handle database errors and connection management but do not leak data or perform malicious actions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; functions perform straightforward datetime formatting and database connection handling, with no signs of malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for datetime formatting and timezone adjustments based on Django settings, along with decorators for handling database connection errors and ensuring proper connection closure. These functions use standard Django and Python libraries, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or backdoors. The decorators are for improving stability and do not leak data or execute malicious commands. The code appears legitimate and intended solely for reliable scheduler operation within Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for managing datetime formatting and database connections in Django, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is well-structured and uses appropriate safeguards for database stability. Overall, it is safe and does not pose any security threats.",
