  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for datetime formatting, timezone handling, and database connection error retries. No suspicious code or malicious activity observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature, but considering the database retry logic, it might be justified as a minimal risk surface.  \n- Malware score is appropriately zero.  \n- The confidence is high, and no obfuscation is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, focusing on date/time and database connection management, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Consistent with Report 1, the code is straightforward and safe.  \n- The securityRisk score remains low, justified by the lack of malicious activity.  \n- Malware remains zero, as expected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same utility functions, with emphasis on the safe handling of database errors and timezone adjustments. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Fully aligned with previous assessments.  \n- The securityRisk score remains low, appropriate given the benign code.  \n- Malware is correctly scored as zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and decorators for datetime and database connection management, no suspicious or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Slightly lower securityRisk score (0.1) compared to others, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.  \n- Malware remains zero.  \n- Overall consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Perfectly aligned with the code's purpose and safety profile.  \n- No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Security risk:** The scores range from 0 to 0.2, which seems reasonable. The only minor point is the database retry logic, which could be exploited if the code were malicious, but in this context, it's standard and safe.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or backdoors)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Security risk:** Given the code's nature, I would set this at **0.1** — very low, just acknowledging the retry logic that could, in theory, be misused if the code were malicious, but in practice, it's standard.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of utility functions and decorators for date/time handling and database connection robustness in a Django environment, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though I would slightly lower the security risk to 0.1 to reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose, implementation, and observed behavior.",
