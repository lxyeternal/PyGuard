  "purpose": "Utility functions for datetime formatting, timezone handling, and database connection management in a Django environment, primarily to improve robustness and consistency in scheduled tasks.",
  "sources": "Functions reading configuration settings, timezone-aware datetime objects, and database connection states.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; functions manipulate internal state or configuration, with no data exfiltration or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Datetime objects flow through formatting and timezone conversion functions; database connection handling functions wrap database operations to ensure connection stability.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code follows standard Django and Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for date/time formatting and decorators to handle database connection errors. It uses standard Django modules and best practices for connection management. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external network calls are present. The database retry logic is a common robustness pattern, not indicative of malicious intent. The functions do not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and aligns with typical application utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for managing datetime formatting and database connection robustness in a Django environment. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain attack are present. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
