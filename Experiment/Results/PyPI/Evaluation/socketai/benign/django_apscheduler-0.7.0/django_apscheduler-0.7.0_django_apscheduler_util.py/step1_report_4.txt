  "purpose": "Utility functions and decorators for handling datetime formatting, timezone conversions, and robust database connection management in Django with APScheduler integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for logging, datetime, functools, APScheduler, and Django modules; functions accessing Django settings and database connection management.",
  "sinks": "None evident; functions primarily handle formatting, timezone, and database connection management without writing or executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data such as datetimes flow into formatting and timezone functions; database operation flows through decorated functions that manage connections, especially in error handling scenarios.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Decorators properly handle database errors and connection closing, standard for Django/APSscheduler integrations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for datetime formatting and timezone adjustments based on Django settings. It includes decorators to handle database operational errors and connection management, which are common best practices. The code does not process or handle untrusted user input directly, nor does it include any network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The use of try-except blocks, connection management, and formatting functions are all standard, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for managing datetimes and database connections in a Django project with APScheduler. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The code maintains standard practices for error handling and connection management without any suspicious activity.",
