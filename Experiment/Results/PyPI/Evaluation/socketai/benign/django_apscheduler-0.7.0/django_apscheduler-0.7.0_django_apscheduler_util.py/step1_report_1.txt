    "import statements importing logging, datetime, functools, APScheduler, and Django modules",

  "flows": [
    "Datetime functions receive datetime objects and settings, perform timezone-aware conversions, and format output",
    "Decorators wrap functions to close and reopen database connections upon OperationalError or InterfaceError",
    "Database connection management functions modify Django's connection state"
  ],
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of standard Django and APScheduler modules, with no obfuscated or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for date/time formatting and timezone handling, with decorators to ensure database connection robustness. No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The database error handling decorators are common practices in Django to maintain connection health and do not pose security risks by themselves. No external network calls or data exfiltration activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of utility functions and decorators for managing date/time and database connections within a Django project. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security threats. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code seems safe.",
