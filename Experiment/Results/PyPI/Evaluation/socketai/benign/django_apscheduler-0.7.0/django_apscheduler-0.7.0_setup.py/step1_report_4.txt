  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'django-apscheduler' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies; calling setup() function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the setup() function executes package installation routines, but no untrusted data or external commands are executed within this code.",
  "flows": "The code reads a local file (README.md) and supplies data to the setup() function, which is a standard packaging process; no external data flows or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a local README file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The process is standard and safe. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely.",
