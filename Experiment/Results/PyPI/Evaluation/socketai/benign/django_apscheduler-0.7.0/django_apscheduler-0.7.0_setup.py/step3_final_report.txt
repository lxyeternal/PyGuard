  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file, static metadata definitions, dependency declarations",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local README file and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input. All data is hardcoded or read from local files, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It does not perform any suspicious operations, and the code structure is straightforward. The assigned scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
