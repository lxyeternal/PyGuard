  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for the 'django-apscheduler' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration parameters are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code strictly follows standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a local README file for long description, and invokes setup() with metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python package configuration. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or untrusted input processing observed. The code is static and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
