  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the 'django-apscheduler' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package info, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> Setup configuration; no untrusted data processing or external calls based on untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading a local README.md file for long description, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no use of untrusted inputs in a dangerous manner. The author emails and URL are hardcoded but benign in this context. All code is static and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
