{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for the 'django-apscheduler' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; retrieving package data using find_packages; setting package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> assign to long_description -> pass to setup() parameters; static package configuration without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code; no use of exec, eval, or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and os modules, reads a static README.md file for description, and calls setup() with predefined, hardcoded metadata and dependencies. The data sources are local files and hardcoded strings; the setup process is straightforward and typical for Python packages. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. All dependencies are standard, and no external input influences the setup process. The code appears benign, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
