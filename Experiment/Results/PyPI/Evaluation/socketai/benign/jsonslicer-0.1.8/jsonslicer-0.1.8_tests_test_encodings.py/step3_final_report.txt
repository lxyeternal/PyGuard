  "purpose": "Unit tests for the run_js function processing JSON data with various encodings and options.",
  "sources": "Controlled input data within test cases, no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into run_js, with outputs compared via assertions; no external sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes or strings) into run_js, output is validated against expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of standard unit tests with controlled inputs and expected outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or insecure data handling. The implementation of run_js is not provided, but based on usage, it appears to parse JSON and extract specified fields without malicious intent. The tests are straightforward and do not involve external or untrusted data sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for JSON processing, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the security risk score at 0.0.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
