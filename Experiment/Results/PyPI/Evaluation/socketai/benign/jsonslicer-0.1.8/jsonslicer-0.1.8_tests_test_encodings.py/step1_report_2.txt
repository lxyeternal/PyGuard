{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for a function run_js that processes JSON data with various encoding and binary options",
  "sources": "Input data passed directly as byte strings or Unicode strings to run_js function",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows identified; the code only calls run_js with controlled inputs",
  "flows": "Input data flows directly into run_js; no untrusted data processing or external data flows observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed; standard unittest structure",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of unittests that verify the behavior of run_js with different encodings and binary flags. All inputs are hardcoded test data, and run_js is assumed to process this data. No external data, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious logic are present. The structure is straightforward, with clear assertions, and no code injection or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of unit tests for the run_js function, involving controlled test data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. The code is safe and solely for testing purposes.",
