  "purpose": "Unit tests for the run_js function processing static JSON data with different path_mode parameters.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded JSON string within the test code.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows or sinks; only calls to run_js with static data.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data flows into run_js; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python unittest module testing a function run_js with static JSON input. The JSON is hardcoded, and no external network, file, or environment interactions are present. The function run_js is imported from an external module, but its implementation is unknown. The tests verify expected output structures based on different path_mode settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks within this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The external dependency run_js could be malicious, but based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
