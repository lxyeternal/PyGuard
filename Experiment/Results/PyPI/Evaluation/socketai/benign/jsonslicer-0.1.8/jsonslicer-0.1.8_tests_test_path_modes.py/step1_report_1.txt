{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for a function 'run_js' with various path modes on a JSON object",
  "sources": "Input JSON string and the 'run_js' function imported from '.common'",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data flow to untrusted sources or external systems",
  "flows": "Input JSON is processed by 'run_js' with different 'path_mode' parameters; no external data or untrusted data flows to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; code appears to be standard unit test code",
  "analysis": "The script imports a test framework and a function 'run_js', then defines a JSON data string. It includes three unit tests that call 'run_js' with different 'path_mode' options and check for expected outputs. The code only performs local data processing and testing without external communication or side effects. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The purpose is clearly to test functionality, not to perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit test code for JSON processing with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted data beyond local testing, and there are no suspicious or anomalous patterns.",
