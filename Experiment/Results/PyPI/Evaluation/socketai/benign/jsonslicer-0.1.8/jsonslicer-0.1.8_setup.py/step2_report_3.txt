  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to evaluate the presence of issues, the accuracy of the scoring, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with C++ extensions. It uses subprocess to call 'pkg-config', reads README.md, and configures the build. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code observed.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs typical setup tasks with proper error handling for dependencies. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a typical setup script. It notes that subprocess calls to 'pkg-config' are standard but could be misused if environment is compromised. It assigns a small securityRisk=0.1, which is reasonable given the subprocess usage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n\n- **Assessment:** The cautious note about subprocess calls is appropriate. The overall conclusion that there's no malicious activity is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It handles dependencies and file reading properly.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The minor securityRisk score reflects the subprocess usage but is not indicative of actual malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis, emphasizing that the script is a standard build configuration with no malicious patterns. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score, but still justified given the subprocess calls, though they are standard.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no data leaks, no network activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; scores are 0.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) based on subprocess usage, which is reasonable. These are low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n- **Confidence:** All are high (1), justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to subprocess calls, but standard for build scripts)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package with C++ extensions. No security risks or malicious activity are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No modifications to scores are necessary.  \n- The overall security assessment is that this code is benign and standard for its purpose.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.1** (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given subprocess usage)",
