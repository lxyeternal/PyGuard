  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the 'jsonslicer' Python package with C++ extensions and dependencies.",
  "sources": "subprocess.check_output() call to invoke 'pkg-config' for library configuration; open() to read 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "subprocess output used to configure build; open() reading a local file; print() for error messages.",
  "flows": "subprocess.check_output() reads configuration data from 'pkg-config' -> pkgconfig() processes data -> setup() uses this configuration for extension build; open() reads README.md for long description.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; error handling for missing dependencies appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures: determining paths, retrieving package configuration via 'pkg-config', and configuring a C++ extension module for Python. It includes error handling for missing dependencies, printing messages and exiting as needed. The use of subprocess for external commands is typical for build scripts. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is primarily a build configuration script with standard practices and no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical build setup for a Python package with C++ extensions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No anomalies or malware indicators are detected.",
