{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to validate the behavior of a JavaScript testing function run_js with various configuration flags.",
  "sources": "The code imports the run_js function from a local module (.common). It reads no external data or input streams directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations, nor are there external data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observed; the tests simply call run_js with specific parameters and check exceptions or return values.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard testing operations; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python unittest suite that tests various configurations of a JavaScript parsing function run_js. It raises exceptions or returns values based on the input flags. The structure and content are typical of test scripts, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious code injection. No external data is read in an insecure manner, nor is there any suspicious or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a JavaScript parsing utility. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for testing purposes only.",
