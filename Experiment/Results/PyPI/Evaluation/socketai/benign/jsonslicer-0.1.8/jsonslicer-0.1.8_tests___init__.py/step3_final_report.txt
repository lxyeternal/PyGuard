    "malware": 0.5,
    "obfuscated": 0.6,
    "securityRisk": 0.7,
    "reasoning": "Based on the comprehensive review of all reports, Report 1's analysis correctly identifies dynamic code execution and obfuscation as significant indicators of potential malicious behavior. The original malware score of 0.4 is justified but can be slightly increased to 0.5 to better reflect the severity of eval/exec usage and obfuscation. The obfuscation score remains at 0.6, consistent with the presence of obfuscated variable names and dynamic features. The risk score is elevated to 0.7 to emphasize the potential danger posed by dynamic code execution and obfuscation, aligning with the overall assessment that these features significantly increase the threat level. The other reports indicate benign or insufficient code, with low scores, which remain appropriate. Overall, these adjustments provide a more accurate reflection of the potential malicious intent and security risk associated with the code."
