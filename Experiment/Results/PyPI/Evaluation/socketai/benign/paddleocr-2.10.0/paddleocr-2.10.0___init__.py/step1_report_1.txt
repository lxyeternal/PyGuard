{
  "purpose": "This code defines an import interface for the PaddleOCR library and sets its version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules and the importlib.metadata package to retrieve version info.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is written to external systems, network, or files directly within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly handles module imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The version retrieval is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from internal modules, sets the __version__ variable using importlib.metadata, and defines __all__ for exports. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are involved. The version retrieval is typical and uses standard library methods. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization file for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles imports and version info, with no harmful behavior detected.",
