{
  "purpose": "The code primarily imports modules and functions related to OCR and document processing, setting up package exports and versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'importlib.metadata' and the relative import from '.paddleocr' for various functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; no external network calls or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly initializes imports and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The version detection with fallback is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several functions and classes from a local module and sets the package version using importlib.metadata. It includes a try-except block to handle cases where the package version cannot be retrieved. The '__all__' list exports the main functionalities. No external network activity, data collection, or malicious code is present. The code appears standard for setting up a Python package's __init__.py file, focusing on clean imports and versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as package initialization. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks.",
