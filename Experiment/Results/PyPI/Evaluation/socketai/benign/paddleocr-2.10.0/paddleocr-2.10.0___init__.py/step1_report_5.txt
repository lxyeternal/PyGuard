{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and exports components of a PaddleOCR package, including version detection and public API definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (.paddleocr and importlib.metadata), version retrieval via importlib_metadata.version()",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external output, no I/O or network calls are present",
  "flows": "Importing modules, attempting to retrieve package version, defining exported symbols",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated logic, no unusual behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions and classes from a local module and tries to set a version string using importlib.metadata. It handles a possible PackageNotFoundError exception gracefully. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
