{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package for OCR and document processing, exposing various functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and classes from a local module (.paddleocr) and retrieves package version metadata using importlib.metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; no network, file system, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly performs imports and version assignment without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. Use of importlib.metadata is standard for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up module exports and attempts to retrieve its version. It uses standard import statements and exception handling for missing package info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. It appears to be a benign package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly manages imports and versioning. No security concerns are identified.",
