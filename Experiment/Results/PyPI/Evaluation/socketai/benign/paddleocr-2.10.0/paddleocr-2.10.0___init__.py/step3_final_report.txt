  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing specific modules and functions, setting the package version, and defining the public API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules and functions, version retrieval via importlib.metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Imports and version assignment are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package initialization code with proper exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package, importing modules, setting version info safely, and defining __all__. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The version retrieval is standard practice, and the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals and reports correctly identify it as a standard, safe package initialization script.",
