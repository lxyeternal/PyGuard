{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and exports components related to OCR and document processing functionalities, with a version retrieval mechanism.",
  "sources": "Import statement for '.paddleocr' module, importlib.metadata.version call to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the version info retrieval is a benign operation, and the module exports are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The version retrieval is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports, version handling, and exports. It imports specific functions/classes from a local module, attempts to dynamically retrieve package version info, and defines the public API via __all__. No input handling, no external data processing, and no potentially malicious constructs are present. The version retrieval uses a common pattern and does not involve untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a typical module initialization script with no suspicious activity.",
