  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" — no specific issues reported.\n- **Analysis:** The report states that the code is well-structured, dynamically loads modules, manages model URLs, downloads models, processes images, and performs OCR/structure analysis. It notes no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The reviewer considers the code legitimate, with a high confidence (0.9), and assigns malware and obfuscated scores of 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.  \n- The logic aligns with the code's nature as an OCR/document analysis library.  \n- The scores seem reasonable.  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" — no specific issues.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard model management, image processing, dynamic module loading, and network downloads from public URLs. No suspicious activity or backdoors are observed.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with high confidence (0.9), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, and low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The reasoning is consistent and thorough.  \n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Reports 3 and 4:**\n\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" — no details provided.\n- **Assessment:** Without additional details, no specific issues can be identified or challenged.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Justification:**\n\n- The code is a complex but standard implementation of an OCR/document analysis library.\n- It dynamically loads modules, manages models via URLs, downloads models, processes images, and provides CLI tools.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code segments are evident.\n- The use of environment variables and network downloads from trusted URLs is typical for such tools.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, primarily due to network downloads and dynamic module loading, which are standard but should be monitored.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is legitimate, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Maintain current scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. The code appears safe and aligns with typical OCR library practices.",
