{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for image inference using a PaddlePaddle OCR model, processing images, and saving results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified paths, loads model weights, and reads image data from disk.",
  "sinks": "Writes inference results and images to disk, logs information, and converts image data into tensors for model input.",
  "flows": "Reads image files -> loads and preprocesses image data -> performs model inference -> processes output -> logs and saves results and images.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed. The code relies on standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code follows a typical OCR inference pipeline with proper input handling, model loading, and output processing. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. It does perform file operations, but these are standard for inference workflows. Environment variables are set for resource allocation but do not pose a security risk. No use of dangerous functions or obfuscated code. Overall, the structure and content appear legitimate and typical for this type of application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard OCR inference script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely loads models, processes images, and saves results without evident security risks.",
