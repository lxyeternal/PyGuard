{
  "purpose": "The script performs image inference using a PaddlePaddle OCR model, including loading a model, processing images, running predictions, and saving visual results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from a specified directory, loads model files, reads images in binary mode, and reads configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Writes inference results to a text file, saves annotated images to a directory, and logs information.",
  "flows": "Image files are read as binary data (source) and processed through the model pipeline; results are serialized (json.dumps) and saved to disk; images are annotated and saved locally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of unsafe eval or dynamic code execution. Environment variables are set but benign. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a PaddlePaddle OCR model, processes images for inference, and saves results, including drawing rectangles or boxes on images. It uses standard libraries and practices without suspicious or malicious constructs. Data flows from file reads to model inference to result storage are straightforward. No network communication, credential handling, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be part of an OCR inference pipeline with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OCR inference script that performs image processing and result visualization. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is safe based on this analysis.",
