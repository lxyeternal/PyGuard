  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard OCR inference script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score can be conservatively set at 0.1. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9)."
