{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for performing OCR inference using PaddlePaddle, processing images, and saving results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files, environment variables, and model configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Writes inference results to a text file, saves processed images, logs information, and loads models.",
  "flows": "Reads image files -> loads images into memory -> performs model inference -> processes output -> writes results to files and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; environment variable setting appears benign; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads images, runs a pre-trained OCR model, processes the output, and saves results. It uses standard libraries and third-party PaddlePaddle modules. No data exfiltration, suspicious network activity, or malicious behavior observed. The code handles images and logs info securely. No obfuscated code or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OCR inference script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard processing tasks with typical use of libraries and environment settings. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.",
