{
  "purpose": "Standard OCR inference pipeline using PaddlePaddle, loading models, processing images, and logging results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk using get_image_file_list, opens files in binary mode ('rb'), reads image data.",
  "sinks": "Model inference via paddle.to_tensor, logging inference results.",
  "flows": "Image file paths -> open(file, 'rb') -> read() -> transform() -> model inference -> post-process -> log results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical OCR inference steps with standard libraries and data handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity observed. Environment variable setting is standard resource management. Data flows are straightforward, with no suspicious data leaks or external communications. The code's structure and operations align with legitimate OCR pipelines, and the security signals are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate OCR inference script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security and malware scores are appropriately set to zero, and the risk score is very low. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
