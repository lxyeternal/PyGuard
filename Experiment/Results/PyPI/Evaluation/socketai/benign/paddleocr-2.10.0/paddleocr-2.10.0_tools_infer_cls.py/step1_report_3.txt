{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) pipeline used for inference on images, involving data loading, model building, and post-processing.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from image files via open() in binary mode; environment variables are set with os.environ; external libraries such as paddle and custom modules are imported.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flow from image files read into memory, passed to model, and output via logger.info calls.",
  "flows": "Image files are read in binary, loaded into memory, transformed, converted to tensor, passed to model for inference, then post-processed and logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is present. Environment variable setting is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard inference steps for an OCR model: setting environment variables, importing modules, defining a main function, building the model and post-processing pipeline, reading image files, transforming them, running inference, and logging results. All operations are typical for a machine learning inference pipeline. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification, is observed. Third-party library usage is appropriate. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical OCR inference script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads. Its security risk score is low, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
