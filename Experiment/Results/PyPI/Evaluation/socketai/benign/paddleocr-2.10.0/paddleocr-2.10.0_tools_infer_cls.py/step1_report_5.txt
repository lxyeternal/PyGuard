{
  "purpose": "This script is designed for performing image inference using a OCR model built with PaddlePaddle, including loading models, processing images, and outputting results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk via get_image_file_list and open(), reads environment variables, and imports multiple modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "Reads image data from files, processes data through model inference, logs results via logger.info().",
  "flows": "Image files are read and loaded into memory, transformed, fed into the model, and the predictions are post-processed and logged.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; environment variables are set in a typical manner; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image processing and model inference tasks using PaddlePaddle. It reads image files, processes them through defined transformations, and outputs results. It imports necessary modules and functions, sets an environment variable for memory allocation strategy, and follows a typical ML inference pipeline. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The code adheres to expected practices for a model inference script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image inference pipeline with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a standard implementation for running OCR model inference on images.",
