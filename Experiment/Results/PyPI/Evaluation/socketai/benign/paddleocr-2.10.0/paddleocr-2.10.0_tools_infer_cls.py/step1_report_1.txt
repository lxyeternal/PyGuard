{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for image inference using the PaddlePaddle framework, including model loading, data preprocessing, and post-processing for OCR tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk (get_image_file_list), reads image data in binary mode (open(file, 'rb'))",
  "sinks": "Reads image data from disk, uses paddle.to_tensor to process images, logs inference results with logger.info",
  "flows": "Image file paths are obtained from get_image_file_list, image data is read from files and converted into tensors for model inference, results are processed and logged",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures or dynamic code execution; standard data loading and processing pipeline. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical machine learning inference tasks: it loads a configuration, builds models and post-processing, reads images, transforms data, performs inference, and logs results. All operations are consistent with standard practices. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious logic detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. Environment variables and imports are standard. External dependencies are common ML libraries and project modules, not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard image inference script for OCR with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as expected for a model deployment pipeline, with no anomalous or malicious code detected.",
