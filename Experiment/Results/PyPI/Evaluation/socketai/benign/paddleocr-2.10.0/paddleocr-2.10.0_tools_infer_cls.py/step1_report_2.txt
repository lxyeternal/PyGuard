{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to perform OCR inference using a PaddlePaddle-based model, processing images to generate text recognition results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk via get_image_file_list and open() functions; reads image data in binary mode.",
  "sinks": "Reads image data into memory; processes data through the model; logs results via logger.info.",
  "flows": "Image files are listed, opened in binary mode, and read into memory; image data is transformed into tensors; inference results are processed and logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Environment variable is set to 'auto_growth' for memory management, which is typical. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical OCR inference steps: loading configuration, building models and post-processing, reading image files, converting images into tensors, and performing inference. Use of standard libraries and functions appears legitimate. No signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The use of environment variable setting 'FLAGS_allocator_strategy' is standard for resource management. All data flows are typical for image processing pipelines. The code structure and variable naming are straightforward and consistent with OCR inference tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard OCR inference pipeline with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It reads images, processes them through a machine learning model, and logs results. No signs of malware or security risks were identified.",
