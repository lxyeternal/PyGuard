{
  "purpose": "This code performs image inference using a PaddlePaddle OCR model pipeline, including model loading, data transformation, inference, and post-processing.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk (get_image_file_list, open), reads environment variables (os.environ), and loads model weights (load_model).",
  "sinks": "Reads image data from files and processes it through the model; outputs inference results via logger.info.",
  "flows": "Image files are read from disk, data is transformed and fed into the model, predictions are generated, then results are logged.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of environment variables, model loading, and data processing. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes environment variables and imports necessary modules, constructs a model, loads pretrained weights, creates data transformations, and performs inference on images. The process appears to follow a typical OCR inference pipeline. The code does not include any network communications, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. It operates locally with standard libraries and functions. No anomalous or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical OCR inference script with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs expected tasks such as loading models, transforming data, and printing results.",
