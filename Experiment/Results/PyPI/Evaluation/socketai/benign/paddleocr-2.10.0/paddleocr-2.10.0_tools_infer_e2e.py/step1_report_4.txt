  "purpose": "The script appears to be for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) processing, including image loading, text detection, and visualization of results.",
  "sources": "File reading from image paths, environment variables, and model loading functions.",
  "sinks": "Image writing to disk, displaying logs, and model inference outputs.",
  "flows": "Input image files -> preprocessing -> model inference -> postprocessing -> visualization and saving results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. Usage of random seed in visualization may be unnecessary but not malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical OCR tasks with image processing, model inference, and visualization. It imports necessary libraries securely, uses environment variables appropriately, and does not include code for data exfiltration or malicious system access. No hardcoded secrets, network communications to suspicious domains, or backdoors are present. The usage of random seed in visualization is benign and likely for consistent output. Overall, the structure is standard for OCR pipelines, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OCR processing pipeline with visualization; no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
