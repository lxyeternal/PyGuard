{
  "purpose": "The code performs OCR inference, visualizes detected text and bounding boxes, and saves annotated images and JSON results locally.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk, environment variables, font files, and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Saves images and JSON files to disk, logs information.",
  "flows": "Loads images -> model inference -> post-processing -> visualization -> saving results.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded font path and sets environment variables; fixed random seed for visualization consistency, but these are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard OCR visualization pipeline with no network activity, no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It relies on common libraries and practices, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The flow is straightforward, and the code’s purpose is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is a benign OCR visualization script with standard operations and no signs of sabotage.",
