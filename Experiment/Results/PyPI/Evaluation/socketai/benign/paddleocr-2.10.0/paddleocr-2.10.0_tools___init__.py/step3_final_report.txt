  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments with no executable code, data processing, or suspicious constructs. No data inputs, outputs, or data flows are present. The comments are standard licensing headers referencing various organizations. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign licensing headers with no malicious or security concerns. All scores are consistent with the content, and no further action is necessary.",
