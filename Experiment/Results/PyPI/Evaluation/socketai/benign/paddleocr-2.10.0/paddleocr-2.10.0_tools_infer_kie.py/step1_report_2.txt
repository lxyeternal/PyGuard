{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a part of an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and KIE (Key Information Extraction) system, involving model loading, data processing, inference, visualization, and result output.",
  "sources": "File input from specified image list, configuration files, and class list; environment variable 'FLAGS_allocator_strategy'.",
  "sinks": "Writing images to disk, writing JSON results to output files.",
  "flows": "Data read from files → processed with model inference → visualization and result saving.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behaviors observed. Use of environment variables and file I/O are typical for such applications.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs image data loading, model inference, visualization, and output. It uses standard libraries (numpy, cv2, paddle) and custom modules for model building and data transformation. File operations are straightforward, writing images and JSON results. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network connections, and no hidden backdoors are detected. The environment variable 'FLAGS_allocator_strategy' is standard for PaddlePaddle. The code does not contain any obfuscated patterns or unusual language features. All data flows are consistent with legitimate OCR/KIE workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical OCR/KIE inference pipeline with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It reads data from local files, performs model inference, visualizes results, and writes outputs. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within the code scope.",
