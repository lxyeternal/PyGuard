{
  "purpose": "This code performs OCR/KIE inference, reading images, applying transformations, running a PaddlePaddle model, visualizing results, and saving output images and annotations.",
  "sources": "Reads image files, class list file, and inference image data; accesses environment variables; reads model and data files.",
  "sinks": "Writes visualization images to disk, writes JSON results to output file.",
  "flows": "Input image data and class list -> model inference -> visualization and result output -> saved images and JSON annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard OCR/KIE inference pipeline utilizing common libraries and practices. It reads images, applies transformations, runs a model, visualizes results, and writes outputs. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or malicious code are present. Environment variables and file operations are typical. The code's structure and functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate OCR/KIE inference script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
