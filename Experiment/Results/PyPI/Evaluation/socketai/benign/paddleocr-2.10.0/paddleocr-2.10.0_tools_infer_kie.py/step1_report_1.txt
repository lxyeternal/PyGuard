{
  "purpose": "This script appears to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Key Information Extraction (KIE) using a PaddlePaddle-based model, processing images and saving results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk, reads class list from a file, reads image data from a binary inference file, and reads configuration and dataset files.",
  "sinks": "Writes output images and JSON result files to disk.",
  "flows": "Loads image data, applies transformations, passes data through a model, processes model outputs, visualizes and saves results.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard open/read/write functions with no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual data handling. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical OCR/KIE inference workflow: reading input data, applying transformations, running a PaddlePaddle model, visualizing predictions, and writing results. It uses common libraries like numpy, cv2, paddle, and standard file operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network connections are present. The code does not include any malicious payloads or obfuscated logic. The only potential concern could be external data or model files, but these are standard for such applications and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OCR/KIE inference script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate part of an OCR/KIE pipeline without security risks based on its content.",
