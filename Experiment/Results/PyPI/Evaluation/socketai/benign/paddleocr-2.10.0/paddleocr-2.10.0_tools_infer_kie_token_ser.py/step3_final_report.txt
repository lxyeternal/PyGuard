{
  "purpose": "The code implements an OCR inference pipeline using PaddlePaddle and PaddleOCR, involving model loading, image reading, inference, post-processing, visualization, and saving results.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk via file paths, loads models, and environment variables are set for GPU memory management.",
  "sinks": "Outputs inference results to text files and saves visualized images; no untrusted data is sent over networks or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Image data is read from disk, transformed into tensors, passed through the model, post-processed, and results are saved and visualized.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. Environment variables and data handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward OCR pipeline with standard library usage, environment variable setting, and file I/O. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The data flow is transparent, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate OCR inference implementation with no security concerns or malicious activity detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1) and zero malware/obfuscation scores are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
