{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) processing with a custom model, post-processing, and visualization, primarily for text extraction and analysis in images.",
  "sources": "Input image files read from disk via 'img_path' in data dictionary, environment variables, and data loaded via open/read functions.",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed images saved to disk, inference results written to a text file, and logs generated by logger.info.",
  "flows": "Image data read from disk -> preprocessed into tensor format -> passed through model for prediction -> post-processed for OCR results -> saved as images and text files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code employs standard library usage, environment variable setting, and external library calls for OCR and image processing.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a machine learning model for OCR, reads image files, transforms and processes data through the model, and saves results to disk. Environment variables and external libraries are used in typical ways. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors are present. The only noteworthy point is standard usage of environment variables and file I/O, which are common in such applications. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard implementation for an OCR pipeline with post-processing and visualization. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
