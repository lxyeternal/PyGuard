  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call from setuptools, which may read package metadata and configuration from other files or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data outputs or external connections.",
  "flows": "The setup() function may internally process configuration data, but no explicit source-to-sink flows are present in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal setup script that imports setuptools and calls setup(). It does not contain any malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code relies on external configuration for package details, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
