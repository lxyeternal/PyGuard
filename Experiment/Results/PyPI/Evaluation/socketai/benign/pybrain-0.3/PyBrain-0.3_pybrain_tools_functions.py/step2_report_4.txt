  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code quality issues, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a collection of mathematical functions for neural networks and probability distributions. No external data sources, malicious code, or suspicious operations are detected. The only notable issue is the use of deprecated `cmp` functions, which could cause compatibility issues but not security risks.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent with no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code appears clear.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to compatibility concerns, not security.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The report is accurate. No malware or malicious behavior is evident. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on mathematical functions, no external data handling, network activity, or backdoors. The only anomaly is the deprecated `cmp` usage, which is a code compatibility issue, not a security concern.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security issues.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The analysis is correct. The low risk score is justified. The deprecated `cmp` does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard mathematical functions for neural networks and probabilistic modeling. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or external communication. Use of `rand()` is typical for sampling, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — still low, possibly due to the use of random functions but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The report is accurate. The risk score remains low, reflecting benign usage.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with standard functions and no signs of malicious intent. Use of `rand()` for sampling is common. No external I/O or network activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code clarity maintained.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — acceptable, given the probabilistic functions.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The analysis is correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a mathematical utility library with no malicious or sabotage behavior. No network, external data, or backdoors. The use of `rand()` is standard.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security concerns.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code is a standard mathematical utility library with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The scores are very low (0 to 0.2). Given the nature of the code—pure mathematical functions with no external I/O, network activity, or suspicious constructs—these are reasonable. The only minor concern is the deprecated `cmp` usage, which affects compatibility but not security.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 — very low, mainly due to compatibility issues, not security.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the deprecated `cmp` usage and the overall benign nature of the code.\n\nThis code appears to be a safe, standard mathematical utility library with no security risks or malicious intent.",
