  "purpose": "Mathematical utility functions for neural networks, probability distributions, and data transformations, with no external I/O or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data for functions like semilinear, expln, and multivariateNormalPdf; random sampling via rand() in distribution functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points; functions operate internally without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into mathematical functions; random sampling functions generate outputs but do not leak data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'cmp' function in ranking(), which affects compatibility but not security; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard mathematical functions used in neural networks and probabilistic modeling. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of 'rand()' for sampling is typical. The only notable issue is the deprecated 'cmp' function, which causes compatibility problems in Python 3 but is not malicious. The functions include safeguards like 'safeExp' to prevent overflow. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical utility library with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Minor compatibility issues exist but do not impact security. The overall malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score very low (~0.1). It is safe for use in production environments.",
