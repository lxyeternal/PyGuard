  "purpose": "Analyze the security implications of importing all symbols from structure.__init__ in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which executes module-level code in structure.__init__.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, any functions or variables imported that could be used maliciously if the module is compromised.",
  "flows": "Import statement -> execution of structure.__init__ code -> potential use of imported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and hide malicious code; no direct malicious code present in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement: 'from structure.__init__ import *'. This does not directly execute malicious code but can execute module-level code within structure.__init__, which could be malicious if the module is compromised. The use of wildcard import reduces code clarity and can hide malicious or unwanted behavior. Scores assigned in previous reports range from 0 to 0.2 for malware, 0.2 to 0.4 for security risk, and zero for obfuscation, which are appropriate given the limited context. The risk primarily stems from the potential for malicious code within the imported module, not from the import statement itself. Without inspecting structure.__init__, the risk remains speculative but warrants caution. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (around 0.1-0.2), moderate security risk (around 0.3), and no obfuscation (0).",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but introduces a risk of hidden malicious code if the imported module is compromised. The practice of 'import *' obscures the imported symbols, increasing potential security concerns. Further inspection of structure.__init__ is recommended to confirm its safety. Current scores are appropriate, with low malware risk and moderate security concern due to obscurity.",
