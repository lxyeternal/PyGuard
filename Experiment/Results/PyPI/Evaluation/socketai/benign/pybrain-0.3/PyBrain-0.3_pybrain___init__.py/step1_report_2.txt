  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows present in this single line of code",
  "flows": "N/A, only an import statement without execution of data processing",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported entities and potentially hide malicious code or unwanted behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code performs a single import operation using a wildcard from 'structure.__init__'. Such imports can hide imported functions, variables, or modules, making it difficult to determine what is being included. This can potentially be used to hide malicious code or backdoors within the imported module. No other code or data flows are present to analyze. The import alone does not execute code but can introduce malicious or unwanted code into the environment if the imported module is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary risk stems from the use of a wildcard import, which can obscure malicious behavior or unwanted functions within 'structure.__init__'. Without inspecting that module's content, it is difficult to definitively assess malicious intent, but the import style is suspicious and warrants caution.",
