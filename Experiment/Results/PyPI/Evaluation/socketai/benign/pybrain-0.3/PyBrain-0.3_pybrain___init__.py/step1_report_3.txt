  "flows": "Potentially depends on imported content, but no explicit data flow shown here",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure which components are imported; no explicit malicious activity present in this line alone",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports all contents from the module structure.__init__. Using 'import *' can hide which components are brought into the namespace, potentially hiding malicious or unsafe code if the imported module contains such. However, this line alone does not perform any malicious actions. Without inspecting the content of the imported module, no definitive malicious behavior can be concluded. The import statement itself is a common Python pattern but can be risky if the imported module is malicious or contains obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a simple import statement; no direct malicious behavior is evident. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can mask malicious or unwanted imports if the imported module is compromised. Further analysis of 'structure.__init__' is needed to determine if there are any hidden risks.",
