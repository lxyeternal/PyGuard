  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but introduces a risk of hidden malicious code if the imported module is compromised. The practice of 'import *' obscures the imported symbols, increasing potential security concerns. Further inspection of structure.__init__ is recommended to confirm its safety. Current scores are appropriate, with low malware risk and moderate security concern due to obscurity."
