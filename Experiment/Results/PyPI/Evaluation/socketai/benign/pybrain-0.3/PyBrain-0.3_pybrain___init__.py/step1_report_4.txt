  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module structure.__init__",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; the source is the external module 'structure.__init__'",
  "sinks": "Potentially any functions or variables imported from 'structure.__init__' could be used as sinks if they process untrusted data",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (if any) could flow from the imported module into the code that uses these imports, but no such code is provided here",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import statement with no additional context; this is unusual because wildcard imports can hide what is being imported, potentially masking malicious or unintended code",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement, which imports all contents from 'structure.__init__'. Since there is no further code, no data flows, or processing shown, the analysis is limited. The use of a wildcard import can obscure what is being imported, possibly hiding malicious or unintended behavior within the imported module. Without more context or usage, it is impossible to determine if this import introduces security risks, but the minimal code does not directly exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious behavior. However, the use of a wildcard import can conceal hidden malicious or unwanted code in 'structure.__init__'. Without additional context or code execution, no direct malicious activity is evident.",
