{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting sequential datasets into fixed-size windows for supervised learning, evaluating window-based classification results, and normalizing datasets using stored parameters.",
  "sources": "Data is read from SequentialDataSet objects ('input', 'target', 'sequence_index', 'endmarker'), files for normalization parameters ('load' method), and dataset attributes for normalization.",
  "sinks": "The code writes normalization parameters to files ('save' method), outputs print statements with dataset and window statistics, and processes dataset samples internally without external untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from dataset attributes, processed into windows or normalized, then optionally saved to files or output via print statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses Python 2 syntax ('xrange', 'file' constructor, print statements without parentheses), which may indicate outdated or obfuscated code but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. No obfuscated code patterns or hidden behaviors are present. The comments and structure suggest standard dataset processing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on dataset manipulation: converting sequences into windows, evaluating classification results, and normalizing data with optional file-based parameters. It employs standard Python data handling and numpy operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The usage of outdated Python 2 syntax might obscure the code but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall functionality appears benign and typical for machine learning data preprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard data processing code for sequential datasets with normalization capabilities. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The use of Python 2 syntax suggests it might be outdated but not malicious. Overall security risk is minimal, with no signs of compromise or sabotage.",
