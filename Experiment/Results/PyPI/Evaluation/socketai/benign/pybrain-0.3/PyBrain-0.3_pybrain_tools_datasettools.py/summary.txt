  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for sequential data preprocessing and evaluation, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware score (0), minimal obfuscation (0.1 due to outdated syntax), and low risk score (0.2) are justified. No modifications are necessary."
