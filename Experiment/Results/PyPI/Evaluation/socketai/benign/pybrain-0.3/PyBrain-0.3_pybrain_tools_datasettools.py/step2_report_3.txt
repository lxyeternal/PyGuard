  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard dataset conversion, evaluation, and normalization routines.\n- **Sinks:** Data added via `addSample`, files read/written for normalization — typical for data processing.\n- **Flows:** Clear data flow; no external network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The print statements are benign debugging outputs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, legitimate, and performs common ML preprocessing tasks. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; dataset conversion and normalization.\n- **Sinks:** Writes normalization parameters; no external network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Commented assertions and print statements are benign; reliance on normalization files is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious or malicious patterns; standard data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for dataset processing.\n- **Sinks:** File I/O, dataset modifications; no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of deprecated `file()` and `xrange` (Python 2) indicates outdated code, but not malicious. No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard dataset routines, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; scores justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Dataset windowing, normalization, evaluation.\n- **Sinks:** File operations, print statements; no external network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of Python 2 syntax; potential for outdated code but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine data processing code; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.1, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar dataset processing routines.\n- **Sinks:** Dataset modifications, normalization files; no network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of Python 2 syntax, but no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard data preprocessing; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns; scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Mostly 0, with a minor mention of outdated syntax (Python 2), which isn't malicious but could be considered slightly obfuscated or legacy. A score of 0.1 is acceptable.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low at 0.2, reflecting standard data processing routines with minimal security concerns.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.1 — minor legacy syntax, not malicious.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — standard data processing; no evident vulnerabilities or supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is legitimate, standard ML preprocessing code with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
