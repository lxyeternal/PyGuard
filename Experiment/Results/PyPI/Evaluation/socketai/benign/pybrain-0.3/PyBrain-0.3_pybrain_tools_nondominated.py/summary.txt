  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of multi-objective optimization routines with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight security risk score of 0.1 reflects the use of legacy syntax but does not indicate a security concern."
