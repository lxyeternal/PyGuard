{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for multi-objective optimization, including calculating crowding distances, non-dominated sorting, and related operations used in evolutionary algorithms.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'individuals', 'fitnesses', and 'iterable'. It also uses internal variables and temporary data structures for calculations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks like network transmission, file writes, or system calls. It mainly processes data in memory and returns data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data (individuals, fitnesses) are processed through sorting, normalization, and dominance checks to produce front sets and distance metrics. No untrusted external data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution. The code uses deprecated 'xrange' which may indicate legacy style but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs multi-objective evolutionary algorithm operations such as crowding distance calculation and non-dominated sorting. It relies on standard libraries, no network or system calls are present. No anomalies like backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious control flow are detected. The algorithms follow conventional approaches for Pareto front calculations. Usage of 'xrange' indicates Python 2 code, but this is not suspicious per se. The code seems legitimate and focused on optimization computations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate implementation of multi-objective optimization routines without any signs of malicious behavior. It processes data in memory and does not contain any suspicious or harmful code patterns.",
