  "purpose": "Implementation of multi-objective optimization routines including crowding distance calculation, non-dominated sorting, and Pareto front identification.",
  "sources": "Input data structures such as 'individuals' and 'fitnesses', which are processed within functions; no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None present; no external communication, file I/O, or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through sorting, dominance checks, and distance calculations within functions; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'xrange' indicates legacy Python 2 code; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard multi-objective optimization algorithms, including crowding distance and non-dominated sorting. It operates solely on provided data structures, with no external interactions or malicious code. The functions are straightforward, match known algorithms, and contain no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of 'xrange' is a legacy syntax but not malicious. No external sinks or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs legitimate computational tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of multi-objective optimization routines with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight security risk score of 0.1 reflects the use of legacy syntax but does not indicate a security concern.",
