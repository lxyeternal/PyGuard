{
  "purpose": "The code implements multi-objective optimization algorithms, specifically non-dominated sorting and crowding distance calculations, likely for use in evolutionary algorithms or genetic algorithms.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters such as 'individuals' and 'fitnesses', and internally processes collections and arrays.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks such as network communications, file writing, or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Input data (individuals, fitnesses) flows into sorting and filtering functions; no external data sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'xrange', indicating Python 2; no evident hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The code appears standard for multi-objective optimization. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script contains functions for calculating crowding distances and identifying non-dominated fronts, which are typical in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. It uses standard Python features, collections, and numpy/scipy for array operations. No network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious code snippets are present. The use of 'xrange' and reliance on numpy/scipy are consistent with common scientific Python code. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior identified. The functions perform computations solely on input data to produce sorted frontiers or distance measures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of multi-objective optimization routines, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. It is safe for use, assuming the algorithms are intended for optimization purposes.",
