  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for experiment management. The primary security concern is pickle deserialization, which can be exploited if untrusted files are loaded. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The low malware score (0) and low to moderate security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality."
