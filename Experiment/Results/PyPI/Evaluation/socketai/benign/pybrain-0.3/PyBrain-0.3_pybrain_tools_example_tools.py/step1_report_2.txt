  "purpose": "This class provides reinforcement learning tools for printing, saving, and loading neural network weights and results, primarily used for RL experiments.",
  "sources": "File reading in loadWeights (load), file writing in saveWeights and saveResults, and console output in printResults.",
  "sinks": "File operations that could potentially overwrite or read sensitive files, and print statements that output evaluation metrics.",
  "flows": "loadWeights reads from filename, load data into agent; saveWeights/saveResults write data to filename; printResults outputs metrics to console; showExps displays plots.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard scientific libraries and file operations are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code manages reinforcement learning experiments by saving/loading weights and results, printing statistics, and plotting results. File operations are standard, with no evident malicious code. The code's use of cPickle and file handling could pose security issues if untrusted files are loaded, but these are common in experimental scripts. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code appears benign, focusing solely on experiment management.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical reinforcement learning utility class with standard file handling, data processing, and plotting. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The only potential security concern relates to loading untrusted pickle files, which is a common risk in scientific scripts but not inherently malicious.",
