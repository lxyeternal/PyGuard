  "purpose": "Utility class for reinforcement learning experiments: loading/saving weights and results, printing summaries, and plotting data.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations for loading weights and results, using pickle for serialization/deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization of pickle files which could execute arbitrary code if files are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Loading weights/results from pickle files; printing and plotting data; saving data via pickle.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'file()' function; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard RL experiment management functions. It uses pickle, which is a known security risk if files are untrusted, but no malicious intent or behavior is evident. No signs of backdoors, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is the deserialization of potentially malicious pickle files, but this is typical in scientific scripts and does not imply malicious activity. The code's structure is straightforward, and no anomalies suggest sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for experiment management. The primary security concern is pickle deserialization, which can be exploited if untrusted files are loaded. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The low malware score (0) and low to moderate security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
