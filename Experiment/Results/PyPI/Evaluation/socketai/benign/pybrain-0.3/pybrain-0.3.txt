      "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary security concern is the use of an outdated Python version, which is not malicious but should be flagged for security reasons. The reports and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's characteristics."

      "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but introduces a risk of hidden malicious code if the imported module is compromised. The practice of 'import *' obscures the imported symbols, increasing potential security concerns. Further inspection of structure.__init__ is recommended to confirm its safety. Current scores are appropriate, with low malware risk and moderate security concern due to obscurity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary security consideration is the use of pickle for serialization, which should be handled carefully to avoid loading untrusted data. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious payloads."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slight security risk score of 0.1 reflects the use of legacy syntax but does not indicate a security concern."
