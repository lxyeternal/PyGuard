{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the PyBrain library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata from the script itself, such as package name, version, description, license, keywords, URL, and package inclusion parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from static metadata definitions to the setuptools setup function call; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The script uses a standard setup procedure with no obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup script using setuptools. It defines package metadata and configuration for distribution. No input or data from external or untrusted sources is processed or executed dynamically. There are no signs of malicious code, such as code injection, network activity, or hidden behaviors. The use of Python 2.5 is outdated but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only specifies package metadata for distribution purposes. No malware or security threats are present.",
