  "purpose": "Utility functions for listing files, filtering strings, and serializing/deserializing dictionaries with pickle.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for directory listing; open() for file reading/writing; pickle.load() for deserialization.",
  "sinks": "pickle.load() potentially executing code if loading untrusted data.",
  "flows": "getAllFilesIn() reads directory contents; selectSome() filters strings; pickleReadDict() deserializes data; addToDictFile() reads, modifies, and dumps data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' with mode 'w' instead of 'wb' for pickle dumping, which is a bug but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward utility functions with no network or command execution. The primary security concern is the use of pickle, which can execute arbitrary code during unpickling if data is maliciously crafted. The incorrect file mode ('w' instead of 'wb') is a technical bug. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The risk score varies from 0.2 to 0.6 across reports, justified by pickle's inherent dangers. A conservative overall risk score of around 0.4 is appropriate, reflecting the potential for exploitation if untrusted pickle data is processed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malware or malicious intent. The main security concern is the unsafe use of pickle, which warrants a moderate risk score (~0.4). The technical bug with file modes should be fixed but does not impact malware or obfuscation assessments.",
