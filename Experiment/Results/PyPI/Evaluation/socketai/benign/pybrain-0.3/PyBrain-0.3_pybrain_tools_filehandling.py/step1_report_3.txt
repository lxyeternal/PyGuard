{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for file listing, filtering, and pickling data, specifically for handling pickle files and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() for directory listing, open() for reading/writing files, pickle.load() and pickle.dump() for serialization/deserialization.",
  "sinks": "File writing with open() and pickle.dump(), reading files with open() and pickle.load().",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> filtering filenames -> reading/writing pickle files -> updating dictionaries in files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses text mode ('w') for pickle dump instead of binary mode ('wb'), which can cause incompatibility, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file operations, listing, filtering, and pickling data structures. The pickle usage in text mode is a technical flaw but not malicious. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. Functions are straightforward with no suspicious side effects. The main concern is the insecure pickle file handling mode, which can lead to security issues if untrusted pickle data is loaded, but this does not indicate malicious intent. No malicious behavior or malware detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for handling pickle files and directory listings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The primary technical concern is the incorrect use of file modes in pickle dump functions, but this does not constitute malicious activity.",
