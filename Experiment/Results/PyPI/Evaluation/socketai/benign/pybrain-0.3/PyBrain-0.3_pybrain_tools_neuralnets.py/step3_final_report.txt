{
  "purpose": "The code provides a neural network training, validation, and saving utility using pybrain, designed for classification and regression tasks with visualization support.",
  "sources": "Reads datasets (DS, TDS, VDS), logs progress, and saves models and training curves to files.",
  "sinks": "Writes training curves in CSV format, saves trained network models, and logs information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from datasets into training routines; trained models are saved to disk; training progress is logged and visualized.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Minor outdated syntax ('raise TypeError, ...', 'wb' mode) noted but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard neural network training workflows with dataset handling, training, validation, and model persistence. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The minor syntax issues are outdated style choices, not security concerns. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign neural network utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It operates as expected for such ML tools, with standard file I/O and logging. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
