  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign neural network utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It operates as expected for such ML tools, with standard file I/O and logging. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior."
