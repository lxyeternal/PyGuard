{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for neural network training, validation, and plotting, mainly for regression and classification tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (pylab, csv, numpy, logging, pybrain modules), class initializers, setup and run methods, file saving functions.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations (saveTrainingCurve, saveNetwork), network saving (saveNetwork), logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Data read from datasets during training and validation; data written to CSV files during training curve save; trained models saved to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. Use of 'Infinity' from numpy is benign. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution. Logging is standard, with no suspicious data leaks or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines neural network training and classification classes using the pybrain library, with functionalities for setup, training, validation, plotting, and saving models and training curves. No network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration is evident. File operations are standard for saving models and CSV logs. Use of 'Infinity' is safe. The code’s structure and content are consistent with typical machine learning training scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate neural network training tool with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It performs data training, validation, and logging in a standard manner. There are no indicators of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
