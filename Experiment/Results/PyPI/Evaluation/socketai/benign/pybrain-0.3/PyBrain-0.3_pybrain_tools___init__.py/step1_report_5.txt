{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module or script, but without specific comments or context, its purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables and possibly from input functions or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network, or outputs via print or logging statements.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment variables or inputs may flow into sensitive operations or data transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious code structures, or obfuscated code observed. No unconventional language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward; it reads environment variables and performs standard operations. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized network connections are evident. Absence of suspicious logic, obfuscation, or hidden functionalities. The lack of context makes it difficult to determine full intent, but from the provided snippet, there is no indication of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks.",
