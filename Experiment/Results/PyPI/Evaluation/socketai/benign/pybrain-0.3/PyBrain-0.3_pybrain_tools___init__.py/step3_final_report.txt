  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, standard library functions, and external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system access, environment variable reads, data output streams.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions, with outputs potentially sent over network or stored locally.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, placeholder scripts, or benign code with no suspicious patterns; minimal or no obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or benign nature of code. Zero malware and obfuscation scores are justified given the lack of suspicious patterns. Slight security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are acceptable but could be lowered to zero, as no evidence suggests actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent. Confidence levels are appropriate, with high certainty in benign assessments. No anomalies or malicious flows are detected. The code, when present, appears straightforward and free of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided reports, the code is benign or absent, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects this assessment, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
