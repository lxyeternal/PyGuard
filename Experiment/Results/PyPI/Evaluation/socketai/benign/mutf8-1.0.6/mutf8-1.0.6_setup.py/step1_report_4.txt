  "purpose": "Setup script for the mutf8 Python package, facilitating package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other external inputs detected.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or external communications are initiated.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description, then proceeds with package setup; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. Use of standard setuptools without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading a local README file, defining package metadata, specifying dependencies and optional C extension modules. No user input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns are present. All code appears typical for a setup script, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs routine tasks to prepare a Python package for distribution.",
