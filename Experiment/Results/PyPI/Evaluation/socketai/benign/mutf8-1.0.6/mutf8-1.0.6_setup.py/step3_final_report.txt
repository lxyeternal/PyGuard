  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'mutf8' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and optional C extension.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, package metadata definitions, and specifying an optional C extension source file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks; no network activity or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Reading local README file -> setting package metadata -> optional C extension inclusion; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' for a Python package, performing standard tasks such as reading a local README, defining package info, dependencies, and an optional C extension. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscated logic. The optional extension is benign and for performance. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0, some at 0.1 for conservativeness). The code's structure and content do not suggest malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
