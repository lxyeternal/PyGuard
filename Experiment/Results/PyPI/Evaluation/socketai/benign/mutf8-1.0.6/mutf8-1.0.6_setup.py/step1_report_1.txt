{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'mutf8', intended to facilitate packaging and distribution, including optional C extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and configuration data for package metadata, dependencies, and extensions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks; the script primarily handles static configuration and file reading.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md → used in package metadata; defines extension module → integrated during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The code performs standard setup tasks without malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setup, reads the README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and optional C extension configuration. No external input is processed during runtime, and the code strictly handles package setup. No indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity. It securely handles static configuration and optional C extensions, with no anomalous or suspicious behavior detected.",
