{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'mutf8' that provides fast MUTF-8 encoding and decoding functionality.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, package metadata, and extension source files ('mutf8/cmutf8.c')",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows into insecure or malicious sinks such as network or system commands",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content into 'long_description'; use extension source file in compilation process",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses setuptools to configure package setup. It reads the README.md for long description. It specifies package metadata, including name, version, author info, and classifiers. It defines optional test dependencies. It configures an extension module with a C source file. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The extension is optional and related to performance or encoding, consistent with package purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup configuration script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
