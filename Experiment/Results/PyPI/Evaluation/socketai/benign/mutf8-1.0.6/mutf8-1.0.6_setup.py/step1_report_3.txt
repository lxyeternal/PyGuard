  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'mutf8' Python package, used to configure package installation, dependencies, and extension modules.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description, retrieving package metadata (author, email, URL).",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the setup process involves standard package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content (source) to long_description (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code behaviors. The code uses standard setup functions, and the extension module is optional with no malicious instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, configures package metadata, dependencies, and optional C extension compilation. All operations are standard and do not involve dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The extension module is optional and is just specified as a C source file, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for packaging. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
