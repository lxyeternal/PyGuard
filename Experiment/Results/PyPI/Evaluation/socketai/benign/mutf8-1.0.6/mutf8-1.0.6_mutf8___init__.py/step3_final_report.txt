  "purpose": "Utility methods for handling character encoding peculiarities in JVM ClassFiles or object serialization archives, specifically for MUTF-8/CESU-8 encoding.",
  "sources": "Conditional import statements from external 'mutf8' package, attempting to import decode_modified_utf8 and encode_modified_utf8.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; code only imports functions without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as source points; functions are referenced but not invoked or used within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import pattern with fallback, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility module that conditionally imports functions for modified UTF-8 encoding/decoding from an external package, with a fallback import. It does not process data, execute untrusted code, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reliance on an external dependency is typical for such utilities and does not introduce malicious risk. The import fallback pattern is standard and safe. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for character encoding handling, with no malicious intent or security risks. The dependency reliance is standard and does not pose a threat. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of security concerns.",
