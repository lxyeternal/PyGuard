  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward utility module that conditionally imports functions for handling MUTF-8/CESU-8 encoding and decoding.\n- No data processing, network activity, or execution of untrusted code occurs within this snippet.\n- The import fallback pattern is standard for optional dependencies.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The only potential concern is reliance on an external 'mutf8' package, but this is typical for utility modules.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign, just imports functions, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Similar benign utility import setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Import pattern, relies on external package, no data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) due to reliance on an external package, but this is common for dependencies and does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard fallback import pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, reasonable.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as others, benign import utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, as no malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Overall very low, but the external dependency reliance justifies a small security risk (0.1) in some reports.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments needed; the reports are accurate.\n- The small security risk score of 0.1 in some reports reflects the dependency reliance, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to external dependency reliance, not malicious intent)\n\nThis code is a benign utility module with no security concerns.",
