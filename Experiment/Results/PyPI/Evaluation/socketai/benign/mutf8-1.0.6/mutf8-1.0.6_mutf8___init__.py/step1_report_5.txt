  "purpose": "Utility module for handling MUTF-8 encoding and decoding related to JVM ClassFiles or object serialization archives.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load decoding and encoding functions from the mutf8 library, with conditional fallback import.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "Import statements load functions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions for MUTF-8 encoding/decoding, handling potential import errors with a fallback import. It contains no external data input processing, no dynamic code execution, nor suspicious patterns. The structure is simple and standard for import management. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for handling character encoding conversions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a benign, well-structured import module.",
