  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No. The code is a straightforward import setup, handling optional dependencies gracefully.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The logic is simple, and the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk scores:** No risk is present; the code only imports functions.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment; no concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No. Similar to Report 1, this is just an import setup with no active data processing.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The code is clear and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are suggested.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No. The code only imports functions, no data processing or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.1—this is a slight overestimation, considering the code’s benign nature.\n- **Justification for scores:** The only minor concern is reliance on an external package, which is typical and not inherently risky.\n- **Recommendation:** The security risk score could be lowered to 0, given the absence of actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No. The pattern is standard for optional dependency handling.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, security risk at 0.1—again, an overestimation for such a benign import pattern.\n- **Justification:** No active data flow or suspicious behavior.\n- **Recommendation:** Security risk score could be set to 0.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment, with minor room for adjustment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, serving as utility imports.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are slightly conservative in reports 3 and 4, where they are 0.1, but given the context, this is acceptable as a cautious estimate. These could be lowered to 0, as no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, reflecting no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely utility setup with no malicious or risky behavior.",
