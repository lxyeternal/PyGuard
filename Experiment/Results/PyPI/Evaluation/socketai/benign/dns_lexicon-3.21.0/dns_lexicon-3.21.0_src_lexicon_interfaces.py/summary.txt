  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard abstract base class for DNS providers with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The low risk score is justified, and there is no evidence of supply chain security risks within this module. The overall security posture is high, with potential risks depending solely on subclass implementations, which are outside this code's scope."
