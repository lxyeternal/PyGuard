  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Lexicon-related error handling",
  "sources": "None (no input data reading, only class definitions)",
  "sinks": "None (no data outputs, no external calls or data processing)",
  "flows": "None (no runtime data flow, just class hierarchy definitions)",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any malicious or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no external calls or obfuscated logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. These classes serve as specific error types for handling lexicon-related errors such as provider unavailability and authentication failures. There are no external inputs, data processing, or network calls. The structure is straightforward and standard for exception handling in Python. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard definition of custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger project, providing error handling without exposing sensitive information or performing unsafe operations.",
