{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Lexicon-related errors",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are involved",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with docstrings",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, outputs, or any dynamic behavior. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or suspicious constructs are present. The structure is simple, and the purpose appears to be error handling within a larger application. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, safe set of custom exception classes for error handling. It contains no malicious behavior or security concerns. The overall security risk is negligible.",
