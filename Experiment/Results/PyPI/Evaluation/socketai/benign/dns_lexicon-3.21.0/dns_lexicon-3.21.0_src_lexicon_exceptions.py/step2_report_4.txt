  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception`:\n  - `LexiconError` (base class)\n  - `ProviderNotAvailableError`\n  - `AuthenticationError`\n- All classes contain descriptive docstrings.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Assessment of the reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and intended for error handling.\n- They correctly identify the absence of anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with best practices.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues found; the code appears to be a typical exception hierarchy for a larger project.\n- No external dependencies, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware score: 0 — no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 — clear, readable class definitions.\n- Security risk: 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe component of a larger application, serving as error handling infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or escalation is necessary.",
