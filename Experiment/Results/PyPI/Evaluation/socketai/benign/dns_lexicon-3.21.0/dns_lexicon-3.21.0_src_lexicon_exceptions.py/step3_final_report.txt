  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Lexicon project.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from built-in Exception, no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only declares classes without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, serving as error types for the Lexicon project. There are no external data inputs, network calls, dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is simple, clear, and standard for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No anomalies or risky constructs are present, and the code's purpose is purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns or malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
