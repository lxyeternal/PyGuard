  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - The classes are `LexiconError`, `ProviderNotAvailableError`, and `AuthenticationError`.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no external data inputs, no network calls, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic behavior.\n   - The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python modules.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Concerns:**\n   - The code appears to be a standard, benign exception hierarchy.\n   - No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No external dependencies or external data processing are involved.\n   - The absence of obfuscation, hidden logic, or external calls indicates no malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and their justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 for all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 for all reports. The code is benign, serving only as error class definitions.\n\n4. **Potential discrepancies or points of critique:**\n   - The reports uniformly assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The malware score is also 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and safe.\n\n5. **Additional considerations:**\n   - Since the code is only class definitions, it cannot be malicious unless used improperly elsewhere.\n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities based solely on class definitions.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No modifications or re-evaluations are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
