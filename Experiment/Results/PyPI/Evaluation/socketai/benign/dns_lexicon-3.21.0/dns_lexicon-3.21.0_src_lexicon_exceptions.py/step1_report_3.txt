  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Lexicon project to handle specific error cases related to providers and authentication.",
  "sources": "The class definitions and their docstrings; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output; no sinks indicating potential data leak or security impact.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. It includes no dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions. The purpose is to facilitate error handling within the Lexicon system. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The structure is simple, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining custom exceptions and does not contain any malicious or security-threatening behavior. It appears to be a clean, benign module for exception handling.",
