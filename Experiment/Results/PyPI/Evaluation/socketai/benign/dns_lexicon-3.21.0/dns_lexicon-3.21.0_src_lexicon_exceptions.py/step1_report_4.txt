  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Lexicon project to handle specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; no sink functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with standard class definitions; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, specifically for handling errors related to Lexicon. Each class includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external dependencies. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated patterns are present. The structure is simple and adheres to standard Python practices for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard and non-malicious. It simply provides custom exceptions for error handling in a larger project. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
