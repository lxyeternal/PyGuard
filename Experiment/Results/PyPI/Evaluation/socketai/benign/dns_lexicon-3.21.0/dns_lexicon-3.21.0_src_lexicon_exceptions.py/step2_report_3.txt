  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class.\n   - No external inputs, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports and the code itself indicate no malicious behavior or security concerns, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malware activity is present; the code is purely class definitions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n   - No challenge needed here.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (negligible security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and non-malicious.\n- Overall, the security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores correctly reflect that.",
