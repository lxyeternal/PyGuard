  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `Exception` (via a base class `LexiconError`).\n   - All classes are straightforward, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no external data inputs, network calls, dynamic code, or obfuscated logic.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Assessment:**\n   - The code is purely structural, intended for error handling.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n   - The malware score is appropriately 0.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The security risk is negligible, as the code does not perform any operations beyond defining exception classes.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, aligning with the absence of any suspicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues are present in the code or the reports.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n5. **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n   - The current scoring appears accurate and reasonable.\n   - Given the simplicity and the absence of any malicious indicators, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.",
