  "flows": "None; no data flows from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions, no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception and a base class. It contains no data processing, external data input, or network activity. The classes are straightforward and serve as error types. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues.",
