  "purpose": "Setup command-line argument parsing for the Lexicon DNS management CLI, including dynamic loading of provider modules.",
  "sources": "External provider modules loaded via load_provider_module based on user input; configuration files in the current directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; dynamic module loading could be a vector if malicious modules are introduced, but this is outside the scope of static analysis.",
  "flows": "User specifies provider -> load_provider_module is called -> provider-specific parser configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard plugin architecture; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI setup with dynamic plugin loading. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The dynamic loading depends on external modules, which could be malicious if compromised, but the code itself is benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and implements standard plugin-based CLI argument parsing. The main security consideration is trusting provider modules, which is outside this code's scope. Overall, no malicious or obfuscated elements are present, and the low risk score is justified.",
