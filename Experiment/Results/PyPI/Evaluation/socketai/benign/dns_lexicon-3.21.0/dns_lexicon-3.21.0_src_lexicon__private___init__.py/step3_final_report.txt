  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, obfuscation, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, files, network responses, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, system commands, environment variables, output functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into dynamic execution, network calls, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, complex code constructs, potential obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution functions like eval/exec, which pose risks if handling untrusted data, but no concrete malicious payloads or backdoors are observed. The code appears straightforward in most cases, with some reports noting complex or obscure constructs that could hide malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are confirmed. The overall threat level is low, with some caution warranted due to risky functions and code complexity. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation around 0.1 reflecting minimal suspicion, and security risk approximately 0.2-0.3 considering the presence of eval/exec functions and complex code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious payloads or active malicious behavior. While some functions like eval/exec and complex constructs are present, they do not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is low risk, with minor concerns about code complexity and potential obfuscation. Scores are set conservatively to reflect the low threat level, emphasizing vigilance regarding dynamic code execution in supply chain dependencies.",
