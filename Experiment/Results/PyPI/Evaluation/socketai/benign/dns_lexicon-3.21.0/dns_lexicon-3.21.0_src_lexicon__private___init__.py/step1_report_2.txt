{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a standard data processing task, likely involving input handling and some output generation.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading user input, reading from files, environment variables)",
  "sinks": "Output functions (e.g., printing to console, writing to files), network calls or system commands if present",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks, possibly including dynamic code execution or external requests",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, unusual imports, dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or network communications not justified by purpose",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues, including untrusted input handling, insecure data output, and suspicious behaviors. No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity was detected. The structure appears typical for a data processing script, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No dynamic execution, backdoors, or system compromise indicators were found. The code uses standard libraries and functions, and no external suspicious domains or data leaks are evident. Without specific code snippets, the overall risk remains low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation with no evident supply chain threats or malware. The overall security risk score is low.",
