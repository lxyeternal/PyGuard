  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious payloads or active malicious behavior. While some functions like eval/exec and complex constructs are present, they do not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is low risk, with minor concerns about code complexity and potential obfuscation. Scores are set conservatively to reflect the low threat level, emphasizing vigilance regarding dynamic code execution in supply chain dependencies."
