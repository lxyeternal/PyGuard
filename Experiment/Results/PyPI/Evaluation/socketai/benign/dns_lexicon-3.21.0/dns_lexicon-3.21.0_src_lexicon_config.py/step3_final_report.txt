  "purpose": "A flexible configuration system for Lexicon that sources configuration parameters from environment variables, command-line arguments, YAML files, dictionaries, and legacy formats, with prioritization.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (prefixed with 'LEXICON_'), argparse Namespace, YAML configuration files, dictionaries, legacy dict objects.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads data from sources, does not write or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Configuration keys are resolved from sources in order of priority; environment variables and files are read, then values are returned if present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. Uses yaml.SafeLoader, warnings are benign (deprecation notices).",
  "analysis": "The code implements a multi-source configuration resolver, reading environment variables, command-line args, YAML files, and dictionaries. It uses safe YAML loading (`yaml.SafeLoader`) to prevent code execution vulnerabilities. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. Warnings are standard deprecation notices, not security issues. The code is well-structured, purpose-driven, and employs standard practices for configuration management. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by benign warnings and standard practices.",
