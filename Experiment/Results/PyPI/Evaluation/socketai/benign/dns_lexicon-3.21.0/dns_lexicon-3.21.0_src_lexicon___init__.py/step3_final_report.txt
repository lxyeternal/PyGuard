  "purpose": "Wraps internal modules with a deprecation warning mechanism and replaces their entries in sys.modules to notify users about deprecation.",
  "sources": "Imports from lexicon._private modules (_cli, _discovery, _parser).",
  "sinks": "Replaces sys.modules entries for 'lexicon.cli', 'lexicon.parser', and 'lexicon.discovery' with DeprecatedModule instances.",
  "flows": "Access to attributes of sys.modules['lexicon.cli'], ['lexicon.parser'], ['lexicon.discovery'] triggers warnings via __getattr__ in DeprecatedModule.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward deprecation pattern with no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a DeprecatedModule class that wraps modules and issues a DeprecationWarning on attribute access. It then replaces specific sys.modules entries with instances of this class. This pattern is standard for deprecation notices. No malicious code, network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The warnings are issued during attribute access, which is typical for deprecation warnings. The replacement of sys.modules entries is a common approach to notify users about deprecated modules. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are consistent with the benign, maintenance-oriented purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign deprecation wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.",
