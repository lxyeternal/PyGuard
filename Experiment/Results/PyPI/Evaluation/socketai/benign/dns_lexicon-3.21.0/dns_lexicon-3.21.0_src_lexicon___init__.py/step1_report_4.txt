  "purpose": "Wraps private modules of the 'lexicon' package with a deprecation warning to inform users about their removal in future versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, warnings, and types modules; access to _private submodules of lexicon.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of DeprecatedModule instances to sys.modules entries; potentially affecting module loading behavior.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Wrapping modules with DeprecatedModule -> Overriding sys.modules entries -> Modules accessed by other code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom ModuleType class to wrap existing modules with warnings; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary standard libraries and internal submodules. It defines a DeprecatedModule class that issues a deprecation warning whenever an attribute is accessed. The code replaces entries in sys.modules with instances of DeprecatedModule wrapping private modules from lexicon. This pattern is often used for deprecation notices and does not exhibit malicious intent. No external data input, malicious behavior, or malicious side-effects are present. The code is straightforward and focuses on deprecation warning handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply implements a deprecation mechanism for internal modules by wrapping them with a warning-generating proxy. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It is a benign deprecation pattern commonly used in software maintenance.",
