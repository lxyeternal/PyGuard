{
  "purpose": "Wraps certain modules with a deprecation warning to notify users that these modules will be removed in a future version.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'lexicon._private' modules, which are then wrapped for deprecation warnings.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data; it only creates module wrappers.",
  "flows": "Modules imported from 'lexicon._private' are wrapped and assigned to sys.modules, so any subsequent import of these modules triggers the warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior detected. The use of warnings for deprecation is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom ModuleType class that wraps existing modules to emit a deprecation warning upon attribute access. It then replaces entries in sys.modules for specific modules with these wrapped versions. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. No signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The code appears straightforward and standard for deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation wrapper for modules, intended to warn users about upcoming removal. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
