  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports internal modules from `lexicon._private`.\n- Defines a `DeprecatedModule` class that wraps a module and issues a `DeprecationWarning` whenever an attribute is accessed.\n- Replaces entries in `sys.modules` for `'lexicon.cli'`, `'lexicon.parser'`, and `'lexicon.discovery'` with instances of `DeprecatedModule`.\n\n**Purpose & Behavior:**\n- The code's purpose is to notify users about deprecation of certain modules via warnings.\n- The approach is standard for deprecation handling, wrapping modules to emit warnings on access.\n- No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious behavior observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code correctly implements a deprecation warning mechanism. No issues or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The implementation is straightforward and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports?**  \n  - Malware: 0 in all reports — appropriate, as no malicious activity is present.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct, code is clear.\n  - Security risk: very low (mostly 0.1 or 0) — justified, as this is a benign deprecation pattern.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports consistently describe the code as a standard deprecation wrapper, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The `warnings.warn` usage is typical for deprecation notices.\n- The wrapping of modules and replacement in `sys.modules` is a common pattern.\n\n### Justification of Scores:\n- The malware score should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at **0**, as the code is clear.\n- The security risk score is appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only slight concern could be if the replacement of modules in `sys.modules` could interfere with other code, but this is a known pattern for deprecation and not inherently dangerous.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based on this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is transparent)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, standard deprecation pattern)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and well-understood. No security risks or malicious behaviors are present.**",
