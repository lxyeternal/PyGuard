  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code to ensure consistency and identify any discrepancies.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports internal modules from `lexicon._private`.\n- Defines a `DeprecatedModule` class that wraps a module and issues a `DeprecationWarning` on attribute access.\n- Replaces entries in `sys.modules` for `'lexicon.cli'`, `'lexicon.parser'`, and `'lexicon.discovery'` with instances of this wrapper.\n- The purpose appears to be to notify users about deprecation, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Deprecation wrapper for specific modules.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the pattern of wrapping modules to emit warnings. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, due to deprecation mechanism).\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code wraps modules for deprecation warnings, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious intent.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern, deprecation warnings via wrapping.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the code is standard for deprecation and contains no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no signs of malicious activity, just a deprecation wrapper.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same deprecation pattern.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard deprecation wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Critical Evaluation\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code's purpose.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent. No obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign very low risk (0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified across reports.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations\n\n- The code's behavior is straightforward: wrapping internal modules to issue deprecation warnings. This is a common and safe pattern.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned by all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly related to deprecation handling, not security.\n\n**Additional notes:** The code is benign and serves a maintenance purpose. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard deprecation wrapper with no malicious intent. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
