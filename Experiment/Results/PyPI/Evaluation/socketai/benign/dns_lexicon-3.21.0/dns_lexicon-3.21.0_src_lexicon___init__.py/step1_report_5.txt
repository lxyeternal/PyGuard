  "purpose": "To replace certain lexicon modules with deprecated wrappers that issue warnings upon access.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, warnings, and specific lexicon._private modules; usage of sys.modules to override module entries.",
  "sinks": "Access to modules and attributes via __getattr__ which could potentially be exploited if _module contains malicious code or modifications.",
  "flows": "Importing lexicon modules -> wrapping in DeprecatedModule -> assigning to sys.modules -> later access triggers __getattr__ warning.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or hidden malicious code. The code's main unusual behavior is the deliberate deprecation warnings via a wrapper class.",
  "analysis": "The script imports core modules and wraps selected modules in a custom DeprecatedModule class that issues deprecation warnings upon attribute access. It then replaces entries in sys.modules with these wrappers. This approach appears to be a standard deprecation mechanism without malicious intent. No external data inputs or outputs, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are observed. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The warnings serve as notices for users about deprecated modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation wrapper implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to inform users about upcoming deprecations and does not contain harmful or malicious logic.",
