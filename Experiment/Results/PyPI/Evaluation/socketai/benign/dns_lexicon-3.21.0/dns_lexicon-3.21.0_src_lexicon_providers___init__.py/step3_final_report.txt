  "purpose": "Dynamically discover and load provider modules for the lexicon package, issuing a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "find_providers() and load_provider_module() functions, which provide provider names and modules.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules where provider modules are injected, potentially affecting module import behavior.",
  "flows": "find_providers() supplies provider names -> load_provider_module() loads modules -> modules assigned into sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard plugin pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs plugin discovery by calling external functions to find provider names and load modules, then registers these modules into sys.modules. It issues a deprecation warning about the package. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The pattern is typical for plugin systems, with potential risks if external functions are compromised, but no evidence of malicious activity. The code is straightforward and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin discovery routine with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The main security consideration is reliance on external functions, which could be manipulated, but in this context, no malicious activity is evident.",
