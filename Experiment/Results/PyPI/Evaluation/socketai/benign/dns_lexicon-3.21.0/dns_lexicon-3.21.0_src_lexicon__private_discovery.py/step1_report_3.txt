{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to identify installed providers, check their availability, and retrieve the version of the Lexicon package.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata using importlib.metadata/importlib_metadata and pkgutil.iter_modules, and accesses _providers.__path__ to list modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks lead to untrusted data processing or external effects; the code primarily handles package metadata.",
  "flows": "The code reads package distribution data as sources and processes this data internally to determine provider availability and version, without transmitting or executing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The use of regex is straightforward, and all module imports are standard for package metadata retrieval. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and uses them to list modules, access package distribution info, and match requirements using regex. It includes typical error handling for missing packages and requirements. The _resolve_requirements function processes dependency strings to check for specific provider requirements, but does not execute or evaluate untrusted code. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The operations are confined to metadata inspection and internal logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of a package management utility, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It only interacts with package metadata and performs safe internal checks.",
