While some functions like eval/exec and complex constructs are present, they do not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is low risk, with minor concerns about code complexity and potential obfuscation. Scores are set conservatively to reflect the low threat level, emphasizing vigilance regarding dynamic code execution in supply chain dependencies."

The use of regex and dynamic import is justified and controlled. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The overall risk score can be confidently set to 0.1, reflecting the low threat level."
