{
  "purpose": "This module provides a command-line interface for the Lexicon tool, handling input/output formatting and executing DNS provider actions via the Client.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables, and configuration files; data is read from the 'results' variable obtained from client.execute().",
  "sinks": "Outputs are sent to stdout via print() calls, either as JSON strings or formatted tables; no direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input flows from CLI args and environment, processed into configuration; results from client.execute() flow into handle_output(), which then prints data either as JSON or tables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily manages data formatting and output. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles input and output, with proper use of logging, exception handling for JSON serialization, and standard data formatting routines. It relies on external modules for configuration and execution, but does not contain any malicious logic. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. The structure is straightforward, focusing on CLI interactions and output formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI interface for the Lexicon tool, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It securely manages data flow without suspicious or malicious code components.",
