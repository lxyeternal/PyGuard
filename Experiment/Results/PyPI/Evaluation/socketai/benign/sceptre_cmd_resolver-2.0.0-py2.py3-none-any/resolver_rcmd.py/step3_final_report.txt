  "purpose": "Executes shell commands via subprocess, capturing output.",
  "sources": "User-provided command argument, environment variables including SHELL and SHELL_ENCODING.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executing command, capturing stdout output.",
  "flows": "Input argument -> _get_subprocess_envs() -> subprocess.run -> output stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or suspicious code; potential command injection if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code executes arbitrary shell commands based on user input without sanitization, which can lead to command injection vulnerabilities. It constructs environment variables dynamically and executes commands via subprocess with check=True and capture_output=True. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The risk depends on input trustworthiness; the code itself is standard but potentially dangerous if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical command execution pattern with inherent security risks if inputs are untrusted. No malicious code or malware detected. The primary concern is command injection vulnerability, which is inherent in such patterns. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.6, reflecting moderate risk due to potential misuse.",
