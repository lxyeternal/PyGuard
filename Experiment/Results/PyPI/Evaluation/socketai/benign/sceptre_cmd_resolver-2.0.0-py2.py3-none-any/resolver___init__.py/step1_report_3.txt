  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or is empty.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read from external input sources such as files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any typical sinks like network communication, file writing, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from source to sink is present, as no sources or sinks are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be empty or contains no executable statements, which is unusual for a functional module. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is empty or contains no code. Without actual code, there are no observable sources, sinks, or data flows. The absence of code means no malicious activity or security risks can be identified. The overall structure offers no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears benign or incomplete. More code is needed for further assessment.",
