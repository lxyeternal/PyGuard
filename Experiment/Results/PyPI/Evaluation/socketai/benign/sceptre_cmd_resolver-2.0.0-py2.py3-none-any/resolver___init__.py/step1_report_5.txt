  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or feature within a larger Python package, but without specific context, the precise purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "Input data could originate from environment variables, user inputs, or configuration files, but no explicit data sources are clearly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands, but the provided code does not explicitly show such actions.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks are observable in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident. The code uses standard language features and structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. It lacks network activity, credential handling, or system manipulation. The absence of data input/output points suggests no malicious data flow. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or unusual patterns. Without additional context or code segments, no malicious or security-related issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and follows standard programming practices.",
