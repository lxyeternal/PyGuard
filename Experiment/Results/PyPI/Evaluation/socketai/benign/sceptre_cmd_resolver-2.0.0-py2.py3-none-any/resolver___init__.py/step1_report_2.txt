  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or computation with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data from external sources (e.g., user input, network requests, environment variables, files)",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs, network communication functions, file writes, or system commands",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. No unusual or obfuscated language features. No hidden network communications or data exfiltration routines apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly for suspicious behaviors, including hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or backdoors. No malicious behaviors or security risks were identified. The code structure and flow appear typical for standard Python scripts, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Usage of third-party libraries seems legitimate. The absence of suspicious patterns or anomalies suggests this code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a standard, benign Python script with no embedded malware or sabotage indicators.",
