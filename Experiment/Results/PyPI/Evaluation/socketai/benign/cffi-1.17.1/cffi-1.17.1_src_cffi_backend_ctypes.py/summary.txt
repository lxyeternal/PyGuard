  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ctypes-based FFI implementation with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is the potential misuse with untrusted inputs, which could lead to memory corruption or code execution. Proper validation of external data is essential to prevent exploitation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall risk score is approximately 0.5, reflecting moderate potential for misuse if inputs are not sanitized."
