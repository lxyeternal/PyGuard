  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for import across Python versions < 3.12, handling module discovery and loading.",
  "sources": "Filesystem access via os.path.isfile, open, tokenize.detect_encoding, module name and path inputs.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, filesystem checks that could leak data if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Module name/path influences filesystem checks and file opening, leading to potential data access.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code present; standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard import fallback functions with filesystem checks, encoding detection, and file opening. No network activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The filesystem access based on module names could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to import routines and not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility implementation for module import routines. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The potential security risk is minimal, related to filesystem access with untrusted input, which is typical for import mechanisms.",
