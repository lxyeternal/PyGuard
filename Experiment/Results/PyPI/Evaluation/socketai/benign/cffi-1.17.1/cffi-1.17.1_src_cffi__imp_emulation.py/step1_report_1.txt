{
  "purpose": "This code provides a compatibility layer for importing modules across different Python versions, mainly handling the differences before and after Python 3.12.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem using os.path.isfile, open, and tokenize.detect_encoding; it also accesses sys.path and module import functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if file paths or module names are influenced by untrusted input, leading to arbitrary file access. No explicit sinks for network or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (module name, path) flows into find_module, which performs filesystem checks and file reading; the open function reads files whose paths are constructed from these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic file access based on module names and paths; however, it uses standard Python libraries without obfuscation or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements module import logic compatible with Python versions before and after 3.12. It uses filesystem checks to locate module files (.py, bytecode, extensions) and opens files to detect encoding. No network access, system modifications, or obfuscated techniques are used. The filesystem access could be misused if module names or paths are untrusted, but this is typical for import mechanisms. No signs of malware or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of module import compatibility, with no malicious behavior or malware indications. It could pose security risks if used with untrusted input, but in itself, it appears safe.",
