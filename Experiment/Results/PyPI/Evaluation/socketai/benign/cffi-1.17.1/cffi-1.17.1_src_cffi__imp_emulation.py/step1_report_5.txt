{
  "purpose": "The code provides fallback mechanisms for importing modules depending on Python version, either using 'imp' or 'importlib' methods, for module discovery and loading.",
  "sources": "File system access for checking existence of files, reading files with open(), os.path functions for path manipulation, and tokenize.detect_encoding for encoding detection.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, specifically open() with potential to read untrusted files, and the use of the file data to detect encoding, which is generally safe. No data is sent externally.",
  "flows": "The code searches directories for module files, reads files to determine encoding, and loads modules dynamically using importlib machinery.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard module discovery and loading procedures. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility for module importation across Python versions. It searches directories for module files, handles different suffixes and types, detects file encodings, and loads modules dynamically. All file operations are standard and do not involve external network communication, credential handling, or data exfiltration. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate module import and loading functions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a compatibility layer for module importing, using standard library functions appropriately.",
