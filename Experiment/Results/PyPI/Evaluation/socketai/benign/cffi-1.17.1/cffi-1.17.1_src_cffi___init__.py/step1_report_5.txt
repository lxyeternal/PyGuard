{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports and imports various error and functionality classes for a package, and sets version information.",
  "sources": "Static data assignments (__all__, __version__, __version_info__, __version_verifier_modules__) and import statements from local modules (.api, .error).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily manages module exports and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic observed. The use of CRC32 for version-based module names is benign and documented.",
  "analysis": "The code solely manages module exports, version info, and imports. It uses static strings and versioning metadata. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is present. The CRC32 mention relates to internal versioning of verifier modules, not malicious obfuscation or sabotage. All imports are from local modules, with no external or suspicious network activity or code injection.\n\nBased on this, there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with versioning and import statements, showing no evidence of malicious intent or security threats.",
