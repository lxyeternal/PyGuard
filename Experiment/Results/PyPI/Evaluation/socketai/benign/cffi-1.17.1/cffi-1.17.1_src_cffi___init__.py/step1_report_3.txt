{
  "purpose": "This code manages versioning information and imports specific error and function classes for a Python package, likely related to a verification or FFI system.",
  "sources": "The code reads version strings, module file names, and imports from relative modules (.api, .error).",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that process untrusted input or data; imports are from internal modules, and version strings are hardcoded.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; version information is static, and imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of CRC32 to generate verifier module filenames based on version may be unusual but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and imports internal components. The version information and verifier module filename derivation are static and deterministic. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of CRC32 for version-based filenames is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be standard package setup code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup module for a Python package, handling exports, version info, and internal imports. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
