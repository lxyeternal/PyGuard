  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard __init__.py file, defining exports and version info. No untrusted data handling, no suspicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent, no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security issues.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear static code.\n- **Comments:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on module imports and static variables. No external data or input handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Correct; the code is standard package setup.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Notes the CRC32 usage for version-based module filenames. While somewhat unusual, it’s a benign practice for versioning or cache busting.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly elevated due to the CRC32 usage, but still within benign practices.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The mention of CRC32 is not suspicious; it’s a normal technique. The low security risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above; no external data handling, no suspicious patterns. CRC32 usage is noted as standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates the standard setup, versioning, and internal module imports. No external data or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and static.\n- **Risk Score:** Near zero, with only a minimal 0.1 assigned in one report due to CRC32 usage, which is benign.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0**.\n- The **risk score** should be **0**, given the absence of any security issues or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Note:** The CRC32-based versioning technique, while somewhat unconventional, is a standard practice in versioning and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Suggested Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware           | 0               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0               |\n| Security Risk     | 0               |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consistent findings across all reports.",
