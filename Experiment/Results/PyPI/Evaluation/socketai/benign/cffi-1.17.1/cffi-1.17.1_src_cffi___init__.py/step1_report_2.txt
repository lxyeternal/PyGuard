{
  "purpose": "Defines module exports, imports error classes and FFI from other modules, and sets version information.",
  "sources": "Reads version strings and imports modules; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; primarily static assignments and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or dynamic execution patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module-level variable assignments, imports, and documentation comments. No input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The versioning and module import statements are standard. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply sets up exports, imports dependencies, and defines version info.",
