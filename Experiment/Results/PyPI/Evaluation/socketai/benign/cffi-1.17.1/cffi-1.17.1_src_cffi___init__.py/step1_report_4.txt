{
  "purpose": "Defines and imports error classes and version information for a Python package, primarily for internal module referencing and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.api and .error), version string and version info assignments, __version_verifier_modules__ string.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external effects. No data output, network connections, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only imports and assigns static variables without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The version string in __version_verifier_modules__ appears to be a static value based on CRC32 but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module exports and version information. It imports classes for error handling, assigns version metadata, and sets a variable (__version_verifier_modules__) based on a CRC32 calculation of version data, which is a normal practice for version verification. There are no input sources, data leaks, or network operations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The version string and the CRC32-based module file name indicator are standard in version control and build processes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module setup for a Python package, involving error class imports and version info. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The CRC32-based verifier module filename is a benign implementation detail. Overall, it appears safe with no indications of malware or security issues.",
