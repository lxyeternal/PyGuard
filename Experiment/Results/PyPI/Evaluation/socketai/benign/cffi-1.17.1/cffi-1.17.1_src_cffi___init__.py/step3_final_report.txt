  "purpose": "Module initialization and version metadata setup for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Static strings (__all__, version variables), internal module imports (.api, .error). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment of variables and imports without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of CRC32 for filename derivation based on version string is unusual but standard for versioning; no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py for a Python package, defining exports and version info. It employs CRC32 for filename derivation, which is a benign versioning technique. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code, assigning malware and risk scores of 0. The use of CRC32 is not suspicious but a common practice in version management. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the code.",
