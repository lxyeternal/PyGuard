  "purpose": "Define classes and functions for handling CFFI operations, data types, and constants related to Python's foreign function interface.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static code defining constants, classes, and functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that process untrusted input; functions mainly handle internal data transformations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code mostly defines constants and simple methods without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code appears to be standard definitions for CFFI handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for CFFI operations, with methods to generate C expressions and Python byte sequences, as well as formatting functions. It includes numerous constant definitions for C data types and operations. All parts are static and do not handle external inputs or execute dynamic code. The 'VerificationError' class is imported but not used in a suspicious way. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The only potential concern could be if the constants or functions are exploited for unintended code injection, but based on this static code, that risk appears minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of definitions for handling CFFI operations and data types in Python, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as part of a larger package likely related to CFFI interface handling. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is detected.",
