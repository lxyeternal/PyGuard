  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the issues, if any, are present, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines classes, constants, and mappings for CFFI operations. No external data, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns. The analysis correctly identifies the static nature and benign purpose.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate, no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, no security risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — accurate, code is clear.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on static definitions and no external input handling. Slight concern about potential exploitation of constants, but overall benign.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the static, benign nature.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly conservative; since no external input or dynamic code, the risk is minimal.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No significant issues; the low risk score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a static utility module with constants and simple methods. No dynamic code or external data.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent, given the static nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — correct.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward, converting internal data to string or binary formats. No external data or dynamic execution.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — fitting.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, utility functions for CFFI with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and serves as utility definitions for CFFI operations.\n\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified given the static, non-executable nature.\n\n- The risk scores are low (0.2), which is reasonable considering the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- No obfuscation is present, and the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, given the static nature, but a tiny margin for potential misuse if integrated into a larger system.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present in this code snippet.",
