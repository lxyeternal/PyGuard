{
  "purpose": "Define classes, constants, and utility functions for handling CFFI operations and primitive types in a Python extension or binding context.",
  "sources": "Import from .error module; internal constant definitions and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and constants through methods to formatted string outputs, but no external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Use of class constants and formatting functions appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for representing CFFI operations with methods to convert to C expressions and Python bytes, and several constant definitions for operation and primitive types. It employs string formatting and bitwise operations without external input handling or dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or potential backdoors are present. The code appears to serve as part of a larger extension or binding system, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of constants and utility functions for CFFI handling, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious patterns.",
