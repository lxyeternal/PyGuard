  "purpose": "Utility module for handling CFFI operations, including class definitions, constants, and type mappings.",
  "sources": "Static definitions, class methods, constants, and the dynamic construction of CLASS_NAME from global variables.",
  "sinks": "No external input, data flows, or untrusted data sources; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Class methods process internal data; no external data flows or code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static. The assertion in as_c_expr could be bypassed if assertions are disabled, but this is standard behavior and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module defining classes, constants, and mappings for CFFI handling. It contains no external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The only dynamic aspect is the construction of CLASS_NAME, which is a common pattern. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The import of VerificationError is benign, and the methods perform simple data formatting and type handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0 or 0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured utility module for CFFI operations with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
