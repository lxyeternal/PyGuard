  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines classes and constants for handling CFFI operations, with no external data, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident security issues.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is static, utility-focused, and free of malicious or suspicious features.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static definitions, no external input, and standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minimal, perhaps due to the potential misuse of constants, but overall low.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; the code is standard for FFI handling.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on class methods for data transformation, with no external data or dynamic execution.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — again, very low.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; standard utility code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Describes data transformations and type mappings, with no dynamic code or external data.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard FFI utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, focusing on static data and formatting functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no malicious patterns or behaviors. The code is static, with no external data processing or dynamic code execution.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the risk scores are appropriately low (mostly 0 or 0.2).\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a static utility module for CFFI operations, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `assert` in `as_c_expr()`, which could be disabled in optimized Python runs, but this is standard and not malicious.\n- The constants and class definitions are standard and serve their purpose without risk.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because static code can sometimes be misused, but no evidence here)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-structured, and intended for internal utility within a larger system. No malicious or suspicious features are present.",
