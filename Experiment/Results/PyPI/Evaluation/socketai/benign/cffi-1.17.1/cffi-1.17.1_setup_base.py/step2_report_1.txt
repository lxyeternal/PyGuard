  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Review of the Original Code:**\n   - The code is a typical setup script for building a Python extension module using distutils.\n   - It imports configuration variables from a `setup` module.\n   - It conditionally includes the extension module based on whether the environment is PyPy or not.\n   - The extension module `_cffi_backend` is configured with include directories, sources, libraries, macros, and other compile/link args.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports are empty (\"Empty response\") with no details provided.\n   - No specific issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are described.\n\n3. **Potential Security Concerns & Checks:**\n   - Since the reports lack details, I cannot identify specific malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code appears to be a standard setup script; no obvious malware or obfuscation is present.\n   - The use of external variables (`include_dirs`, `sources`, etc.) sourced from `setup` could be a concern if those variables are maliciously altered, but there's no evidence here.\n\n4. **Error or Flaws in the Report Logic:**\n   - The reports are empty, which makes it impossible to verify claims or concerns.\n   - Without details, I cannot confirm if the issues are present or not.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no identified vulnerabilities or issues)\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no indication of malicious activity or security issues.\n   - The code is standard, and without further details, no adjustments to scores are warranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Note:** If future reports provide specific concerns or evidence, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
