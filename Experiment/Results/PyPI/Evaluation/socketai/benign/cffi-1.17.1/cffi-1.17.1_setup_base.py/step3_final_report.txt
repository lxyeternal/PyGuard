  "purpose": "Standard setup script for building a Python extension module using distutils, configuring the '_cffi_backend' extension with provided build parameters.",
  "sources": "Variables imported from 'setup' module: include_dirs, sources, libraries, define_macros, library_dirs, extra_compile_args, extra_link_args.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sources; the code does not process user input or network data.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables from 'setup' are used to define the Extension object; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The multiplication of the Extension object list with a boolean 'standard' could lead to an empty list if 'standard' is False, but this is a benign logic pattern, not an anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for compiling a Python extension module, with conditional inclusion based on environment. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The imported variables are standard for build configuration. The logic is straightforward, and no external data or user input is processed. The reports provided are empty, offering no evidence of issues. Therefore, the code appears benign and standard, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for building a Python extension module. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. The scores are set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, consistent with the analysis.",
