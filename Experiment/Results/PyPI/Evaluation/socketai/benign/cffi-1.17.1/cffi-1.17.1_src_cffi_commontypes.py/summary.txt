  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign component of an FFI system, with no malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated behavior. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal platform-specific handling but does not indicate vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and correctly scored."
