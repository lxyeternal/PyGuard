  "purpose": "Manage common data types for a Python FFI module, including platform-specific types and caching for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Import statements, platform detection, type definitions, and error handling within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted data processing involved.",
  "flows": "Type resolution functions accessing COMMON_TYPES and _CACHE, with recursive calls for unsupported types.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'set-unicode-needed' as a placeholder for deferred Unicode type handling; no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing C types in a Python FFI context, with platform-specific adjustments for Windows. It employs caching, exception handling, and recursive type resolution. No network, file, or external data interactions are present. The placeholders are typical design patterns, not indicators of malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are detected. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices in FFI type management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign component of an FFI system, with no malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated behavior. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal platform-specific handling but does not indicate vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and correctly scored.",
