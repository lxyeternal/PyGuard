{
  "purpose": "This code is intended to define and resolve common C types for use with the cffi library, particularly for Windows platform support.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, model, and FFIError; accesses _cffi_backend; reads type definitions and platform information; uses COMMON_TYPES and model.PrimitiveType to resolve types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Type definitions are read and stored in COMMON_TYPES; resolve_common_type function retrieves and processes type information, potentially recursively.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic type resolution and caching is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code sets types based on platform detection, which is normal for platform-specific type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines common types, and attempts to fetch additional types from _cffi_backend. It handles ImportError gracefully. Types are registered, including Windows-specific types when on 'win32'. The function resolve_common_type manages caching and recursive type resolution, raising FFIError for unsupported or Unicode types. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The code is typical for setting up ffi types, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward type resolution setup for cffi, primarily for Windows support. It performs no malicious actions or malicious code patterns. The code is safe and appears to serve a legitimate purpose within a Python FFI context.",
