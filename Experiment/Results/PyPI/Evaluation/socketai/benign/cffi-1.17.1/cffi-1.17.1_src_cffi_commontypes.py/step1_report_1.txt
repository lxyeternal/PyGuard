{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and manage common data types for a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) module, including type resolution and platform-specific types for Windows.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, model, FFIError, and _cffi_backend; accesses COMMON_TYPES, model.PrimitiveType.ALL_PRIMITIVE_TYPES; reads from sys.platform; accesses module attributes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted inputs that could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Type resolution uses COMMON_TYPES to retrieve or parse types; platform-specific types are added if on Windows. No data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access and type parsing functions appears standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no code injections, and no malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a type system for FFI with platform-specific types, handling import errors gracefully. It caches resolved types for efficiency and raises specific errors for unsupported types. The only dynamic behavior involves type resolution and platform-dependent type definitions, which are standard for such modules. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code structure and logic are consistent with typical FFI type management routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of type management for an FFI system, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It handles platform-specific types carefully and includes error handling. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
