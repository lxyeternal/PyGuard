{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and manage common C types for a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) in Python, handling platform-specific types, caching resolved types, and providing type resolution functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads system modules (sys), internal model attributes (model), and error handling (FFIError). It also conditionally imports _cffi_backend and accesses model.PrimitiveType.ALL_PRIMITIVE_TYPES.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data is used directly in a manner that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks. No external system calls, network operations, or file I/O with untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing system modules, populating COMMON_TYPES with system and model types, and resolving types via resolve_common_type. There are no external flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated logic is present. The code primarily manages type definitions and handles platform-specific types, with exception handling for missing modules or types.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles type definitions for a C Foreign Function Interface, with appropriate error handling and platform-specific type management. It uses caching to optimize repeated type resolution. No suspicious external calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward, with standard Python practices and no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate part of a Python FFI library, managing type definitions in a platform-aware manner. No malicious or maliciously sabotaged code is evident, and there are no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors identified.",
