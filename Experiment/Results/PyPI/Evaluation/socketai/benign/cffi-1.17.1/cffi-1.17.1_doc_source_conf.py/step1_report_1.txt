  "purpose": "Configuration file for building CFFI documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os; reads configuration parameters, extensions, paths, and metadata for documentation generation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines static configuration data without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The file contains only standard Sphinx configuration settings.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules sys and os but does not perform any dynamic operations with untrusted data. It defines configuration variables for Sphinx documentation, including extensions, paths, project info, and output options. There are no external data sources, no network connections, and no code execution beyond setting variables. The code appears to be purely static configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malware, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The overall security risk is negligible.",
