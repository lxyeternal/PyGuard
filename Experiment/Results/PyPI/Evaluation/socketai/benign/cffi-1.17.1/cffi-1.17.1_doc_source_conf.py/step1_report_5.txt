  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation build, setting parameters for generating documentation for the CFFI project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, os); variable assignments; comments; and configuration directives within the script.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly handles untrusted input or data flows to sensitive sinks such as network, file system, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident. The script primarily defines static configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx documentation configuration file, containing imports, variable assignments, and commented instructions. It does not perform any dynamic operations, input processing, or external communications. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present. It appears to be a benign, boilerplate setup script used for project documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration file for Sphinx documentation and shows no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
