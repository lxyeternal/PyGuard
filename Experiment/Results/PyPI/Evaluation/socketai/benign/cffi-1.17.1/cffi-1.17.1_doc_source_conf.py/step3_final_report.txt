  "purpose": "Static configuration file for Sphinx documentation, importing only standard modules and setting configuration variables.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`sys`, `os`), assignment of configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no network or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of configuration variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, only standard configuration practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious constructs. It only imports standard modules and sets configuration variables, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. There are no logical flaws or security concerns, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for documentation generation. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate, and the code poses no threat in the supply chain.",
