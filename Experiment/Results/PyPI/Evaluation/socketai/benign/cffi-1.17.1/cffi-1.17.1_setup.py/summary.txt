  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build configuration script for the cffi package, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It performs expected environment detection, system checks, and configuration steps necessary for cross-platform support. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified."
