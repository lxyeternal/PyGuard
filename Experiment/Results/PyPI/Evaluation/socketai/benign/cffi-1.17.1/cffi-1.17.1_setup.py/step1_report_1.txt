  "purpose": "This script automates the setup and configuration process for building the '_cffi_backend' extension module for the cffi package, including detection of system-specific features and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PKG_CONFIG, PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR, CFFI_FORCE_STATIC), system calls (subprocess, os.popen), file system (os.path.exists, os.listdir), platform information, and user input (via environment variables).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution (subprocess.Popen, os.popen), environment variable modification (os.environ['PKG_CONFIG_PATH']), file system access (os.path.exists, os.listdir), and print/write to stderr.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands and environment modifications. Subprocess commands gather system-specific flags. File system checks and system info influence configuration parameters. These configurations are ultimately used to compile and link C extension modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected. The script performs system checks, configures build options, and prepares for compiling C extensions, which are typical for setup scripts. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior evident. Use of assert statements for directory checks and compile tests is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system environment detection, subprocess calls for package configuration, and platform-specific setup for compiling a C extension. It includes environment variable handling for flexible configuration. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration code identified. The subprocess and environment manipulation appear legitimate and necessary for build processes. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The script's purpose aligns with standard setup procedures for C extension modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python C extension with system-specific configuration logic. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of subprocesses, environment variables, and file system checks is standard for such tasks. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
