  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, benign utility functions for serializing test report data into JSON format. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The slight risk score of 0.1 in some reports reflects cautious consideration of potential misuse if untrusted data is fed into serialization functions, but the code itself is secure. No changes are necessary."
