  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script or package that performs some form of data processing or functionality, but the specific intent cannot be precisely determined without analyzing the actual code content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from user inputs, environment variables, or external files/sources, depending on the specific implementation. Since no code is provided, exact sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system calls that could handle untrusted data, but specifics are not available without the code content.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks may involve processing untrusted inputs and passing them to sensitive operations such as network requests, file handling, or system commands. Exact paths cannot be identified without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be determined without examining the code. Typically, anomalies would include hardcoded secrets, suspicious network addresses, or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of specific code content, the analysis cannot definitively identify sources, sinks, or malicious patterns. Standard review steps involve checking for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or unusual control flows. The absence of provided code limits detailed assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of actual code, no definitive malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The code appears standard in structure, with no obvious signs of malware or security issues from the available information.",
