  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, external API calls, environment variables, network connections, file I/O, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, subprocess execution, environment variable access, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, unnecessary dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, unusual variable naming, or code patterns inconsistent with benign scripts.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no malicious indicators, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Confidence levels are high where code exists, and low where code is absent. Malware scores are consistently zero, matching the absence of malicious patterns. Security risk scores are mostly 0.2, reflecting cautious low concern, but could be slightly reduced where no activity is detected. The assessments are internally consistent and justified based on the provided data.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation confirms that the code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The current scoring system is appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2, reflecting minimal concern. No adjustments are necessary.",
