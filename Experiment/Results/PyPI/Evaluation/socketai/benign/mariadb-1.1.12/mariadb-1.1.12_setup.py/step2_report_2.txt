  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the described logic, potential issues, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the script performs standard setup tasks, including reading configs, setting version info, and generating a release info file.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of suspicious code.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.1), justified given the script's nature.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes standard setup procedures, platform-specific imports, and version info generation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical setup script with platform-dependent imports, configuration reading, and version info creation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard package setup logic with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, justified.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar, standard configuration and setup process.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.2, but still reasonable given the context.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code confirmation:** The code in the initial snippet is a typical setup script for a Python C extension package.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero, justified by the nature of setup scripts, which could be exploited if malicious code were present. No such evidence here.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any network activity, credential handling, or dynamic code execution that could be malicious.\n- It relies on external modules ('mariadb_posix', 'mariadb_windows') for configuration, which are not suspicious based on the provided info.\n- The process is standard for package building and configuration.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for build scripts)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears benign. The scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is a legitimate setup script with no security concerns.",
