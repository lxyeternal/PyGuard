  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package that reads configuration files, sets version info, handles platform-specific modules, and invokes setuptools.setup() to build and install the package.",
  "sources": "Reads 'site.cfg' for configuration options, platform-specific modules ('mariadb_posix' or 'mariadb_windows'), and the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata and extension modules; writes version info to 'release_info.py'.",
  "flows": "Configuration options flow from 'site.cfg' into macros and version info; platform-specific 'get_config()' function provides configuration data used in extension compilation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity; code is straightforward and typical for a build script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading configuration files, generating version info, defining macros, and invoking setup(). No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. External modules for configuration are platform-specific but not suspicious. The version info is generated dynamically and written to a Python file. No external network activity or data exfiltration is detected. The scores assigned in the initial reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk in build scripts.",
