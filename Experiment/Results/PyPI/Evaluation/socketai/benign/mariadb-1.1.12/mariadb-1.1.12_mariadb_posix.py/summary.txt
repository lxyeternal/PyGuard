  "conclusion": "The script is a standard configuration helper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection via environment variables and the use of os.popen without sanitization. No malware or malicious payloads are present. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to environmental manipulation potential, but the code itself is benign."
