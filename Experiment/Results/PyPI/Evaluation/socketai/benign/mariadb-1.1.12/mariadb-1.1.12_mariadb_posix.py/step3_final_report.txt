  "purpose": "Configure and retrieve MariaDB Connector/C information via system commands and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (MARIADB_CONFIG), external 'mariadb_config' command invoked via subprocess and os.environ",
  "sinks": "External command execution (subprocess.call, os.popen), reading environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence command paths; commands executed with environment-derived parameters",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated os.popen without sanitization; reliance on environment variables without validation",
  "analysis": "The code executes external commands based on environment variables, which could be manipulated if environment is compromised. It uses os.popen for command execution, which is outdated and potentially insecure. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The main risk stems from potential command injection if environment variables are maliciously controlled, but no malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The code performs standard configuration tasks typical in build scripts, with moderate security considerations due to external command invocation and environment variable reliance.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard configuration helper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the potential for command injection via environment variables and the use of os.popen without sanitization. No malware or malicious payloads are present. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to environmental manipulation potential, but the code itself is benign.",
