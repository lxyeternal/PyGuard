{
  "purpose": "This module provides constants and functions for interacting with MariaDB database field types and constructing date, time, and timestamp objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (`mariadb.constants`, `time`, `datetime`) and defines functions that accept parameters (e.g., Date, Time, Timestamp functions).",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code; it does not write data to external systems or perform any network operations or file access.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., date parts, time parts, ticks) flow into functions that construct datetime, date, or time objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; all functions and classes serve straightforward purposes related to data type handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of database field type constants and provides utility functions to create date, time, and timestamp objects from components or epoch ticks. It uses standard Python modules (`datetime`, `time`) without any dynamic code execution or external data handling. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for database type handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling MariaDB data types and creating date/time objects. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is straightforward and does not interact with external systems beyond standard library functions.",
