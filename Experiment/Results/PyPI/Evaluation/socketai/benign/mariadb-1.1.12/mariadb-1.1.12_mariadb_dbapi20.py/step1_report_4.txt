  "purpose": "Define data types, constants, and helper functions for database interaction with MariaDB.",
  "sources": "Import statements, constant definitions, class methods, and data construction functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; functions primarily create data objects.",
  "flows": "Data is created via function calls (e.g., Binary, Date, Time) from input parameters or system ticks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code, no unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions, constants, and utility functions for handling database types and date/time conversions. It imports necessary modules and defines classes and functions that create data objects from parameters or system ticks. The class method overrides equality checks for type verification but does not involve external data or network operations. The functions convert system ticks into date/time objects, relying on the standard Python 'time' and 'datetime' modules. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for database type handling and date/time conversions. It contains no malicious or suspicious logic, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data sinks. Overall, it is safe and serves a standard purpose within database interfacing.",
