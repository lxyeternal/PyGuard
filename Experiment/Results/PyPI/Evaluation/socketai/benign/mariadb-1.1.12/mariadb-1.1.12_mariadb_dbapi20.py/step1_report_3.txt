{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and type definitions for handling database field types and date/time objects for mariadb integration.",
  "sources": "Imports from mariadb.constants, standard Python modules (time, datetime), and class definitions/functions that generate date/time objects and type sets.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive operations such as network I/O, file access, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Input from external sources is not processed or passed through any vulnerable functions; data flow mainly involves converting ticks to date/time objects or creating byte strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. All functions serve standard purposes. The class and functions are straightforward and do not contain hidden or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and helper functions for handling database types and date/time values. It relies on standard Python modules and mariadb constants. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling present. No backdoors or malicious logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code for database interactions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It primarily facilitates data conversions and type checks without any evident security risks.",
