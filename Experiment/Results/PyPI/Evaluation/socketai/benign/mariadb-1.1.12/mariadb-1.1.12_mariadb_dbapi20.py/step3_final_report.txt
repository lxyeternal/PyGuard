  "purpose": "Utility module for handling MariaDB data types and date/time object creation functions.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from mariadb.constants.FIELD_TYPE; parameters passed to functions for creating date/time objects; system ticks in functions like DateFromTicks, TimeFromTicks, TimestampFromTicks.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., year, month, day, ticks) flow into functions that construct date/time objects; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for MariaDB field types, a custom set class for type checking, and utility functions for creating binary and date/time objects from parameters or epoch ticks. It uses standard Python modules and imported constants. No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The functions are simple constructors, and the class overrides __eq__ for set comparison. The code is clear, well-documented, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a utility module for database type handling and date/time conversions. All scores are consistent with its benign nature; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
