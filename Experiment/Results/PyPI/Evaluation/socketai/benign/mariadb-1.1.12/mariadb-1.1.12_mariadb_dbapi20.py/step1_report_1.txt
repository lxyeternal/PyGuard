{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and constants for handling database types and date/time conversions in relation to MariaDB.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (`mariadb.constants`, `time`, `datetime`) and receives parameters for date/time object creation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the functions construct date/time objects from input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions like Date, Time, Timestamp, DateFromTicks, TimeFromTicks, TimestampFromTicks are used to create date/time objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code solely constructs date/time objects and defines constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for database field types and provides utility functions for creating binary and date/time objects. There are no suspicious data flows, code injections, or external data handling. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and relies on standard Python modules and imported constants. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for database type management and date/time construction, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
