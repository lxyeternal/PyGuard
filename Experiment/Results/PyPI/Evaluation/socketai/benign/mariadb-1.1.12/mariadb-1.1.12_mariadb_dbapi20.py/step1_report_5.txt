  "purpose": "Define database type constants, type checking, and datetime utility functions for mariadb integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements, use of `time.localtime()` with input `ticks`, and constants for database field types.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sources or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "Input `ticks` passed to functions like `DateFromTicks()`, `TimeFromTicks()`, and `TimestampFromTicks()` flow into datetime constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and simple utility functions for datetime and binary data handling. The functions `DateFromTicks`, `TimeFromTicks`, and `TimestampFromTicks` use `time.localtime()` to convert numeric timestamps into date/time objects, which is standard practice. The import statements are straightforward. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are detected. The constants for database field types seem aligned with mariadb specifications. Overall, the code is conventional and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for database interaction, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It provides type definitions and safe datetime conversions. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
