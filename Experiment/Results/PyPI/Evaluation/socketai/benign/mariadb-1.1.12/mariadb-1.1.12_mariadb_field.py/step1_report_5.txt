{
  "purpose": "Map MariaDB field type and flag constants to human-readable strings and provide methods to interpret field descriptions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from 'description' tuples passed to type() and flag() methods, which contain metadata about database fields.",
  "sinks": "The methods return strings based on the input descriptions; there are no direct data sinks that handle untrusted input beyond this processing.",
  "flows": "Input 'description' tuples flow into 'type' and 'flag' methods, which map data to strings and join flags for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs straightforward mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constant mappings for MariaDB field types and flags. The 'type' method returns a string based on the second element of the description tuple if it exists in 'field_types'. The 'flag' method evaluates the eighth element of the description tuple, performs bitwise AND operations with known flags, and joins matching flags into a string. No external input processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic appears standard and safe, focusing solely on data interpretation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mapping utility for database field metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on provided metadata without any external or untrusted data handling that could be exploited.",
