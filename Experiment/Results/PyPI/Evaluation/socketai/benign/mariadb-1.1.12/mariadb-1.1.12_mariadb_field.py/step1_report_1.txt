{
  "purpose": "Define mappings for database field types and flags, and provide methods to retrieve these mappings based on a description input.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'description' in methods 'type' and 'flag', which are likely tuples or lists containing metadata about database fields.",
  "sinks": "Return values from 'type' and 'flag' methods, which could potentially be used in further processing or output, but no direct data leakage or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'description' -> methods 'type'/'flag' -> lookup in dictionaries -> return string mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No external network calls, code injection, or data leaks are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code maps database field type and flag constants to human-readable strings using dictionaries. The methods 'type' and 'flag' perform straightforward lookups. 'type' checks if the description's second element exists in 'field_types' and returns its mapped string, otherwise None. 'flag' extracts applicable flags using bitwise AND and joins their string representations. No user input is directly executed or used in insecure contexts. The code is structurally simple and safe, with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for translating database metadata constants into readable strings. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The structure and content are straightforward and safe.",
