  "purpose": "Map MariaDB field type and flag constants to human-readable strings for database schema interpretation.",
  "sources": "description[1] for field type, description[7] for flags",
  "sinks": "None; data is used only for lookups and bitwise operations",
  "flows": "type() reads description[1], flag() reads description[7], both return interpreted strings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward lookups and bitwise checks",
  "analysis": "The code imports MariaDB constants, defines mappings for types and flags, and provides methods to interpret a description tuple/list. The 'type' method safely returns a string for known types, while 'flag' evaluates bitwise flags and joins active flags. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is static, safe, and intended for data interpretation. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are detected. The code's simplicity and purpose confirm benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for mapping database schema metadata. It performs safe lookups without executing untrusted code or performing any malicious actions. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are accurate and justified.",
