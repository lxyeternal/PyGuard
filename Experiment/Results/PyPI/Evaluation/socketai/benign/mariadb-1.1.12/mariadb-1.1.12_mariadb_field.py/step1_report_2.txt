{
  "purpose": "Define mappings for MariaDB field types and flags, and provide methods to interpret these from a description.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'description' in methods 'type' and 'flag' which likely come from database schema info.",
  "sinks": "Return values of 'type' and 'flag' methods, used elsewhere in the application for database schema interpretation.",
  "flows": "Input 'description' flows into 'type' and 'flag' methods, which translate raw data to human-readable strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward lookups. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants related to MariaDB, creates dictionaries mapping field types and flags, and defines a class with methods to interpret descriptions. The 'type' method returns a string based on description[1], and the 'flag' method interprets bitwise flags from description[7] to generate a string. No input validation, sanitization, or external data manipulation is present, and the code appears purely declarative with no side effects or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard schema interpretation utility, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for schema data translation.",
