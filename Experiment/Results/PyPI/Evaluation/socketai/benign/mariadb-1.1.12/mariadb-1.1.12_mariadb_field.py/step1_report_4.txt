{
  "purpose": "This code maps MariaDB field type and flag constants to human-readable strings and provides methods to interpret field descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from the 'description' parameter passed to type() and flag() methods, which presumably contains metadata about database fields.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code. It processes data for internal use only.",
  "flows": "The methods convert numeric constants in the description to string labels, with the flag() method building a string of flags based on bitwise operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No use of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external network communication is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a mapping utility for MariaDB field type and flag constants. It performs straightforward lookups and bitwise operations. The 'type' method retrieves a string label based on a type code; the 'flag' method constructs a string representing active flags using bitwise AND. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted input beyond simple lookup operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for interpreting database field metadata with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior detected. It appears safe and intended solely for internal data processing.",
