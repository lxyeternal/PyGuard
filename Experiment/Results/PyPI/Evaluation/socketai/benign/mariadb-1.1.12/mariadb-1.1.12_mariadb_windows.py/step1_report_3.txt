  "purpose": "The script retrieves configuration settings for MariaDB Connector/C on Windows systems, including locating installation directories, checking version compatibility, and writing a configuration header file.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (MARIADB_CC_INSTALL_DIR), Windows registry (via winreg), file existence (os.path.exists), and configuration files (open and write to ./include/config_win.h).",
  "sinks": "Writes to the file './include/config_win.h'.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and registry data, then writes configuration macros to a file based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; straightforward system info retrieval and configuration generation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and registry lookups to locate MariaDB Connector/C, checks version compatibility, and writes configuration data. It uses standard Windows registry APIs and environment variables. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration. The purpose appears to be legitimate configuration setup for building or linking with MariaDB. No anomalies indicating malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical system configuration script for Windows, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It reads system data, performs version checks, and writes configuration headers. The logic is straightforward and consistent with legitimate setup tasks.",
