{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to configure MariaDB connector settings on Windows by locating installation directories and setting compilation parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('MARIADB_CC_INSTALL_DIR'), Windows registry keys ('SOFTWARE\\MariaDB Corporation\\MariaDB Connector C'), and local file paths ('./include/config_win.h').",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a configuration header file ('./include/config_win.h') and outputs version and directory information via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input flows from environment variables and registry queries; these influence directory paths and version checks. These paths are used to generate configuration data, which is written to a header file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for status reporting, which could be suppressed or manipulated. The code reads from environment variables and registry keys but does not sanitize or validate their contents explicitly. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious string manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment variable checks, registry queries, and version comparisons to determine the installation directory of MariaDB Connector/C. It then constructs include and library paths, sets compilation/linking arguments, and writes a configuration header. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is standard for Windows configuration scripts and contains no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate configuration utility for setting up MariaDB connector on Windows. It only reads system information and writes configuration files, with no malicious behavior detected. The code appears benign and appropriate for its purpose.",
