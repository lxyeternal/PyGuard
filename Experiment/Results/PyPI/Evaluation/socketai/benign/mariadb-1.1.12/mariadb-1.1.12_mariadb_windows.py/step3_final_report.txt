{
  "purpose": "Configure and locate MariaDB Connector/C on Windows systems, perform version validation, and generate configuration headers.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (MARIADB_CC_INSTALL_DIR), Windows registry keys (Connector C version and install directory), filesystem paths (install_dir parameter and include/config_win.h file).",
  "sinks": "Writes to a configuration header file, outputs status messages via print statements, and reads system registry and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and registry data as sources; processes version checks and path constructions; writes configuration header; outputs status messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; straightforward environment detection and configuration logic; no obfuscation or suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Windows environment detection for MariaDB Connector/C, including registry access, version validation, and path setup. It writes configuration headers and outputs status messages. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of print statements for status reporting is typical in build scripts but could leak info if logs are exposed; however, this is benign in context. The code's operations are consistent with legitimate setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, standard Windows configuration utility for MariaDB Connector/C. It performs environment detection, version validation, and configuration file generation without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to informational output. No adjustments are necessary.",
