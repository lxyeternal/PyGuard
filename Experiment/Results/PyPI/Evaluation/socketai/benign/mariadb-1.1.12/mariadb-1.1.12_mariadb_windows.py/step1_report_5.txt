{
  "purpose": "Configure MariaDB Connector/C settings on Windows by detecting installation directories, versions, and setting compilation/linking parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (MARIADB_CC_INSTALL_DIR), Windows registry entries (MariaDB Connector C installation info), and file system paths.",
  "sinks": "Writes to a local file './include/config_win.h'. No direct sink for untrusted input to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or registry data flows into configuration setup, affecting include and lib paths, and writing configuration header file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables and registry queries to determine installation paths; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data. The use of print statements is benign but could leak info if logs are exposed. The script relies on system-specific registry access, which is standard for Windows configuration scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment variable and registry lookups to identify the MariaDB connector installation directory and version. It checks version compatibility and writes configuration data to a header file. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious data handling were found. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The process appears to be legitimate for a setup script. Potential concern is the exposure of environment variables and registry info via print statements, but these are typical for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate Windows configuration utility for MariaDB Connector/C. It reads system data to determine configuration settings and writes a header file. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected. Overall security risk is low.",
