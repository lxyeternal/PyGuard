  "purpose": "Provides a Python module for connecting to MariaDB/MySQL databases, handling connection parameters, error management, and SSL options.",
  "sources": "Connection parameters such as host, user, password, database, SSL options, and connection pool configurations.",
  "sinks": "Connection object creation; no untrusted data flows or network activity beyond standard database connection setup.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into connection creation; no data leaks or malicious network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic present. Commented-out pooling code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard MariaDB connector module, with clear structure and no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It handles SSL options and connection pooling (commented out) appropriately. No suspicious data flows, network activity, or code injection points are evident. The security risk stems from typical connection parameters but no active vulnerabilities or malicious actions are present. The malware score is zero, obfuscation is absent, and the low risk score reflects standard connection handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard MariaDB Python connector module with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
