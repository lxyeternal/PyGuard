  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logic, code behavior, and potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard MariaDB connector with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a typical, well-structured database connector. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0.2) seem reasonable given the code's purpose and lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard connection setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward connector, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The mention of potential misuse via user inputs is valid but common for such modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0) are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the code, with potential sinks being the connection objects, but no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical for a database connector. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0.2) are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the import and connection creation, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0.2) are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the straightforward, safe nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical connector with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware (0), Obfuscated (0), Risk (0.1) seem fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 in most reports, reflecting the inherent risk in allowing external parameters to control database connections. The scores of 0.1-0.2 are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware or malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, typical for a database connector that accepts external parameters but with no evidence of misuse.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a legitimate, secure, and standard MariaDB Python connector module with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
