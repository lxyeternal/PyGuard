  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is standard metadata assignment",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string and tuple values to metadata variables. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns are evident. This appears to be typical package metadata, common in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as metadata declarations. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
