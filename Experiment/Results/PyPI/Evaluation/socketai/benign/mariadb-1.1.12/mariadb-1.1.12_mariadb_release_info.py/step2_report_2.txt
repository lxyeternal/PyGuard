  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: static assignments of `__author__`, `__version__`, and `__version_info__`.\n- The code only involves simple variable assignments with no input, output, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated patterns are mentioned or evident.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, which aligns with the actual code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; no logical errors or flaws are apparent.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - `malware`: 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n  - `obfuscated`: 0, appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n  - `securityRisk`: 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n  - `confidence`: 1, justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- The code is standard package metadata, common in Python modules.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond what the code shows.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\nGiven the consistency and correctness of the reports, and the actual code snippet, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **malware**      | 0      | No malicious activity or code present.                                                          |\n| **obfuscated**   | 0      | Clear, straightforward assignments with no obfuscation.                                         |\n| **risk**         | 0      | No security risk; code is metadata setup.                                                         |\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The risk score remains at 0 because the code is benign.\n- The malware score remains at 0; no malicious intent or behavior.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0; code is transparent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep scores at `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`.  \n- Confirm that the code is safe and not indicative of any supply chain security issue.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
