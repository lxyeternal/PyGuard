  "purpose": "Static assignment of package metadata variables (__author__, __version__, __version_info__) for informational purposes.",
  "sources": "Module-level variable assignments reading static strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static assignments without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard metadata code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no input, output, data processing, or external connections. All reports correctly identify this as benign, metadata-only code. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
