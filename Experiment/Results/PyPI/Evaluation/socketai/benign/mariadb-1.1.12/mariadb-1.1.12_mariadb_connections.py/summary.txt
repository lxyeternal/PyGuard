  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured MariaDB connector class with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score accounts for the presence of administrative functions like 'kill' and TPC commands, which are standard features but could be misused if improperly exposed. Overall, the code is safe and free of malicious intent."
