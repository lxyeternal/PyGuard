  "purpose": "The code imports and re-exports specific AWS resource detector classes from the OpenTelemetry SDK extensions for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'opentelemetry.sdk.extension.aws.resource' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of import statements and an '__all__' declaration to specify exported symbols. It includes licensing comments and standard import/export patterns. No user input handling, no network operations, no data leakage or malicious code execution pathways are present. The module appears to be a standard library or SDK component intended for modular use. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that re-exports AWS resource detector classes from the OpenTelemetry SDK extensions. There is no malicious intent or security risk detected.",
