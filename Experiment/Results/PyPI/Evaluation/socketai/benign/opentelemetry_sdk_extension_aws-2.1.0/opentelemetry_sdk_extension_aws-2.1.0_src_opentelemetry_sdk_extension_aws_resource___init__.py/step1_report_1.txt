{
  "purpose": "This code exports AWS resource detector classes from the OpenTelemetry SDK extension for AWS, enabling their use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from internal OpenTelemetry modules related to AWS resource detection.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data outputs in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports specific classes and then exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, mainly imports and exports without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several detector classes from internal OpenTelemetry AWS extensions and explicitly exposes them via the __all__ list. It includes licensing comments but no executable logic beyond imports and export definitions. No hardcoded secrets, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module that re-exports specific classes for AWS resource detection in OpenTelemetry. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident.",
