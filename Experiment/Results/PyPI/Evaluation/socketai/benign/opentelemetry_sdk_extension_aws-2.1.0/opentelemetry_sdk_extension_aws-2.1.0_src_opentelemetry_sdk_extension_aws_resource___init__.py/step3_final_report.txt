  "purpose": "This module imports specific AWS resource detector classes from the OpenTelemetry SDK extension packages and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads licensing comments and import statements from internal SDK modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to the export list (__all__), with no data processing or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard licensing comments and import/export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports specific classes from internal OpenTelemetry AWS extension modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, data handling, or suspicious patterns. The licensing comments are standard. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a confidence of 1 and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious activity are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module that re-exports AWS resource detector classes. It contains no malicious or security-compromising behavior. The scores and analysis are accurate and appropriate.",
