  "purpose": "This code module exports AWS resource detector classes for OpenTelemetry SDK extensions related to AWS.",
  "sources": "Imports from opentelemetry.sdk.extension.aws.resource.* modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the code",
  "flows": "Imports and exports data structures; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list for module exports. It does not process, execute, or handle external data or inputs. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detectable. The license and comments are standard for open-source projects. There are no signs of obfuscation or malware, and the structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for exporting AWS resource detector classes from the OpenTelemetry SDK. There are no malicious activities or security concerns detected.",
