  "purpose": "Detect AWS Lambda environment attributes and create a Resource object with those attributes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as AWS_REGION, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION, AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE.",
  "sinks": "Returning a Resource object populated with environment variable data; potential to leak environment-specific details if misused, but no direct leak in this context.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read in the detect() method, which then populates a Resource object with these values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of environment variables is standard for AWS Lambda detection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variables and uses them to create a Resource object with AWS-specific attributes. Exception handling is broad but only logs warnings or raises exceptions if configured. No suspicious or malicious code is present; it performs environment detection for resource attribution, a common pattern. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent. The use of environment variables is typical and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS Lambda resource detector implementation that reads environment variables to populate resource attributes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks; it functions as intended for environment detection.",
