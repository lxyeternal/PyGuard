  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward AWS Lambda environment detector.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code reads environment variables to create resource attributes, which is standard practice.\n- Exception handling is broad but appropriate, mainly logging warnings or raising exceptions based on configuration.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports. Given the code's nature, this seems accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which aligns with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal risk, mainly related to potential information leakage if environment variables are sensitive. However, these are standard environment variables, and no sensitive data is exposed or mishandled.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable.\n- The broad exception handling, while acceptable here, could be refined to handle specific exceptions, but it does not introduce security issues.\n- The environment variables used are standard for AWS Lambda and do not pose security risks in this context.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score could be slightly increased to around 0.2-0.3 due to the potential for environment variable exposure, but given the context, keeping it at 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (reflecting minimal, mostly informational risk)\n- **Confidence in legitimacy:** Very high, given the consistent analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe AWS Lambda resource detector with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
