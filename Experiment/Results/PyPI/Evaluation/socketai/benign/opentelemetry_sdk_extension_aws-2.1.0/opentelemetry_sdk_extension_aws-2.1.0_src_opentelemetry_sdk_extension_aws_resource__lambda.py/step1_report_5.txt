  "purpose": "Detect AWS Lambda environment attributes and create a resource representation with this information.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as AWS_REGION, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION, AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent or leaked externally in this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and used to construct a Resource object, but no external data flow or transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code reads environment variables securely and handles exceptions gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a resource detector class for AWS Lambda environments, extracting specific environment variables to populate resource attributes. It uses standard environment variables and handles errors with logging. There are no signs of malicious activity or abnormal behavior. No external network connections or data exfiltration are present. The code relies on environment variables for configuration, which is typical and safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate resource detector for AWS Lambda environments. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, and it functions as intended for resource detection.",
