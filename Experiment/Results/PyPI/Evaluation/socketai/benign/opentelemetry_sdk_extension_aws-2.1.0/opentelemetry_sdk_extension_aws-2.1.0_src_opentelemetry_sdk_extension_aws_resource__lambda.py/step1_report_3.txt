  "purpose": "Detects AWS Lambda environment attributes to create a resource object with relevant metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables such as AWS_REGION, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION, AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables to populate resource attributes; no external data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and directly mapped into resource attributes within the Resource constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation; exception handling is broad but appropriate for this context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for detecting AWS Lambda environment details based on environment variables. It safely accesses environment variables and converts the memory size to an integer. Exception handling logs warnings or raises exceptions based on configuration, but does not perform any suspicious actions or malicious activities. Usage of environment variables is standard for environment detection and does not pose security risks. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for environment detection on AWS Lambda, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply reads environment variables to create resource metadata.",
