{
  "purpose": "Detects AWS Lambda environment attributes and creates a Resource object with these attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables such as AWS_REGION, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION, AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables directly in Resource construction; logs warnings in case of exceptions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read (sources) and their values are assigned to resource attributes (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; exception handling is broad but appropriate. No suspicious dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward resource detector for AWS Lambda, extracting environment variables to set resource attributes. No data is sent over the network, no code injection, and no access to sensitive data beyond environment variables. The try-except block handles potential missing environment variables gracefully, logging warnings without exposing sensitive info. Usage of environment variables is standard for such detection and does not pose security risks. The code appears to be legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS Lambda resource detector with no malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It reads environment variables to identify Lambda environment details safely.",
