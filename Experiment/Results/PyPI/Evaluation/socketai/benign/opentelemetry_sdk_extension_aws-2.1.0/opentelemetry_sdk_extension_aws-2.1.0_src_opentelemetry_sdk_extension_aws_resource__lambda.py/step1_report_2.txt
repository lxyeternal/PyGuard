  "purpose": "Detect AWS Lambda environment attributes and return them as a Resource object for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as AWS_REGION, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION, AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE",
  "sinks": "Environment variable access, Resource creation",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables -> Creates Resource object with attributes -> Returns Resource",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Exception handling is broad but safe.",
  "analysis": "The code detects AWS Lambda environment attributes by reading specific environment variables and creating a Resource object with these attributes. It uses standard environment variable access and proper resource creation. Exception handling is broad but does not perform any unsafe operations. The code appears to be a legitimate resource detector as documented in AWS Lambda context. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. There are no suspicious network or system calls, and no hardcoded secrets are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS Lambda resource detector module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It safely reads environment variables to identify Lambda execution context and creates resource attributes accordingly.",
