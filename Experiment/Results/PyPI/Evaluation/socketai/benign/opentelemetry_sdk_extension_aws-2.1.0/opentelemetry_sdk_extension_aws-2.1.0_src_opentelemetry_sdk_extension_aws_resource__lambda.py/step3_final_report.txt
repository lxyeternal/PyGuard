  "purpose": "Detects AWS Lambda environment attributes by reading environment variables and creating a Resource object with relevant attributes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as AWS_REGION, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION, AWS_LAMBDA_LOG_STREAM_NAME, AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE",
  "sinks": "None; code only reads environment variables and constructs a resource object",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read directly in the detect() method to populate resource attributes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with broad exception handling but no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS Lambda resource detector that reads environment variables to create resource attributes. It handles exceptions broadly, logging warnings or raising errors based on configuration. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The environment variables used are typical for AWS Lambda detection. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. The broad exception handling is acceptable here, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code functions as intended for environment detection without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe AWS Lambda resource detector with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
