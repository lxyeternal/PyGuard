{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a metadata header containing licensing information and a version identifier for the open-source project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a variable assignment (__version__ = \"2.1.0\").",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely static metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or handle any data beyond the static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no executable logic, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward header with licensing comments and a version variable. It does not perform any operations, read external data, or interact with the system or network. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The confidence level of 1 is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard open-source license header with a version identifier. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and does not perform any risky operations. The assessments and scores provided are accurate and require no adjustments.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
