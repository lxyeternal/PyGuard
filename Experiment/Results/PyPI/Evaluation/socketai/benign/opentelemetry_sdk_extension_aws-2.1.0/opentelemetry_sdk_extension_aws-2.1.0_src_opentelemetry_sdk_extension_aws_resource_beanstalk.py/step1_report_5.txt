  "purpose": "Detects AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment attributes for resource telemetry.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from a file at a specific path depending on OS; loads JSON data from the file.",
  "sinks": "Uses loaded JSON data to populate resource attributes; logs warnings on exceptions.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> File open -> JSON load -> Return resource with data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. File paths are OS-specific but standard for AWS environments.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the environment (Windows or Unix), reads a configuration file if it exists, and parses JSON data to extract environment-specific attributes for AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Exception handling is broad but only logs warnings or raises errors based on a class attribute. No untrusted input processing outside file reading, no code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard resource detector for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments; it reads configuration data from known file paths and populates resource attributes accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
