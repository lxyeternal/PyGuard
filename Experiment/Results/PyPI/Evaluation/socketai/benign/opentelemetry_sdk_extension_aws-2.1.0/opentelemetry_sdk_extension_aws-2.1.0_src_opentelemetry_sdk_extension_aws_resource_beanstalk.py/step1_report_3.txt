  "purpose": "Detect AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment attributes and return them as a Resource object.",
  "sources": "Reads environment configuration file at a known path based on OS, and loads JSON data from it.",
  "sinks": "Uses loaded JSON data to populate resource attributes; no direct sink for untrusted data as the data is read from a local file.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> Parses JSON -> Populates resource attributes from parsed data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; relies on local environment configuration files. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the environment (Windows or Linux) and attempts to read a configuration file at a specific path associated with AWS Elastic Beanstalk X-Ray environment. It loads the file content as JSON and extracts specific deployment metadata to construct a Resource object. Error handling is generic, logging warnings and returning an empty resource if exceptions occur. No external network calls, code injection, or malicious logic are present. Usage appears to be standard for environment detection and resource tagging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard environment detection utility with no malicious intent. It securely reads configuration data from a local file and constructs resource attributes accordingly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
