  "purpose": "Detect AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment attributes by reading configuration files and returning them as a Resource object.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files from specific filesystem paths based on OS. Reads 'environment.conf' JSON file contents.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Reads local config file -> parses JSON -> returns Resource with attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling which can mask underlying issues; relies on configuration files that could be manipulated, but this is expected behavior for resource detection.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to detect environment-specific attributes for AWS Elastic Beanstalk by reading a local configuration file. It conditionally sets the config file path based on OS, checks file existence, and loads JSON data. It then constructs a Resource with specific attributes. The only potential concern is broad exception handling which might hide errors, but this is typical for resource detection modules and does not indicate malicious activity. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or external data exfiltration is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate resource detection implementation for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments with no malicious intent. It reads local configuration data to generate resource attributes and handles errors gracefully. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
