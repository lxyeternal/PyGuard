  "purpose": "Detects AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment attributes by reading a local configuration file and constructing a Resource object with environment details.",
  "sources": "Reads environment configuration file at OS-dependent path, parses JSON data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration involved.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> Parses JSON -> Constructs Resource with extracted attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling; reliance on local config files which could be manipulated, but this is standard for environment detection modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection by reading a known local configuration file, parsing JSON, and creating resource attributes. It contains no network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Error handling is broad but typical. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign purpose. The reliance on local files is a standard risk, not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code is a legitimate environment detection utility with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard resource detector for AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
