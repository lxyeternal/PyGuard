  "purpose": "Detect AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment attributes and return them as a Resource object.",
  "sources": "Reading environment configuration file from a specific path depending on OS.",
  "sinks": "Parsing JSON data from the environment configuration file and constructing a Resource object with extracted attributes.",
  "flows": "Read configuration file path -> Check file existence -> Open and parse JSON -> Create Resource with parsed data -> Return Resource",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward reading and parsing of local configuration files.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to detect AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment attributes by reading a local configuration file. It conditionally determines the file path based on OS, then attempts to read and parse JSON content to populate resource attributes. Error handling logs warnings but does not process untrusted input beyond file reading. No external network calls, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The purpose aligns with environment detection, which is standard in monitoring agents. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate environment detector module for AWS Elastic Beanstalk, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It responsibly reads local configuration data and handles errors gracefully.",
