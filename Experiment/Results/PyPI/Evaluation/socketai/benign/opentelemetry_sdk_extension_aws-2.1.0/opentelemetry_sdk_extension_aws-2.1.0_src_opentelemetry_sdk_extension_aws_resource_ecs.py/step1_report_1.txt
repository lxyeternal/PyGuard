{
  "purpose": "The code detects AWS ECS resource attributes and metadata for observability purposes, primarily used for monitoring and resource identification in cloud environments.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI, ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4), reading /proc/self/cgroup file, network requests to ECS metadata endpoints via urlopen.",
  "sinks": "Network request responses parsed as JSON, use of environment variables, reading system files, and merging resource attribute objects.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file reads provide data; network responses are parsed and merged into resource attributes; no untrusted data directly influences critical system functions beyond metadata fetching.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs standard ECS metadata detection with network requests and file parsing, which are typical in cloud resource detection modules. No obfuscated code, cryptic variables, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment variable checks, reads container info from a system file, makes HTTP GET requests to ECS metadata endpoints, parses JSON responses, and constructs resource attribute objects. It handles exceptions gracefully and logs warnings. The network requests are limited to well-defined ECS metadata endpoints, with no data exfiltration or malicious payloads. The resource attributes are used solely for telemetry and monitoring. There are no indications of malicious intent or harmful actions. The code appears standard for ECS resource detection and has no signs of supply chain attack vectors or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ECS resource detector for OpenTelemetry, with no malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It uses standard methods for metadata retrieval in cloud environments and contains no suspicious activity.",
