  "purpose": "Detects AWS ECS resource attributes by reading environment variables, filesystem data, and querying ECS metadata endpoints to construct resource attributes for telemetry.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI, ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4), reading /proc/self/cgroup, network requests to ECS metadata endpoints, JSON parsing of responses.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to AWS ECS metadata endpoints; no untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and filesystem -> makes HTTP GET requests to ECS metadata URLs -> parses JSON responses -> constructs and merges resource attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; exception handling broad but appropriate; no unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ECS resource detection by accessing environment variables, reading system files for container IDs, and querying AWS ECS metadata endpoints. It handles exceptions gracefully, logs warnings, and constructs resource attributes accordingly. No malicious or suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. Network requests are limited to trusted AWS endpoints, and JSON parsing is straightforward. The code's purpose aligns with common telemetry detection tasks, and no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard ECS resource detector with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. It performs expected operations in cloud environments, with low security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal concern.",
