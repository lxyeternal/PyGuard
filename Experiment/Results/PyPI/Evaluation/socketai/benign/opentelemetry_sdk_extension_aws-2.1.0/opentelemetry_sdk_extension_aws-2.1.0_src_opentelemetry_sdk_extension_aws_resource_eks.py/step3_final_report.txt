  "purpose": "Detects AWS EKS environment attributes by reading Kubernetes service account tokens, container IDs, and querying Kubernetes API endpoints to gather resource metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads token file at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token, container ID from /proc/self/cgroup, and makes HTTPS API requests to Kubernetes API endpoints with the token for cluster info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to Kubernetes API endpoints, reading local filesystem files, processing JSON responses.",
  "flows": "Reads token and container ID, then uses token in HTTPS request headers to query cluster info endpoints, processes responses to extract cluster name and container ID.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets beyond standard Kubernetes paths, no dynamic code execution or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment detection for Kubernetes/EKS clusters, using known paths and API endpoints with proper SSL context. Error handling is broad but typical. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and relies on standard mechanisms for environment introspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign resource detector for AWS EKS environments, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
