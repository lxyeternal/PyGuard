  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the technical details, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; reads token, cluster info, container ID.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; makes HTTPS requests with authorization, processes responses.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets beyond file paths.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately describes a standard Kubernetes environment detector for AWS EKS. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable, given environment detection context)\n  \n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. The logic is sound, and no issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; reads token, container info, and queries API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; uses tokens for HTTPS requests, processes JSON.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard environment detection code, securely accessing Kubernetes API with service account tokens.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - securityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified. No malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar detection logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper; makes HTTPS requests, reads system files.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard API usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate resource detection code for Kubernetes environments.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to others.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper; internal HTTPS requests, token reading.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard environment detection utility.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1 (slightly lower, justified)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; reads token, container info, queries API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper; uses Kubernetes API with token.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate detection code, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0 (fully justified)\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard Kubernetes/EKS environment detector.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 across reports, reflecting minor environment detection context but no actual security threat.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard environment detection risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate Kubernetes environment detector for AWS EKS, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
