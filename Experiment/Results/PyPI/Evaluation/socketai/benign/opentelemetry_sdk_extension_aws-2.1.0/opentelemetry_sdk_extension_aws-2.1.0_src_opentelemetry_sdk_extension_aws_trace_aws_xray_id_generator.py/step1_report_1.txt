  "purpose": "To provide a custom AWS X-Ray compatible ID generator for tracing spans in the OpenTelemetry SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.id_generator and standard Python modules 'random' and 'time'. The generate_trace_id method reads the current epoch time; generate_span_id uses the RandomIdGenerator class to generate IDs.",
  "sinks": "The generate_trace_id method produces a trace ID that could be used in tracing systems; generate_span_id produces span IDs. No direct untrusted data sinks such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "The generate_trace_id combines current time (source) with a random 96-bit number to produce a trace ID (sink). generate_span_id relies on an internal random generator. No external data flow or user input directly influences output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of standard 'random.getrandbits' for generating part of the trace ID, which is suitable for non-cryptographic purposes, and reliance on system time for timestamp. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscation or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The class provides methods to generate trace and span IDs aligned with AWS X-Ray specifications. The trace ID combines the current epoch time with a 96-bit random number, reducing rejection risk. The span ID is generated via a standard non-cryptographic random generator. No external data inputs, network activities, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward, with clear purpose and implementation. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an AWS X-Ray ID generator compatible with OpenTelemetry. It generates IDs using system time and a non-cryptographic random number generator without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is negligible.",
