  "purpose": "Detect AWS EC2 resource attributes by retrieving instance metadata.",
  "sources": "URL requests to http://169.254.169.254/latest/... for metadata and token retrieval.",
  "sinks": "URL requests to AWS metadata endpoint; potential data leakage if endpoint is compromised.",
  "flows": "Retrieving token -> fetching identity document -> fetching hostname -> constructing Resource object.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code uses standard AWS metadata API without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries to request AWS EC2 metadata and construct resource attributes. It includes proper error handling and logging. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity. The flow is straightforward: obtain token, get identity info, get hostname, assemble Resource. The URLs and request methods follow AWS guidelines. No signs of malicious code or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS EC2 resource detector that interacts with AWS metadata service as intended. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
