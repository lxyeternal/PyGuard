  "purpose": "Detects AWS EC2 resource attributes by querying instance metadata endpoints.",
  "sources": "URL requests to http://169.254.169.254 for metadata and identity information.",
  "sinks": "Data fetched from URL endpoints is used internally; no data leaks or untrusted sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Metadata URL requests -> JSON parsing -> Resource object creation with metadata attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Uses standard AWS metadata endpoints and API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to retrieve EC2 instance metadata by making HTTP requests to the AWS metadata service at 169.254.169.254. It fetches a token, then uses it to get identity and hostname data. The functions utilize standard urllib methods and handle exceptions gracefully. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected. The code operates as intended for resource detection without executing untrusted code or leaking data externally.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate AWS EC2 resource detection through standard metadata API calls. No malicious or maliciously crafted behavior identified. It appears to be a standard, well-structured resource detector with no security risks.",
