  "purpose": "Detects AWS EC2 environment attributes by querying the local metadata service and constructs a Resource object with this data.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to http://169.254.169.254/latest/ endpoints for token, identity, and hostname data.",
  "sinks": "Construction of Resource object with retrieved data; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Requests to metadata endpoints (token, identity, hostname) flow into Resource attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AWS EC2 metadata retrieval using urllib, with proper error handling and logging. It makes a PUT request to obtain a token, then uses this token to fetch identity and hostname data. The process aligns with AWS best practices. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS EC2 resource detector with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and well-justified. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
