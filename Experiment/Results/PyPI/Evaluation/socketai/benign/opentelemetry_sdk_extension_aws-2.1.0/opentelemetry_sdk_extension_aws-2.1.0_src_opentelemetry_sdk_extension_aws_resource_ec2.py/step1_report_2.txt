{
  "purpose": "This code detects AWS EC2 instance metadata and creates a resource object with relevant attributes.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to the metadata IP address (169.254.169.254), reading JSON responses, and hostname retrieval.",
  "sinks": "None directly pose data leaks or security vulnerabilities; HTTP requests are to trusted local AWS metadata endpoints.",
  "flows": "Requests are made to AWS metadata endpoints; data from these responses is parsed and used to populate resource attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard metadata retrieval without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs HTTP requests to the local AWS metadata service to gather instance details. It handles exceptions and logs errors but does not include any suspicious or malicious code. There are no data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious actions evident. The use of standard AWS metadata endpoints is expected for resource detection; no malicious behaviors such as data theft or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard AWS EC2 resource detector, designed to collect metadata for resource attributes. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior and appears to be a legitimate component of OpenTelemetry for AWS environments.",
