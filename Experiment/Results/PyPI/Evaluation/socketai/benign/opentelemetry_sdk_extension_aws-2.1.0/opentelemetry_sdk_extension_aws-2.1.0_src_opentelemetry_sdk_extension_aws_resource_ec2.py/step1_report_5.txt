  "purpose": "Detects AWS EC2 environment attributes using EC2 instance metadata service.",
  "sources": "URL requests to 169.254.169.254 for token, identity document, and hostname; JSON parsing of identity data.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code; primarily network requests and data parsing.",
  "flows": "Network requests to AWS metadata IP -> JSON parsing -> Resource object creation with fetched data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; normal network request patterns. Uses standard AWS EC2 metadata endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves EC2 metadata tokens and instance identity data via HTTP requests to a well-known AWS internal IP address. It handles errors gracefully and returns resource information. The network requests are standard for EC2 resource detection, with no unusual patterns or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets besides a fixed header name, which is standard. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks observed. The process involves straightforward network calls and JSON data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS EC2 resource detector that queries internal AWS metadata endpoints to gather environment data. No malicious intent or suspicious activity detected. The code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
