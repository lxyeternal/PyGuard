  "purpose": "Set up a benign logging configuration to prevent errors if no handlers are configured.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external sinks or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only modifies logger configuration internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, defines a static version string, and adds a NullHandler to the logger for the current module. It performs no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code follows standard best practices for logging setup in Python libraries. No issues or malicious behaviors are present, and the code's purpose is purely to prevent logging errors, which is safe and common.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign logging setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
