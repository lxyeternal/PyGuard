  "purpose": "Configure logging for the module by setting a null handler to prevent errors if no handlers are attached.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's name (__name__) to configure its logger.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs are present that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The logger setup does not involve data flow from untrusted sources; it merely initializes logging configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. The version string is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, sets a version string, and adds a NullHandler to the logger for __name__. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The purpose is purely to initialize safe logging practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
