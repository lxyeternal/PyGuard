  "purpose": "Setup logging configuration with a null handler to prevent logging errors if no other handlers are configured.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; code reads module name (__name__) for logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data is sent or leaked.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, with no unusual language features or obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, defines a version string, and attaches a NullHandler to prevent logging errors. This is standard practice for library modules to avoid 'No handlers could be found' warnings. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security issues. No external inputs, no sinks, and no data flows are present. The simplicity of the code and absence of any network activity or data manipulation suggest it's purely configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for logging setup in Python modules. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
