  "purpose": "This module provides functions to load, validate, and process JSON, YAML, and schema resources related to a resource provider framework. It includes utilities for resource loading, schema validation, and schema inlining.",
  "sources": "User or external input via resource files, resource streams, and external JSON/YAML files. Data is read from package resources, files, and in-memory objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include schema validation, logging, regex compilation, and resource copying. No direct dangerous sinks such as network communication, command execution, or file system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from resource files (JSON/YAML), through validation and inlining processes, into schema validation routines, and finally into logging or exception raising based on validation results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. Use of logging for validation warnings is appropriate. No obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, and no apparent malicious intent. Functions like resource_stream, resource_json, resource_yaml, and get_schema_store are standard resource loaders. Regex compilation and warning logs are standard validation checks. Resource validation steps involve schema validation, inlining, and warnings for schema anomalies. No hidden backdoors or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs resource loading, schema validation, and inlining without executing external or untrusted code, making use of standard libraries and well-structured validation steps. It raises specific exceptions on validation failures and logs warnings for schema issues. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors. All validation processes are safe, with no network communication, command execution, or file manipulations that could be malicious. The only potential concern is the extensive logging, which does not pose security risks but should be managed in production environments. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured resource schema handler with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a resource and schema validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard resource loading, schema validation, and inlining, with appropriate logging and error handling. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns detected, and the code does not contain malware or security risks.",
