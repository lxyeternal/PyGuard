{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for loading, validating, and processing JSON and YAML resources and schemas, including inlining references and performing schema validation with detailed warnings for anomalies.",
  "sources": "Resource streams from package data, files read via open(), and nested lookup functions extracting schema properties and patterns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed; primarily validation and logging.",
  "flows": "Resource loading → schema parsing → validation → inlining → logging warnings; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Warnings about large enums, non-ASCII characters, regex pattern validity, overlapping properties, and schema size; all are standard validation warnings, not malicious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured utility for resource and schema management, employing standard libraries and validation practices. It performs inlining and validation with comprehensive logging but does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations. Warnings are typical for schema validation and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are designed for correctness and robustness, not sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured schema and resource validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The warnings are standard and aimed at schema correctness. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal (~0.1).",
