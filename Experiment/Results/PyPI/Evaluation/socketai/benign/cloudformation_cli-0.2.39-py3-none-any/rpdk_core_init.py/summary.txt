  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard project initialization utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified due to filesystem and user input handling, which are typical in such tools. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware score 0 and obfuscation score 0."
