  "purpose": "This code manages AWS SDK sessions and credentials, including creating sessions, retrieving temporary credentials, and identifying AWS accounts.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters, environment, AWS credentials, headers, and AWS responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include use of AWS credentials, calling AWS APIs, and registering event handlers which could be exploited if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Credentials are obtained from input or AWS STS responses; credentials are passed to AWS client calls; headers are injected into requests; AWS API responses are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior detected. The code appropriately manages credentials and API calls. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on AWS credential management, including creating sessions, assuming roles, and retrieving account info. Credential data is obtained securely from AWS SDK or passed parameters. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling is evident. Event registration and API calls follow standard practices. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or malicious logic. All operations align with standard AWS SDK usage for credential management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, intended for AWS credential handling and session management. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It securely manages credentials and AWS API interactions without suspicious modifications.",
