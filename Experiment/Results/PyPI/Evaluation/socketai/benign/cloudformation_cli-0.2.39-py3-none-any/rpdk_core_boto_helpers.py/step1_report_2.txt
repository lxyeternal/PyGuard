{
  "purpose": "This code manages AWS SDK sessions and credentials, including creating sessions, retrieving temporary credentials, and obtaining account information.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data (e.g., AWS credentials, profile, region), headers for account and ARN information, and responses from AWS STS service methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses credentials to access AWS STS services, and potentially exposes account identity information.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as session credentials and headers flow into functions that generate temporary credentials or call AWS APIs, which then return sensitive information like account ID or credentials.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation; no external network communication outside AWS SDK; no unusual data handling or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes AWS sessions with proper credential validation, retrieves temporary credentials via STS, and fetches account info. It handles errors gracefully and injects headers conditionally. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. Usage of AWS SDK functions and credential handling appears standard and secure. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malware-like behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical AWS credential management tasks securely, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It relies on standard AWS SDK practices and does not contain suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
