  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard AWS credential management module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The header injection point could be misused if headers are untrusted, but this is a known pattern and not inherently malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate."
