  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI application for managing CloudFormation resource providers. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, primarily due to external YAML configuration loading, which is common but should be secured in practice."
