{
  "purpose": "This code manages AWS CloudFormation stacks and uploads files to S3, mainly for infrastructure deployment and artifact storage.",
  "sources": "Reads a YAML template from the package resources, reads a local template file for role creation, and reads input files for uploads.",
  "sinks": "Uploads files to S3; logs information and errors; describes and creates CloudFormation stacks; raises custom exceptions on errors.",
  "flows": "Reads resource stream -> Validates template -> Creates/updates CloudFormation stack -> Retrieves stack outputs -> Uploads files to S3.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code reads templates and uploads files without apparent suspicious transformations. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. Uses standard AWS SDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical AWS infrastructure and artifact uploader with error handling and logging. It reads templates from package resources or filesystem, manages CloudFormation stacks, waits for completion, and uploads files with timestamped keys. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The only potential concern might be reliance on external templates, but no malicious modifications or hidden behaviors are observed. Overall, the code appears benign and consistent with standard deployment tooling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward deployment and upload utility that interacts with AWS services using the boto3 SDK. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware are present. It is a standard implementation with proper error handling and logging, without suspicious behavior.",
