{
  "purpose": "The code manages AWS CloudFormation stacks and uploads files to S3, reading templates from resources or filesystem, creating/updating stacks, retrieving outputs, and uploading timestamped files.",
  "sources": "Reads infrastructure templates, describes stacks, and receives file objects for upload.",
  "sinks": "Creates/updates CloudFormation stacks, retrieves stack outputs, uploads files to S3.",
  "flows": "Template reading → stack creation/update → output retrieval → file upload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard AWS SDK patterns for managing CloudFormation stacks and S3 uploads, with proper error handling and validation. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on infrastructure deployment and artifact storage. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external templates and AWS permissions, which is typical for such scripts. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured infrastructure automation with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The security risk score is appropriate given the context, though it could be marginally lowered if desired. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose supply chain security concerns.",
