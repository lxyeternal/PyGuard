  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured infrastructure automation with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The security risk score is appropriate given the context, though it could be marginally lowered if desired. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose supply chain security concerns."
