{
  "purpose": "This code manages AWS CloudFormation stacks and S3 uploads for infrastructure deployment, specifically for managed uploads and roles.",
  "sources": "Reads a YAML template file from 'data/managed-upload-infrastructure.yaml' and input parameters such as file objects for upload.",
  "sinks": "Uses AWS SDK clients to create/update stacks, describe stacks, and upload files to S3; outputs the S3 URL of uploaded files.",
  "flows": "Reads template data -> creates/updates CloudFormation stacks -> retrieves stack outputs (bucket name, role ARNs) -> uploads files to S3 using obtained bucket name -> returns S3 URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; all inputs are external files or AWS SDK calls. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely interacts with AWS services, manages infrastructure stacks, and uploads files. No evidence of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or system disruption mechanisms. It reads configuration templates, waits for stack creation/update, and performs standard S3 uploads. Error handling is through custom exceptions. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code appears standard and intended for infrastructure automation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS infrastructure management utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs expected cloud resource provisioning and file uploads securely. No malware or supply chain attacks are evident.",
