  "purpose": "CLI utility for submitting AWS CloudFormation resource types, delegating to a Project class for actual submission.",
  "sources": "User input arguments parsed via argparse, project settings loaded and modified, and the project.submit() method called.",
  "sinks": "The project.submit() method, which may perform network operations or AWS API calls, but not evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> argument parsing -> settings update -> project.submit() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls detected in this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI handler that processes user arguments, updates project configuration, and delegates submission to an external Project class. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The security posture depends on the implementation of the Project class, which is not provided. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured CLI utility for AWS resource registration. The overall security risk is minimal, contingent on the external Project class implementation.",
