{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a larger application or library",
  "sources": "No data input sources; all are class definitions with no data reading or external input",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or external system interaction occurs in the code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; this is purely class declaration without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception or custom base classes. There are no input/output operations, no data manipulation, and no external calls. All classes are straightforward custom exceptions intended for error categorization within a larger system. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the structure is typical for exception handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
