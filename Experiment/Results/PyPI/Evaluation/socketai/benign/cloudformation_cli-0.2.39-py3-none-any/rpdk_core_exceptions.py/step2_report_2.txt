  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No input/output, data processing, network calls, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: error categorization and handling within a larger application.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, indicating minimal or no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears benign, with no signs of issues such as code injection, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities. The class hierarchy is straightforward, serving only to define custom exceptions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning\n**Observation:**  \nThe reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious elements. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. The analysis is consistent and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malware detected)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (correct, no security issues)\n\n**Suggestion:**  \nScores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5\n**Note:**  \nSince all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code is purely class definitions, there's no justification for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate malware score\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe malware score of 0 is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge claims based on assumptions\n**Assessment:**  \nAll reports correctly dismiss any potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on the code content. No assumptions are unjustified; the conclusion that the code is safe holds.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Check for consistency in scores\n**Observation:**  \nScores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final step: My own estimate\n**Based on the above, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security concerns. The structure is typical and does not pose any threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
