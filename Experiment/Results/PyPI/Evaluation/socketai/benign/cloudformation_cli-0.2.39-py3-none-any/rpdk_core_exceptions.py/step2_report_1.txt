  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**  \nAll reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no indications of malicious code, data input/output, or dynamic behavior. The code is static and straightforward.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and contains no malicious logic.  \n- They also correctly note the absence of obfuscation, external interactions, or suspicious patterns.  \n- No errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning; the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**  \n- All reports assign:  \n  - confidence: 1 (full confidence)  \n  - obfuscated: 0  \n  - malware: 0  \n  - securityRisk: 0  \n- These scores are reasonable given the nature of the code.  \n- No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the findings.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**  \n- The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected.  \n- The security risk score is 0, reflecting no vulnerabilities or risky behavior.  \n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, these scores are appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**  \n- The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on static code analysis.  \n- They correctly state that the code is benign and intended solely for error categorization.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure scores are consistent with the report**  \n- All scores align with the analysis.  \n- No inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.  \n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.  \n- No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution exists.  \n- The code serves a structural purpose within an application and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall security assessment confirms that this code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for error handling.  \n- The analysis and scores are consistent and justified.  \n- No malicious or security concern is evident.",
