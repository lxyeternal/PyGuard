  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Python application, primarily for error handling and categorization.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from built-in Exception classes; no data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, or security-sensitive sinks present.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance flows from custom exceptions to built-in Exception classes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for defining exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, organized hierarchically. There are no data input, external interactions, or runtime behaviors that could pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. The purpose appears to be error categorization within an application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception classes used for error handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
