  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's `Exception` or other custom exceptions. There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. The classes are straightforward, serving as error categories within an application.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code is purely class definitions with no malicious logic or vulnerabilities. No anomalies, no obfuscation, no external data handling.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears well-structured and typical for defining exception hierarchies.\n\n- **Scores given:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of Each Report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Clearly states the code defines custom exception classes for error handling.  \n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No data input/output or external interactions, only class definitions.  \n- **Anomalies:** None observed.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious behavior. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Confidence:** 1 (fully confident in the benign nature)\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns, external calls, or obfuscation.\n- No report suggests any vulnerability or malicious behavior, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the complete lack of malicious or risky elements, it should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimate:\nConsidering all the evidence, the code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security implications.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain unchanged.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0). No further action needed.",
