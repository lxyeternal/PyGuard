  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling within an application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception and custom exceptions, no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class hierarchy with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception or other custom exceptions. There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The structure is simple and typical for error categorization. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or external interactions are present. All reports agree on the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0 with full confidence. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as an error handling mechanism. No signs of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are detected. The scores are consistent with the code's benign and static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and should be maintained. No further action or concern is warranted.",
