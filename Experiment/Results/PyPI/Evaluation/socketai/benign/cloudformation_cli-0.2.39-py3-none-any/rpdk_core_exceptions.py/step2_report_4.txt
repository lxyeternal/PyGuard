  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - These classes inherit from Python's `Exception` or other custom exceptions.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python applications.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No code injection, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.\n   - No network calls, external data handling, or runtime behaviors that could be exploited.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as an exception hierarchy.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n   - They consistently state that the code is standard, straightforward, and safe.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Correctly 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: Correctly 0, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations**:\n   - Since the code is only class definitions, there's no avenue for malicious behavior in this snippet.\n   - If this code were part of a larger package, the security posture would depend on the rest of the codebase, but based solely on this, no risk exists.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- I agree with the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is safe.\n- No further action required based on this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: If in the future, this exception hierarchy is used in conjunction with dynamic code execution, external inputs, or network operations, re-evaluation would be necessary. But as it stands, this code alone poses no security threat.",
