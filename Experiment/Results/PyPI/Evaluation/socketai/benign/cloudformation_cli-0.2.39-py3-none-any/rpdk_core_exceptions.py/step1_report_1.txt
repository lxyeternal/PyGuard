  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data read occurs).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions; no suspicious logic, code injection, or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes derived from Python's Exception base class. These classes are purely structural, serving to categorize errors within an application. There are no data inputs, network calls, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The structure is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats.",
