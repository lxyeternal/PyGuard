{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Python application or library, providing specific error types for different failure scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no output or external interaction points.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code solely declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from base Exception classes. It does not perform data processing, I/O, network operations, or any logic that could be exploited maliciously. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions for custom exceptions. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a larger codebase to handle errors in a structured way.",
