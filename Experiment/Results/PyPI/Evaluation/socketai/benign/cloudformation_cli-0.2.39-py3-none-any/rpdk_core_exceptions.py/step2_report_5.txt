  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from `Exception` or other custom exceptions.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or other runtime behaviors.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Review:**\n   - The exception hierarchy appears standard and well-structured.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or deviations from typical exception class definitions.\n   - The code's purpose is clearly for error categorization within an application.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they recognize the code as purely structural.\n   - No overestimation of risk or malware presence.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n7. **Overall Justification:**\n   - Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious elements, the malware score should remain at 0.\n   - The obfuscated score should stay at 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk remains minimal, with a score of 0.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and standard.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The overall security posture is very low risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0",
