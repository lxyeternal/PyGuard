  "purpose": "Define a set of custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all are class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; only class inheritance and exception declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are not used here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class hierarchy.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class, with some subclasses further inheriting from other custom exceptions. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious behavior. The structure is typical for organized error handling. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code purely defines exception classes for application error handling and contains no malicious or security-compromising elements. It appears safe and straightforward.",
