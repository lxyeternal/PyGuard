All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics."

      "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, well-structured infrastructure automation with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The security risk score is appropriate given the context, though it could be marginally lowered if desired. Overall, the code is safe and does not pose supply chain security concerns."

The header injection point could be misused if headers are untrusted, but this is a known pattern and not inherently malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate."

The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified due to filesystem and user input handling, which are typical in such tools. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware score 0 and obfuscation score 0."

The security risk is minimal, contingent on the external Project class implementations. The assigned malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the low risk score reflects the minimal inherent vulnerabilities in this code snippet."

The low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, primarily due to external YAML configuration loading, which is common but should be secured in practice."
