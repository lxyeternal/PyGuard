{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and a registry mechanism for handling resource types, string transformations, and package name parsing, primarily for templating and resource management purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as resource_type, string, action_type, and full_package_name, which are provided by callers. No external input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data leakage, network communication, or system modifications. It primarily processes strings and raises exceptions for invalid input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments to validation and parsing functions, with results returned or exceptions raised. No external sinks or side effects are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The functions are straightforward utility functions with proper validation and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a registry for filter functions used in templating contexts, and several utility functions for parsing resource type strings, transforming string case, and extracting package prefixes. Input validation is performed via explicit checks and exceptions. No external data reads, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be standard utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions with input validation and string processing, implementing no malicious behavior or security risks. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities in this fragment.",
