{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing AWS resource types, string case conversions, and extracting package prefixes, along with registration of filters for templating purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings for resource types, package names, and arbitrary strings for case conversion functions.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return processed data without external output or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation and parsing functions, returning processed strings or components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward string parsing, validation, and formatting operations. It includes input validation that raises exceptions on invalid formats, which is standard. No external data handling, network activity, or system modifications are present. The registration of filters suggests use in templating contexts like Jinja2, but does not introduce security risks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or covert behaviors are evident. The functions are deterministic and simple, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for resource type parsing and string manipulation, with proper validation and no security concerns. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
