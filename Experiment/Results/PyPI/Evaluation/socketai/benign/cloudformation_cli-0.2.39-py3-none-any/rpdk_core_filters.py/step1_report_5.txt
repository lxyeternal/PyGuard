{
  "purpose": "This module provides various utility functions for processing resource types, string manipulations, and package name parsing, primarily intended for use in templating or configuration validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; functions operate on input arguments such as resource_type, string, or package name.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; functions do not output or write untrusted data to external systems or perform risky actions.",
  "flows": "Functions process inputs locally and return results; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with proper validation (e.g., in parse_resource_type and package_prefix). No suspicious patterns like hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for parsing resource types and manipulating strings with basic validation. parse_resource_type splits a string and raises ValueError if format is invalid; package_prefix extracts the package prefix and raises an error for invalid formats. The register_filter decorator adds functions to a registry for templating purposes. No external data reads, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected. Functions behave as expected with proper validation and no signs of backdoors or covert behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions with appropriate validation and no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for configuration or templating purposes.",
