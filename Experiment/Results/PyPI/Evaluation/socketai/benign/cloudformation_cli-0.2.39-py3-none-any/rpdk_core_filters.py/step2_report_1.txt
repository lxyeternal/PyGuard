  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Utility functions for parsing AWS resource types, string case conversions, package name extraction.\n- Registration mechanism for filters (likely for Jinja2 templates).\n- Input validation is present.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or system modifications.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Issues\n- **Code correctness:** The functions perform as described, with proper validation and straightforward logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The functions are simple parsers and string manipulators; they raise exceptions on invalid input, which is standard.\n\n### Review of the reports:\n- **Reports 1-5** all conclude the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated code are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code analysis.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The input validation is appropriate for the functions' purposes.\n- The registration mechanism is standard for templating filters.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Since there's no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** Both should remain at 0.\n- **Confidence levels:** The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, with no security concerns or malicious intent.**",
