  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Code Behavior and Logic**  \n   - All reports agree that the code consists of utility functions for string parsing, case conversion, and resource type handling.  \n   - The functions perform straightforward operations with proper validation, raising exceptions on invalid input.  \n   - No functions perform external I/O, network communication, or write untrusted data to external systems.  \n   - The registry mechanism for filters is standard for templating contexts like Jinja2.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are identified.  \n   - The input validation appears sufficient for the functions' purposes.  \n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or covert behaviors are present.\n\n3. **Malware, Obfuscation, and Risk Scores**  \n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are also 0, indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - The overall security risk is consistently 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Scores Justification & Recommendations**  \n   - The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.  \n   - No report suggests a need to increase the risk or malware scores, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.  \n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**  \n- The code is a benign utility module for resource type parsing and string manipulation.  \n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.\n\n**My own estimates for scores:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and suitable for its intended purpose without any security concerns.",
