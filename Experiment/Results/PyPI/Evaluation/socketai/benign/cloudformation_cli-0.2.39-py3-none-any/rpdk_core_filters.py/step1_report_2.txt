{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling resource types and string manipulations, mainly for use with Jinja2 templates.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: resource_type, string, full_package_name.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; functions perform string parsing and transformations only.",
  "flows": "Input data (resource_type, string, package name) flows through parsing and string manipulation functions without external data output or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed. Functions are straightforward with documented validation.",
  "analysis": "The code includes functions for parsing resource types, extracting components, converting string cases, and extracting package prefixes. All functions perform basic validation and string operations without external interactions or side effects. No indication of malicious logic, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of resource type parsing and string manipulation appears benign and intended for template processing or resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions for resource type handling and string operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
