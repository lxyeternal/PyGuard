{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling resource types and string manipulations, mainly for AWS resource types and package names.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as resource_type, string, and full_package_name.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data directly to external systems, files, or network; it mainly returns processed data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and returned through various functions, with validation and splitting operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The only potential concern is input validation, but it is standard for string parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a registry for filters and several utility functions for parsing resource type strings, string case conversions, and package name extraction. All functions perform input validation and string operations without executing untrusted data. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are evident. The validation logic is straightforward and typical for such utility modules. There are no signs of data leakage, insecure handling, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module focused on string parsing and formatting. It includes input validation but no risky operations or malicious behaviors. Overall, it is safe with no security concerns.",
