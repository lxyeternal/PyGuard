{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for resource type parsing, string manipulation, and package name processing, with registration for use in Jinja2 templates.",
  "sources": "None; all functions operate on input parameters provided at runtime or are registered filters.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return processed data without external side effects or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and returned; no external data flow or untrusted data propagation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. All functions perform straightforward parsing or string operations. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions mainly for parsing resource types, manipulating string cases, and extracting package prefixes. It includes a registration mechanism for these functions to be used as Jinja2 filters. The functions perform simple, deterministic operations with input validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe utility functions intended for template rendering and string processing. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this code segment.",
