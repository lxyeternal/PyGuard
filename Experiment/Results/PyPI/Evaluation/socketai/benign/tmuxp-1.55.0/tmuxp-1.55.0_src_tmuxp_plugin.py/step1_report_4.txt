{
  "purpose": "Define a plugin system for tmuxp with version validation and hook methods for plugin customization.",
  "sources": "Import statements (libtmux, version info, internal modules), class and function parameters, version comparison operations, configuration setup, and method definitions with parameters.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sinks such as network, file writing, or system commands that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Initialization of plugin with configuration → version checks → hook method calls with session/window objects. No untrusted data processing or external output pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors identified. The code primarily handles version validation and plugin hook definitions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plugin system for tmuxp, including configuration validation, version compatibility checks, and hook method stubs for plugins to extend. It performs version comparisons to ensure dependencies meet minimum and maximum requirements. The code is well-structured, uses assertions for validation, and raises custom exceptions for incompatibility issues. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The only potential concern could be if external plugins misuse hook methods, but this is standard in plugin architecture. The code appears safe and intended solely for plugin management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard plugin architecture with version validation and hook methods. It contains no malicious code or suspicious behavior. Its primary purpose is to facilitate plugins in tmuxp with proper version checks, and it does not process untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
