{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for logging configuration and formatting for tmuxp, including stylized log output and different formatter classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from parameters such as 'logger', 'level', and 'record', and uses internal constants like LEVEL_COLORS and LOG_LEVELS.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; code does not perform network operations, file writes, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The flow involves configuring logger handlers, setting styles for messages, and formatting log records for display; no untrusted data processing beyond standard logging inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code primarily handles logging formatting and styling with no hidden payloads or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements structured logging utilities, including functions for setting up loggers, styling messages, and custom formatters for stylized output. It uses standard Python logging features and third-party 'colorama' for terminal coloring. There are no signs of malicious intent, network activity, or data theft. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a logging utility for tmuxp, with no malicious or security-risk elements detected. It focuses solely on formatting and stylizing logs, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or security issues.",
