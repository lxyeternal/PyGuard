  "purpose": "Provides logging utilities and formatting for tmuxp, including stylized terminal output and debug templates.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (logging, time, colorama) and class/method definitions; no external data input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file, or environment variable writes; no untrusted data handling or external data effects observed.",
  "flows": "Code flow is limited to formatting and setting up loggers; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of styling libraries is for formatting only.",
