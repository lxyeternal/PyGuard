  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility designed for terminal output styling. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 can be lowered to 0 for full consistency, as no actual security concern exists."
