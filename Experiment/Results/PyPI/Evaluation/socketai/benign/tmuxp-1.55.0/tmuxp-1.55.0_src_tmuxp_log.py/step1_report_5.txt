  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for logging configuration and formatting in the tmuxp project, including setup, stylization, and detailed debug formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (logging, time, typing, colorama); configuration functions; class methods that generate formatted log strings.",
  "sinks": "No clear untrusted input sources or sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - primarily formatting and configuration functions without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation; functions perform straightforward formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines color schemes and log levels, provides functions to set up loggers and style messages, and defines custom formatters for stylized and detailed logging output. No input/output beyond standard logging and formatting is present. No external network or system manipulation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard logging utility with stylized output formatting for debugging and informational purposes. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for enhancing log readability in terminal applications.",
