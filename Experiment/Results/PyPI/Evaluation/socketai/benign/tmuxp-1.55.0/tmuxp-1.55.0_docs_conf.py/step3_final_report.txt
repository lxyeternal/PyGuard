  "flows": "exec() on __about__.py -> loading metadata; URL construction from metadata; file deletion after build.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on local metadata file, which could be manipulated if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration with dynamic URL and path handling. The main security concern is the use of exec() to load __about__.py, which could execute malicious code if the file is altered. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The exec() pattern is common but warrants trust in the integrity of __about__.py. Scores reflect minimal malicious potential but acknowledge the exec() risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Sphinx configuration script. The primary security risk stems from executing a local metadata file via exec(), which could be exploited if the file is compromised. No active malicious behavior or sabotage detected. Scores are appropriate given the context.",
