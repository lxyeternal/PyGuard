{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be the initial part of a Python package module for managing tmux sessions, primarily defining metadata and importing submodules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package and a future import for annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The comments and structure are standard for a package's initial module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports from __future__ for annotations, then imports local modules 'cli' and 'util', and imports package metadata from __about__. This is a typical setup for a Python package's main module, intended to organize imports and define package information. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The comments and license note indicate proper licensing. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard initial setup for a Python package module, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It primarily serves to organize package metadata and imports.",
