  "purpose": "Package initialization and metadata import for a Python module, likely __init__.py for a tmux session manager.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules ('cli', 'util') and metadata variables from '__about__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and metadata definitions with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, boilerplate module setup with import statements and metadata. No executable logic, network activity, or dynamic code execution exists. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and structure confirm its benign nature. Minor variations in risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are unwarranted; a score of 0 is appropriate. The confidence levels are high, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All reports are accurate; no adjustments are necessary. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe and benign.",
