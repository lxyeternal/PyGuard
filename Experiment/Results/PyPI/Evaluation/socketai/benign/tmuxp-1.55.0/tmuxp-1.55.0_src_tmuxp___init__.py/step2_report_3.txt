  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the associated scores and claims.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is straightforward, consisting solely of import statements, metadata definitions, and a docstring.\n- No data processing, external network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be package setup or module initialization for a tmux session manager.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the code as package metadata and imports.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is standard boilerplate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Similar to previous, accurate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk score (0.1). The reasoning notes no malicious behavior but acknowledges the minimal uncertainty.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — possibly due to the slight uncertainty, but given the code content, this seems unwarranted.\n- **Justification:** The code is boilerplate; no external data or security concerns.\n\n**Recommendation:** The security risk score should be lowered to 0, as there's no evidence of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with high confidence and no malware or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware scores are all appropriate (0).\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, except report 4, which has a minor 0.1.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains at 0 for all reports.\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Security risk score:** For report 4, reduce from 0.1 to 0, as the code presents no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious activity, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the content of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is standard package boilerplate, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements.\n- The minor security risk score in report 4 should be adjusted downward to 0.\n- All reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a formal consolidated report or further analysis.",
