  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, potential security implications, and consistency of the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nThe code is a collection of custom exception classes for the tmuxp project. It defines error classes for scenarios like missing sessions, windows, panes, and script errors. The code primarily constructs error messages, often incorporating user-provided identifiers, but does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain any malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward class definitions. No bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Input handling:** Parameters like `session_target`, `window_target`, etc., are used solely for message formatting. They are not used in any dangerous way (e.g., eval, system calls).\n- **External dependencies:** Imported modules are not used maliciously or insecurely.\n- **Obfuscation or malicious code:** None present.\n- **Security implications:** The code is purely structural, with no data processing beyond string concatenation for error messages.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Issue Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. This aligns with the code content; no malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as expected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, with some giving 0.5. Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. Slightly higher scores (like 0.5) seem unwarranted unless considering the potential for message injection, but since these are exception classes only, the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- **User-provided data in error messages:** The parameters included in messages are not sanitized, but since they are only used in exception messages and not executed or passed to system calls, this is not a security concern. It could, in theory, lead to information leakage if exception messages are displayed to untrusted users, but this is a standard practice and not a vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Validity of Scores:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0.\n- The risk scores should be at 0, considering no external data processing or system interaction occurs.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **No actual issues or vulnerabilities** are present.\n- The code is standard for defining exception classes.\n- The only minor concern is the inclusion of user-provided data in error messages, but this is typical and safe in this context.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural, safe, and free from malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard exception class module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing scores are appropriate; I would maintain or slightly lower the risk score to 0 for complete accuracy.",
