  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the security implications.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for the tmuxp project.\n- Exception messages are constructed using parameters, primarily for internal error reporting.\n- No external data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- External dependencies are imported but not used in a malicious manner.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify any actual issues in the code. They correctly describe the code as straightforward exception class definitions.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The constructors properly format messages, and the exception classes inherit appropriately.\n\n- **Scores and reasoning:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior?**  \n  No claims are made based on assumptions; the code is purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n- No dynamic execution, external data handling, or network communication occurs.\n- Error messages include user-provided context (like session targets), but this is typical and not inherently risky, especially since these are only used in exception messages.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is correct; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0. All reports agree; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Security Risk:\n- **Risk score:** 0 in all reports. Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The exception classes are standard, safe, and serve their purpose without introducing security concerns.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack, malicious payload, or malicious intent.\n- The code is a typical error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThese align with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. It functions solely as an internal error reporting mechanism for the tmuxp project.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and correctly implemented.",
