{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for error handling in the tmuxp project, specifically related to tmux session, window, pane management, and script execution errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external data; it primarily defines exception classes and handles error messages. No input/output sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The exception classes generate error messages, but these are for internal logging and user display. No sinks that process untrusted data or external input are identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only constructs error messages based on internal state or parameters passed during exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes used within the tmuxp project. It employs standard Python exception patterns with no external data inputs or network operations. The functions initialize error messages based on parameters but do not perform any unsafe or malicious operations. There is no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The code appears to serve as error handling infrastructure without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions for error management. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured exception module with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
