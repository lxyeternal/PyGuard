{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for the tmuxp project, primarily for handling errors related to tmux sessions, windows, panes, and script execution.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input directly; it defines exception classes and initializes error messages.",
  "sinks": "Exception message constructions and class initializations. No untrusted data flow or external system effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists as the code only defines classes and error messages without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code follows standard Python exception class patterns with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for error handling in a tmux configuration context. All classes are straightforward, inheriting from built-in exceptions or other defined exceptions. No input processing, external data handling, or system commands are present. The exception messages are static or constructed from parameters but do not involve any untrusted input. The code's structure is typical for error handling modules and contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign exception handling module for the tmuxp project. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this code segment.",
