  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the tmuxp project, including session, window, pane, workspace, and script errors.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to exception constructors (e.g., session_target, window_target, pane_target, returncode, cmd, output) used for message formatting.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages containing user-provided identifiers; used internally for error reporting only.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow into exception message strings; no external data processing or system calls occur.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for tmuxp, primarily for internal error reporting. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or external data handling are present. Exception messages incorporate parameters for context but do not process untrusted data in a risky manner. External dependencies are imported but not used maliciously. The code is clear, standard, and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. It functions solely as an internal error reporting mechanism for tmuxp. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
