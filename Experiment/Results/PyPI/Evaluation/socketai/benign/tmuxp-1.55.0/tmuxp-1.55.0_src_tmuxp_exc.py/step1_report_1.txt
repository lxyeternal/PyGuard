{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to tmuxp, a tmux session manager, including file errors, session, window, pane not found errors, and script execution errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads class instantiations, string concatenations for error messages, and imports external modules, particularly from 'libtmux' and internal compatibility modules.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs error messages through exception raising, string formatting, and class initializations. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Errors are raised with messages that may include user-provided session, window, or pane targets; these are incorporated into exception messages but are not used in insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code strictly defines exception classes with straightforward message handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of exception class definitions, with some constructors that build error messages incorporating optional target strings. There are no input parsing, data processing, or network operations. The use of string concatenation for messages with user-provided data is standard for error reporting and does not pose security issues. External dependencies are imported but not utilized in a malicious manner. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of exception class definitions intended for error handling in tmuxp. It does not include malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. There are no indications of supply chain attacks or malicious intent. The code is standard and safe.",
