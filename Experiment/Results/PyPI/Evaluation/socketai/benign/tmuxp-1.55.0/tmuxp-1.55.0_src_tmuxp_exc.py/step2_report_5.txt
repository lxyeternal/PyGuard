  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for error handling within the tmuxp project.\n- No external data processing, network operations, or code execution is present.\n- Error messages are constructed from parameters, often including user-provided strings like session, window, or pane targets.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, primarily serving as a structured way to handle and report errors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no functional or security issues.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is standard, with proper use of exception inheritance, message formatting, and no evident bugs.\n\n- **Scores given in reports?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** All describe the code as defining exception classes for tmuxp, with no external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Sinks & flows:** The exception messages are built from parameters but are used internally for error reporting only.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** All agree that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Potential issues or overlooked points:**\n- The exception classes that incorporate user-supplied strings into messages (e.g., session_target, window_target, pane_target) could, in very rare cases, lead to information leakage if error messages are displayed in untrusted contexts. However, this is a standard practice in error reporting and does not constitute malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network communication, or file operations that could be exploited.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Any higher score?**  \nNo. The code is purely structural and for error handling, with no attack vectors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a well-structured set of exception classes for internal error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features are present.\n- The error messages include user-supplied data but are used solely for internal reporting, which is standard practice.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of security issues. It does not exhibit any signs of supply chain attack or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign exception class definitions. The scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
