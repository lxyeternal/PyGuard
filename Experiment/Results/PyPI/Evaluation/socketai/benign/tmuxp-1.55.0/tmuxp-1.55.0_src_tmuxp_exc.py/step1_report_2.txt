{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the tmuxp project, including specific errors related to tmux sessions, windows, panes, and script execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as session_target, window_target, pane_target, returncode, cmd, and output. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages constructed from input parameters are used in error reporting. These messages are not directed to external systems, files, or network connections within this code.",
  "flows": "Error messages are generated from function parameters and passed to superclass constructors. No untrusted data flows to external sinks such as network or system commands within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections. All exception messages are straightforward, and no dynamic code execution or unsafe system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, primarily for internal error handling within the tmuxp tool. The exception classes format error messages based on provided parameters but do not execute any code based on untrusted inputs or perform external actions. The use of string concatenation in error messages is safe here, as they are only used for internal exception reporting. There are no signs of malware, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a standard error handling module with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of exception classes for internal error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and is designed solely for raising and formatting exceptions within the tmuxp project.",
