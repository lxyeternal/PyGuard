  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling errors related to tmuxp, a tmux session management tool.",
  "sources": "Constants for error messages, exception initialization parameters, and error handling code.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines exception classes and error messages without executing untrusted data or performing IO.",
  "flows": "Error handling paths that generate exception messages; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is standard exception class definitions, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured set of custom exceptions for tmuxp, including error messages and constructors. No input handling, network operations, or code execution is present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve error handling purposes only. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe exception class module with no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for error representation within the tmuxp application, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
