  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for launching various shells within tmuxp, with the primary security risk stemming from executing external startup scripts via exec(). No malicious activity or supply chain compromise is evident. The scores are appropriate, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and moderate risk due to external script execution. Proper validation or sandboxing of startup scripts can mitigate this risk."
