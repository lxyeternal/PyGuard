  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), network operations, obfuscated variable names",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to code execution, data exfiltration, network connections, file operations",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, inconsistent use of input validation",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits potential obfuscation and dynamic execution features, notably eval/exec, which are common vectors for malicious activity. The presence of untrusted data sources and network operations increases the security concern. However, without concrete code snippets confirming these features, the suspicion remains moderate. Benign code lacking these features shows low risk. The overall assessment hinges on verifying actual code content, but current signals suggest a moderate security posture with some obfuscation and dynamic behavior risks.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, elevating its security risk to a moderate level. While no explicit malicious payload is confirmed, the potential for misuse warrants caution. Scores are adjusted accordingly, with malware suspicion at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.4, and overall security risk at 0.4.",
