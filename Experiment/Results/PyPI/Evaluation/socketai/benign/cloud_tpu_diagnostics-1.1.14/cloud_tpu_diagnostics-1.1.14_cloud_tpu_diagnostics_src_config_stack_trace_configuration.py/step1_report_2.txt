  "purpose": "Define configuration for stack trace collection in a diagnostic tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'default' from 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics.src.util'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets static configuration attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external 'default' module for default values; no suspicious or unusual code structures. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a default configuration module and defines a dataclass for stack trace settings, including boolean flags and interval seconds. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex flows; the code appears straightforward and standard for configuration purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or malicious behavior are evident. It simply declares configuration defaults for diagnostic features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for diagnostic settings, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code activities.",
