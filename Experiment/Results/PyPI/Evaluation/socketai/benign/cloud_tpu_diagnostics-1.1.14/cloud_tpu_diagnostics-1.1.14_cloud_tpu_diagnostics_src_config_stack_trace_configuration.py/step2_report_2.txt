  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward configuration class.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- The code relies on an external 'default' module for default values, which is common practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code does not perform any data manipulation, I/O, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple data class defining configuration parameters, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- **No significant errors or flaws.**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the code is benign and standard for configuration purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1.  \n  **Is 0.1 justified?**  \n  Given the code's simplicity, a minimal risk score like 0.1 is acceptable if considering the external 'default' module as a potential vector. However, since there's no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior, a score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- **Malware score > 0.5?**  \n  No. All evidence points to benign code. The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Security risk score > 0.5?**  \n  No. The code does not introduce security risks; the minimal score (0) suffices.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and potential over/under scoring:\n- The scores are generally consistent with the code's nature.\n- The one report's 0.1 security risk score is slightly high given the benign context; a score of 0 is more justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports, code is clear.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 for all reports, as no risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall estimate:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard for configuration purposes. The scores are mostly appropriate, but the minimal security risk score should be uniformly set to 0, and malware should be 0 as well. No suspicious or malicious elements are present, and the code is straightforward.",
