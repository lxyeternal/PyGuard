  "purpose": "Import the diagnose module from cloud_tpu_diagnostics.src.diagnose, likely for diagnostic or troubleshooting purposes in cloud TPU environments.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its minimal and safe nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the context. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement for a diagnostic module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are consistent and appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
