  "purpose": "Import configuration modules related to cloud TPU diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the module 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics.src.config'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only loads modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from a specific module path. It does not process input, execute dynamic code, or perform any actions beyond importing. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The imports seem to be for configuration purposes within a diagnostic tool for cloud TPU environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of straightforward import statements for configuration modules. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
