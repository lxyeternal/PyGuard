  "purpose": "The code imports configuration modules related to cloud TPU diagnostics, likely for setting up or managing diagnostic parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics.src.config'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potentially dangerous operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to any sensitive or risky operations; just module imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a specific package related to cloud TPU diagnostics. These imports indicate the use of configuration data or settings. There are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The structure is simple and standard, with no obfuscated or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements for configuration modules with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
