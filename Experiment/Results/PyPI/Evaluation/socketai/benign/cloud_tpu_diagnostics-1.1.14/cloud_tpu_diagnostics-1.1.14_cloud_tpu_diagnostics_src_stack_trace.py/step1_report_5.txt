{
  "purpose": "The code manages stack trace dumping for debugging purposes, enabling and disabling faulthandler signal handlers, and generating trace files with timestamps.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (default.STACK_TRACE_DIR_DEFAULT), system signals (SIGUSR1), and file operations for opening/writing trace files.",
  "sinks": "Writes to a trace file or sys.stderr; no untrusted data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Signal handling triggers dumping of tracebacks to a file or console; trace files are created with timestamped filenames based on environment config.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code handles signals and file creation securely. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up signal handlers for debugging via faulthandler, allowing dump of stack traces on specific signals. It creates timestamped trace files within a specified directory. The code appears standard and well-contained, with no external data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. It includes error handling for exceptions during setup, and the file operations are straightforward. There is no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate debugging utility to dump stack traces upon receiving specific signals. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
