{
  "purpose": "The code manages signal handling and stack trace dumping for debugging purposes, creating timestamped files or writing to stderr, and registering/unregistering signal handlers (notably SIGUSR1).",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from 'stack_trace_config', accesses 'default.STACK_TRACE_DIR_DEFAULT' for directory path, and utilizes signals like SIGUSR1 and SIGSEGV.",
  "sinks": "Writes stack trace data to files or stderr; no untrusted data sources or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Signal handlers invoke 'faulthandler.dump_traceback' which writes to the designated file or stderr; signal registration connects signals to handlers; file creation occurs in '_get_stack_trace_file'.",
  "anomalies": "Predictable timestamped filenames; broad exception handling masks specific errors; no validation of directory path; no cleanup of signal handlers on shutdown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard diagnostic utility for capturing stack traces via signal handling. It creates timestamped files in a configurable directory, registers signal handlers for SIGUSR1 and others, and manages enabling/disabling of dump functionality. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or network activity are present. The only minor concern is the predictability of filenames, which is typical for logs. Broad exception handling is used but is common in such utilities. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign diagnostic tool for capturing stack traces upon signals. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and very low risk score (~0.2) are justified. The code's behavior aligns with standard debugging practices, and no security threats are evident.",
