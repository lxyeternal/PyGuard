{
  "purpose": "Provides debugging functionality by enabling stack trace dumping and sending periodic signals to the main thread for diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from debug_config, accesses threading events, thread creation, and system signals.",
  "sinks": "Sends SIGUSR1 signals to the main thread using signal.pthread_kill.",
  "flows": "Initialization reads debug_config; if configured, starts a daemon thread that periodically sends signals; signals are sent via signal.pthread_kill to the main thread.",
  "anomalies": "Uses thread identifiers and system signals in a manner that could be exploited if misused, but overall this is a standard diagnostic approach. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious backdoors identified. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages debugging by starting a background thread that periodically sends SIGUSR1 signals to the main thread for diagnostics, controlled via a configuration object. Signal handling and thread management are straightforward. There is no code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads present. The use of signal.pthread_kill is a standard debugging technique. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscation observed. The code appears to be a legitimate debugging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a debugging aid, enabling stack trace collection and periodic signaling for diagnostics. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. It is a standard implementation for diagnostic purposes with no significant security risks.",
