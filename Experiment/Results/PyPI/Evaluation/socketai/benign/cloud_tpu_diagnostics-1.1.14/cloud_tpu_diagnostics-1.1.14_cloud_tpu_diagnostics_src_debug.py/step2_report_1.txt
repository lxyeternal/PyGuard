  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a debugging utility that manages stack trace collection via threading and signal handling.\n- The core functionality involves starting/stopping a background thread that periodically sends SIGUSR1 signals to the main thread.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The use of signals and threading is standard for debugging, though it could be misused if configuration is malicious or signals are hijacked.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Issue Presence\n- **Issue presence:** No report indicates actual malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears to function as intended for debugging purposes, with proper thread management and signal handling.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is intended for debugging, with no evident malicious intent.\n- They note that misuse could occur if `debug_config` is maliciously altered or if signals are hijacked, but this is typical for debugging tools.\n- No false claims or unwarranted concerns are apparent.\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern but acknowledging potential misuse if configuration is compromised.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code is standard debugging infrastructure with no malicious behavior. The small security risk score accounts for potential misuse if configuration is malicious or signals hijacked.\n\n### Potential Risks & Assumptions\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the use of signals and threading.\n- They recognize that if `debug_config` is maliciously manipulated, the behavior could be exploited, but this is inherent to debugging code.\n\n### Recommendations\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed unless new evidence emerges.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly related to potential misuse if configuration is malicious.\n\n**Overall:** The code is a legitimate debugging utility with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, intended for internal diagnostics.  \n- No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.  \n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores.",
