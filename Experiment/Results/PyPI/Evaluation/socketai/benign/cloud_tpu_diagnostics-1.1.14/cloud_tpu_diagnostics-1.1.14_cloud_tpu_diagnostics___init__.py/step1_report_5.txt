{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to cloud TPU diagnostics, likely for diagnostics or configuration tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics' package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; only import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; just module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is limited to imports, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from a package named 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics'. There are no data inputs, no function calls, or data handling. The imports appear to be standard for a module that provides diagnostic and configuration functionalities for Cloud TPU diagnostics. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is evident. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements for a diagnostics package related to Cloud TPU. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
