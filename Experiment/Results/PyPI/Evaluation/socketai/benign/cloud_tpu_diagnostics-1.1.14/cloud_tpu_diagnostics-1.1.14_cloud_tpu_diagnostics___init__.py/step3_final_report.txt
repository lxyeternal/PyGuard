  "purpose": "Import modules from 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics' for diagnostics and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics' package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "Import statements are straightforward; no data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; minimal and benign code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements with no dynamic execution, data handling, or user input. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet. No further concerns are warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
