  "purpose": "Configuration holder for debugging, specifically for stack trace collection settings.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics.src.config' and standard modules 'dataclasses' and 'typing.Optional'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static configuration data.",
  "flows": "N/A - purely declarative data class with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple Python data class 'DebugConfig' with an optional attribute 'stack_trace_config' referencing an external configuration class. It imports standard modules and a specific class from an external package. The code is static, with no input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent and appropriate. No further analysis or modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration data class with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. The overall security assessment is that this code poses no threat.",
