  "purpose": "Define a configuration data class for debugging, specifically for stack trace collection.",
  "sources": "Import statements for dataclasses, typing.Optional, and a custom configuration class from a specific module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations observed; class attribute assignment is static.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a dataclass 'DebugConfig' with a single optional attribute 'stack_trace_config' referencing an external configuration class. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a configuration purpose without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
