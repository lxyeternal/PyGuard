  "purpose": "Define a DebugConfig data class for debugging configuration related to stack trace collection.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics.src.config' to access StackTraceConfig class.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines a configuration class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward class definition with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a dataclass DebugConfig with a single optional attribute for stack trace configuration. The attribute defaults to None. There are no dynamic executions, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns. No external data inputs are processed, and no outputs or network activities are present. The purpose appears to be standard configuration setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard configuration data class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to pose any security threat.",
