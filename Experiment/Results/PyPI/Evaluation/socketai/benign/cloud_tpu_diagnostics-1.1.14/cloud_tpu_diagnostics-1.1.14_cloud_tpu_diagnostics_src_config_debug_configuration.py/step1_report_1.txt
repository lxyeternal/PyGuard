  "purpose": "Define a configuration data class for debugging, specifically related to stack trace collection.",
  "sources": "Import of configuration class from 'cloud_tpu_diagnostics.src.config' and use of class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply declares a data class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and a specific configuration class. It defines a data class 'DebugConfig' with a single optional attribute 'stack_trace_config' that defaults to None. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward, serving as a configuration holder without any malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration data class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines a structure for debugging configuration, with no indications of sabotage, malware, or security issues.",
