  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a specific configuration class. It defines a simple dataclass with an optional attribute for debugging configuration. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no insecure or malicious patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration data holder without any malicious intent or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
