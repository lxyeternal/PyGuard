  "purpose": "Configuration holder for diagnostic settings, specifically managing debug configuration options.",
  "sources": "Import of 'debug_configuration.DebugConfig' from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is purely structural.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the class is used for configuration storage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data class with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple dataclass with an optional attribute referencing an external configuration class. It involves no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The only potential concern could be the imported class, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet. The code's simplicity and clarity support a high confidence in its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration data class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
