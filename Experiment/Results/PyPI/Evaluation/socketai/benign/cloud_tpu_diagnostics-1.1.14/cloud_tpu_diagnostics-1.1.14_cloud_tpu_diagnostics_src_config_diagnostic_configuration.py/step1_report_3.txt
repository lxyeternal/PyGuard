  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leakage or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a straightforward class definition with no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a simple dataclass with an optional debug configuration attribute. The imported modules are standard and relevant for configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard configuration class with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration data class with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines a data structure for configuration purposes.",
