{
  "purpose": "Provides a context manager for debugging and error identification using external debugging functions.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'config' parameter and its 'debug_config' attribute.",
  "sinks": "Calls external functions 'start_debugging' and 'stop_debugging' with 'debug_config' as argument.",
  "flows": "From 'config' and 'config.debug_config' to 'start_debugging' and 'stop_debugging' functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that conditionally invokes debugging functions based on the provided 'config'. It imports debugging functions and wraps their invocation within a try-finally block to ensure proper cleanup. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The external functions 'start_debugging' and 'stop_debugging' are assumed to be benign or related to debugging processes. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard debugging utility without malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages debugging sessions based on configuration. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
