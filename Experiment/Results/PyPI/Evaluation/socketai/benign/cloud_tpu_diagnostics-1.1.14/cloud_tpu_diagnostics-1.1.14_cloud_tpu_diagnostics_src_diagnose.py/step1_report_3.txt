{
  "purpose": "Provides a context manager to enable and disable debugging based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'config' object and its 'debug_config' attribute.",
  "sinks": "Calls start_debugging() and stop_debugging() functions with 'debug_config' as argument.",
  "flows": "From 'config' object to debugging functions via 'debug_config' attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager 'diagnose' that manages debugging sessions by calling start_debugging and stop_debugging functions based on the provided configuration. It performs standard null checks before invoking these functions. No untrusted data handling, external inputs, or obfuscated logic is present. The functions called are imported from an internal module, and their implementation is not provided here. The code is straightforward and typical for debugging context management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard debugging utility with no indicators of malicious intent. It simply manages debugging state based on configuration without involving any harmful or suspicious operations.",
