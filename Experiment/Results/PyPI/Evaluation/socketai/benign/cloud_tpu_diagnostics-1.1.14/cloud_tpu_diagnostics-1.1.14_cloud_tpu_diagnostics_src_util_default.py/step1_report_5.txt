  "purpose": "Define default configuration values for stack trace collection and reporting in a debugging or monitoring system.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are used as configuration defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward constant assignments setting default parameters for debugging features. There are no input handling, external data access, or dynamic code execution. All values are static and intended for internal configuration purposes. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely configuration with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears as standard setup code for debugging features.",
