  "purpose": "Define default configuration values for stack trace collection and debugging.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments defining default values, including a directory path.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only constant assignments without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable point is the default path '/tmp/debugging/', which is a common temporary directory but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets default boolean flags and a directory path for debugging purposes. The path is hardcoded to '/tmp/debugging/', which is typical for temporary debugging files. No user input, external data, or sensitive information is involved. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious intent is present. The code appears to serve configuration purposes only, with no complex logic or data flow that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as configuration defaults for debugging features. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
