  "purpose": "Configuration setup for debugging and stack trace collection defaults.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static default values to configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of constant assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns fixed default values to debugging configuration variables, including booleans and a directory path. There are no dynamic inputs, external data interactions, or suspicious patterns. The directory path '/tmp/debugging/' is standard for temporary debugging files. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate a benign configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
