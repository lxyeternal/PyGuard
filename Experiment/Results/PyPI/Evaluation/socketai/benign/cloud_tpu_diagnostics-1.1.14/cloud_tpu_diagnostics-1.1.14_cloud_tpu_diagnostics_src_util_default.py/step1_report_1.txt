  "anomalies": "Use of '/tmp/debugging/' as a directory path, which may be used for debugging purposes, but nothing suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code sets static default configuration flags and a directory path for debugging or stack trace collection. The boolean flags are set to False, indicating disabled features, and the directory path is a typical temporary directory. There are no dynamic inputs, no data handling, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code is simple configuration initialization, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines default configuration values for debugging purposes, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
