  "purpose": "Define default configuration values for stack trace collection, cloud reporting, directory path, and interval timing in debugging or monitoring.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments for configuration defaults.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A, only static assignment of constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; all values are standard configuration defaults.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines four default configuration variables related to stack trace collection and debugging. All values are static and hardcoded, serving as default parameters. There is no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data manipulation. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be benign, standard practice for setting default debugging parameters.",
