  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns default boolean values and a directory path to configuration variables. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The directory path is a static string pointing to '/tmp/debugging/', which is a standard temporary directory. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues within these assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a straightforward configuration setup without malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
