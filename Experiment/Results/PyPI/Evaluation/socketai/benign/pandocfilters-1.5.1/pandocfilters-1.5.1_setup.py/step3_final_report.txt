{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'pandocfilters'. It defines package metadata and reads a README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file using the read() function; static metadata provided directly in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Reads local file 'README.rst' and passes static metadata to setup() without dynamic or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup code; use of 'distutils.core.setup' instead of 'setuptools.setup' is outdated but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. It reads a local file without validation, which is typical in such scripts. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The use of 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools' is outdated but not suspicious. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
