  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pandocfilters' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, importing setuptools and distutils, environment variables via os module.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or output involved.",
  "flows": "Reading README file (source) during setup (sink). No data flow to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of modern 'setuptools' for setup; however, not inherently malicious. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a function to read a file, and calls setup() with package metadata. It does not include any network operations, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data. The use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
