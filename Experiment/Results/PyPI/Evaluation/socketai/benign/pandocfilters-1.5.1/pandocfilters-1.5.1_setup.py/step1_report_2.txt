{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pandocfilters' Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation.",
  "sources": "The 'read' function reads the 'README.rst' file to obtain a long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The content from 'README.rst' is read and passed into the setup function as 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard setup tasks. The 'read' function does not sanitize or validate input files but reads a local file without user input.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging modules, defines a simple file reading function, and calls 'setup' with static package metadata. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The use of 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools' is noted but not suspicious; no obfuscation or malicious code indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
