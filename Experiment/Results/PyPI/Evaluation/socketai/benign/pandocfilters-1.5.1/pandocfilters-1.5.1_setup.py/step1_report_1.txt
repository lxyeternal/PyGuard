{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to configure the packaging and distribution of the 'pandocfilters' Python module using setuptools and distutils.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.rst' file to include a long description, and imports data from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file write, or command execution are present; the code only reads local files and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "The read() function loads content from 'README.rst', which is then used as the long_description in setup(). No untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses distutils.core.setup instead of the more modern setuptools.setup, which could be considered outdated but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for packaging, defines a function to read file contents, and calls setup() with metadata for packaging the 'pandocfilters' module. All operations are standard for Python package configuration. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of distutils instead of setuptools alone is not suspicious. No anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard package setup procedures without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical package configuration script with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
