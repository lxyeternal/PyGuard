  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing Pandoc AST in JSON format, including file management, JSON traversal, and filter application.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PANDOCFILTER_CLEANUP', content hashing for filenames, JSON AST data structures, user-defined actions during tree walk.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no external network activity, no data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Content is hashed to generate filenames; environment variable controls temp directory cleanup; JSON data flows through walk and filter functions; no external communication or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'PANDOCFILTER_CLEANUP' for temp directory management—standard pattern, not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module for Pandoc filters, with functions for filename generation, JSON tree traversal, and filter application. It employs environment variables for optional cleanup, hashes content for caching, and provides constructors for Pandoc elements. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication are present. The environment variable usage is typical for resource management and does not indicate sabotage. The code is clear, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The environment variable controls are standard and pose no security threat. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily related to resource management, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2). The assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code.",
