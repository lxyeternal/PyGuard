  "conclusion": "The script is a benign mathematical plotting code with a conceptual error in labeling polynomials. There is no malicious activity, data leakage, or security risk. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score should be slightly increased to 0.2 to reflect the potential for confusion or misinterpretation, but overall, the code is safe."
