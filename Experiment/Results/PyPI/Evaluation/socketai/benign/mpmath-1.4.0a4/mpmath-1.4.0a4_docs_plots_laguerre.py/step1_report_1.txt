{
  "purpose": "Define and plot Hermite polynomials using Laguerre functions for specific degrees.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses predefined functions and constants.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external locations, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code calls 'laguerre' functions, which are typically related to Laguerre polynomials, not Hermite polynomials, indicating a potential conceptual mismatch or mistake. The code also uses 'plot' without importing it, which may lead to runtime errors, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines lambda functions named as if they are Hermite polynomials, but internally they call 'laguerre' functions, indicating a possible conceptual error or mislabeling. There are no obvious malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network access, or system modifications. The absence of imports and the mismatch between the purpose and the function calls suggest the code may not execute as intended, but it does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be intended for plotting Hermite polynomials but incorrectly uses Laguerre functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is a conceptual or implementation mistake rather than malicious activity.",
