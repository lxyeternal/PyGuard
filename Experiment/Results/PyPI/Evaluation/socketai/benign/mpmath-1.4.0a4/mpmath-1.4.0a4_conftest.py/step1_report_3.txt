{
  "purpose": "The code configures and reports information related to the mpmath library and pytest testing framework.",
  "sources": "Reads environment and system information such as sys.version and mpmath backend/version; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code primarily sets configurations and prints info.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules. It defines functions for reporting pytest configuration details and resets mpmath global variables before tests. It uses standard practices for configuring pytest and setting mpmath parameters. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be part of a testing setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for configuring pytest and the mpmath library during testing. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
