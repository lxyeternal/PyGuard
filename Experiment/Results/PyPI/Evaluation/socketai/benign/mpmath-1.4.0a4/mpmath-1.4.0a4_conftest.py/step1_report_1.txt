{
  "purpose": "The code is intended for configuring and running pytest tests for the mpmath library, including reporting environment information and resetting global variables before each test.",
  "sources": "The code reads the sys.version string and the mpmath library's __version__, as well as global variables in mpmath (mp and iv).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects, such as network or filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "Inputs from sys.version and mpmath global variables are used for reporting and resetting states, with no data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code are present; the code performs standard testing setup and reporting functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and mpmath, sets ignore lists for pytest collection, and defines functions for reporting environment info and resetting mpmath globals. It uses standard practices for test configuration and fixture setup, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscated code. The code's purpose is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest configuration script for the mpmath library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
