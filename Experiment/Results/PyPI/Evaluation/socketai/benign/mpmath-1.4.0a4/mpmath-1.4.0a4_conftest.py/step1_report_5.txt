{
  "purpose": "The code is a test configuration script for the 'pytest' framework, used to set up test environment parameters and display information about the 'mpmath' library and Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (sys.version), imports modules (pytest, mpmath), and retrieves configuration variables from 'mpmath' (mp.dps, mp.pretty, iv.dps, iv.pretty).",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code reads system info and library variables but does not process untrusted inputs or data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs standard test setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, configures pytest test markers, and resets mpmath global variables before each test. It outputs version and configuration information for debugging purposes. No external data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The functions are straightforward, and the code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or cryptographic operations. Overall, it appears to be a benign test setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test configuration script for pytest and mpmath, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
