  "purpose": "Configure pytest environment, report environment info, and reset mpmath global variables for testing.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, pytest, mpmath; environment info functions; global variable resets.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file operations involving untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment info functions and global variable resets; no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward setup code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest configuration script for the mpmath library, performing environment reporting and resetting global variables. It contains no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code. All signals indicate benign, well-structured test setup code with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score of 0. The slight securityRisk=0.1 in report 5 is overly cautious; it should be 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
