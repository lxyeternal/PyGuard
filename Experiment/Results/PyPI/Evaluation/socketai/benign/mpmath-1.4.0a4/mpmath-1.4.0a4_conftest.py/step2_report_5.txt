  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports standard libraries (`os`, `sys`, `pytest`, `mpmath`)\n- Sets a collection ignore list for pytest\n- Defines a function to print environment info (`pytest_report_header`)\n- Defines a fixture to reset `mpmath` global variables before each test (`reset_mp_globals`)\n- No external data input, no network, no file operations, no eval/exec, no secrets or credentials.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code appears straightforward and benign. No malicious or suspicious code is present. It performs environment reporting and resets global variables for testing, which are standard practices.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No evident errors or flaws. The code is simple and correctly structured for its purpose.\n\n- **Scores given:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports — appropriate, as no malicious activity is present.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n  - **Security risk:** 0 or very close to 0 — no security risks.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0 or near-zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n  All reports are consistent, assigning low or zero scores.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a standard pytest setup script for a math library, with environment reporting and global state resetting.\n- No data leaks, no untrusted input processing, no network activity, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.\n- The purpose is typical for testing environments.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's purpose.",
