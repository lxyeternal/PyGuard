  "purpose": "This code sets up configuration and fixtures for pytest testing framework related to the mpmath library, including ignoring certain files, printing environment info, and resetting global variables.",
  "sources": "import os, sys, pytest, mpmath",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical actions",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; environment info is printed, and global variables are reset within the test framework",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard testing setup with no hardcoded credentials or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test configuration functions. It ignores certain files, prints environment information for debugging, and resets global variables in the mpmath library before tests. All operations are standard and do not involve untrusted input or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical test setup for a mathematical library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns.",
