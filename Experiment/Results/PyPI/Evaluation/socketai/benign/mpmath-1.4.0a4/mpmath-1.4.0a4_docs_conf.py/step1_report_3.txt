  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or risky data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code; straightforward configuration file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical setup for extensions, project info, and HTML/LaTeX output options. It imports a module for version info, but does not execute any untrusted or dynamic code. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or data processing that could be malicious are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration script for documentation generation. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
