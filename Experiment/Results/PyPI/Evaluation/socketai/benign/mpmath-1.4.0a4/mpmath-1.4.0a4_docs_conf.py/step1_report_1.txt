  "purpose": "Configuration for building the documentation of the mpmath Python package using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import of the mpmath module; execution of the script via execfile().",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or external connections.",
  "flows": "The script loads mpmath to obtain version info, then uses static configuration data for documentation generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The file contains only static configuration data and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the mpmath module solely to access version information and sets static configuration parameters for Sphinx documentation. There are no input sources, no data processing, or external network calls. The configuration is typical for a documentation build script, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The initial comments clarify that the script is pickled and that no unpickleable objects are used, which does not pose a security threat. The presence of only static data and harmless library imports indicates no malicious intent or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely contains static setup parameters and harmless imports, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
