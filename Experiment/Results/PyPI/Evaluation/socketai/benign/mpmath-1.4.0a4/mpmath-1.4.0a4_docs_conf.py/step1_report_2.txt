  "purpose": "Configuration for building documentation for the mpmath project using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports the mpmath module, which provides version information and other project details.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data influences execution or leaks data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the mpmath module solely for retrieving project metadata such as version and name. It sets various configuration options for Sphinx documentation generation, including extensions, project info, themes, and intersphinx links. No user input, network communication, or file system operations are present that could be exploited. The code appears to be a typical documentation build configuration with no malicious or suspicious code sections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages documentation settings and imports project metadata without any insecure or harmful operations.",
