{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple lambda functions to compute elliptic integrals F(z, m) for different values of parameter m and then plots these functions over specified ranges.",
  "sources": "The functions ellipf(z, m) are called with inputs z and m. The inputs z are parameters of the lambda functions, which are then used as arguments for ellipf.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data exfiltration. The plotting function may display data but does not transmit it externally.",
  "flows": "Input z values are fed into lambda functions, which call ellipf with fixed m values. The results are passed to a plotting function to generate visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses straightforward mathematical function definitions and plotting. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines lambda functions for elliptic integrals with different parameters and plots these functions over the specified range. All operations appear standard mathematical computations and visualization. No external data sources, network operations, or potentially malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic mathematical calculations and plotting without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a simple, legitimate mathematical visualization script with no malicious behavior.",
