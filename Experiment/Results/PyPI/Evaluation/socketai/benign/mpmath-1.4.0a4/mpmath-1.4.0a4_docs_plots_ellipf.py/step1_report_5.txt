  "purpose": "Define and plot elliptic integrals for different parameter values",
  "sources": "None explicitly; ellipf function is used, likely from a library or imported module (not shown in the snippet)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code defines functions and attempts to plot them, standard behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines five lambda functions computing elliptic integrals with different parameter values. It then calls a plot function with these functions and specified ranges. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The ellipf function's origin is unspecified, but using such mathematical functions in plotting is typical and benign. The code appears to be for mathematical visualization, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward mathematical plotting snippet without malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply defines functions for elliptic integrals and attempts to plot them. There are no indications of malware or security risks.",
