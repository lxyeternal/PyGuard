{
  "purpose": "Define multiple lambda functions for elliptic integral F(z,m) with different parameter m and plot their results over a specified range.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data or user input; it only defines functions and calls a plotting function.",
  "sinks": "The code calls a plotting function, which could display results, but no untrusted data is involved in this process.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; data is generated internally and visualized locally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The functions are simple wrappers around 'ellipf', which appears to be a mathematical function, likely from a mathematical library.",
  "analysis": "The code defines five lambda functions computing the elliptic integral F(z,m) with different 'm' values. It then plots these functions over the range [0, pi] with some y-axis limit. There are no external data inputs, no use of untrusted data, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be straightforward mathematical plotting. The functions 'ellipf' and 'plot' are assumed to be imported from relevant libraries, and there is no indication of malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, focusing on mathematical visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mathematical visualization script defining and plotting elliptic integral functions with different parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks.",
