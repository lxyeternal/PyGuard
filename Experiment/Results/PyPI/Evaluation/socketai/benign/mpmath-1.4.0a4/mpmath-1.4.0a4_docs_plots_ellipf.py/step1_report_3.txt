  "purpose": "Define and plot elliptic integrals with different parameter m values over a range of z from 0 to pi.",
  "sources": "Input range z from 0 to pi; function calls to ellipf with various m values.",
  "sinks": "Plot function which displays the elliptic integral functions over the specified range.",
  "flows": "z values fed into ellipf functions, then results passed to plot for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious or malicious commands, no data exfiltration, no external network activity or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several lambda functions computing elliptic integrals for different m parameters. It then plots these functions over the interval [0, pi]. All functions are standard mathematical computations, assuming ellipf is a legitimate mathematical function. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or code injection. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical plotting script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical plotting routine involving elliptic integrals. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply computes and plots mathematical functions.",
