  "purpose": "Define multiple elliptic integral functions with different parameters and plot them over a specified range for visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses predefined lambda functions calling 'ellipf' with fixed parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The lambda functions compute elliptic integrals, which are then plotted; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mathematical functions for elliptic integrals and plots them. It uses standard functions likely from scientific libraries. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is detected. The code appears to be a straightforward visualization script. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0) are consistent with the benign nature. Slightly elevated securityRisk scores (0.1) are unwarranted given the benign context; they should be adjusted to 0. The confidence in this assessment is high, as the code is simple and clearly intended for mathematical plotting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical visualization of elliptic integrals with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its benign nature. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 should be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
