{
  "purpose": "Define lambda functions for Hankel functions of orders 0 to 3 and plot them over a specified range.",
  "sources": "Lambda functions calling 'hankel1' with different order parameters, and the 'plot' function with a list of functions and axis ranges.",
  "sinks": "The 'plot' function may be a sink if it executes untrusted or malicious plotting commands or transmits data externally, but no such behavior is evident.",
  "flows": "Lambda functions receive input 'x', call 'hankel1' with specific order, then 'plot' renders these functions over specified axes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. Usage of 'hankel1' depends on context but appears to be a mathematical function call; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions for Hankel functions of orders 0 through 3. It then calls 'plot' with these functions and axis parameters. 'hankel1' is typically a mathematical function from SciPy or a similar library, used here for plotting mathematical functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or code obfuscation. The code is straightforward, focusing on mathematical plotting, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign mathematical plotting script that defines Hankel functions and visualizes them. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
