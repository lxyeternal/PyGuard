  "purpose": "Define lambda functions for Hankel functions H1_n(x) for n=0 to 3 and plot them over a specified range.",
  "sources": "The lambda functions use the 'hankel1' function, which is assumed to be imported from a scientific library such as scipy.special.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior, no data leaks or malicious actions are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input values are passed to the lambda functions which invoke 'hankel1' with different n values; the 'plot' function visualizes these functions over a fixed range.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for plotting special functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions representing Hankel functions of the first kind for orders 0 through 3. It then attempts to plot these functions over the x-range [0,6] and y-range [-2,1]. The only external dependency is 'hankel1', likely from scipy.special, which is standard in scientific Python programming. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. No inputs from untrusted sources are processed, and no data exfiltration or system modification occurs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward mathematical plotting of Hankel functions with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a normal scientific or educational script.",
