{
  "purpose": "Define lambda functions for Hankel functions of orders 0 to 3 and plot them over a specified range.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data read; reliance on external 'hankel1' function which is likely imported from a library.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; plotting functions display the data but do not send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input to 'hankel1' functions -> lambda functions -> plot function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Usage of mathematical functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions for Hankel functions of different orders, likely from a math library. It then attempts to plot these functions over a specified domain. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, system commands, or backdoors. The code is straightforward mathematical plotting code with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mathematical plotting routine for Hankel functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be standard scientific computing code.",
