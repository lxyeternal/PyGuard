  "purpose": "Define and plot Hankel functions of order 0 to 3 on a given range",
  "sources": "Assignment of lambda functions using hankel1 for each order",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or output data in a dangerous manner",
  "flows": "The code assigns functions to variables and then calls a plot function with these functions and specific range parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious operations detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions representing Hankel functions of orders 0 to 3, using the 'hankel1' function. It then calls a 'plot' function with these functions and specific plotting ranges. The code appears to be straightforward mathematical plotting code without any signs of malicious behavior or suspicious data handling. No external data inputs, no network activity, and no insecure operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple mathematical plotting script that defines Hankel functions and plots them. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
