  "purpose": "Define and plot Hankel functions H1_n(x) for n=0,1,2,3 over specified ranges.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and does not contain unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The use of lambda functions for mathematical functions is normal. The 'plot' function suggests visualization but no external data or user input is involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions computing the Hankel functions of the first kind for orders 0 to 3. It then attempts to plot these functions over specified ranges. There is no indication of malicious activity such as network communication, file access, or data exfiltration. The code is a simple mathematical plotting routine with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard mathematical plotting script defining Hankel functions and plotting them. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present. It appears to be a benign computational visualization.",
