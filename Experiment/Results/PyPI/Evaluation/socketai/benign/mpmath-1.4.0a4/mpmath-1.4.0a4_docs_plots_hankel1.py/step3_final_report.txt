{
  "purpose": "Define Hankel functions of orders 0 to 3 and plot them over specified ranges.",
  "sources": "The functions `hankel1(n, x)` and `plot()` are called; likely sourced from scientific libraries such as `scipy.special` and `matplotlib.pyplot`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameter `x` flows into `hankel1` functions; results are passed to `plot()` for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward mathematical function definitions and plotting routines with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions computing Hankel functions of the first kind for orders 0 through 3, then plots these functions over the ranges [0,6] for x and [-2,1] for y. It involves no external data input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The functions are standard in scientific computing, and the plotting is routine. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and justified based on the code's benign, mathematical nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific plotting routine for Hankel functions with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
