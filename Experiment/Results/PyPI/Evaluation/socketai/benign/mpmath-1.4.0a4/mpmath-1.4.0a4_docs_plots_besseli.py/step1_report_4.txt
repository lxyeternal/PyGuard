{
  "purpose": "Define modified Bessel functions for n=0,1,2,3 and plot them over the interval [0,5].",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'x' parameter in lambda functions, and the 'plot' function call.",
  "sinks": "The 'plot' function, which could potentially send data to an external display or environment.",
  "flows": "Lambda functions receive 'x' as input; the 'plot' function uses these lambda functions as data sources; data flows from the lambdas into the plot.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. The code relies on 'besseli' and 'plot' functions, which are standard mathematical and plotting functions, assuming proper context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions representing the modified Bessel function I_n(x) for n=0 to 3, using the 'besseli' function. It then calls 'plot' with these functions and fixed x-range [0,5]. There is no indication of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be straightforward mathematical plotting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code calculates and plots modified Bessel functions for n=0 to 3 over [0,5]. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues. It appears to be a simple mathematical plotting script with standard library functions.",
