{
  "purpose": "Define modified Bessel functions for n=0,1,2,3 and plot them.",
  "sources": "The lambda functions call the besseli function with specific parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct untrusted data sinks such as file writes, network connections, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The functions are defined and then passed to a plotting function; no data flow from external input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code appears straightforward and mathematically focused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions calculating the modified Bessel function of the first kind for different orders. It then attempts to plot these functions over a range. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of besseli is standard mathematical functionality, assuming it is imported properly. The plotting line is vague as it uses 'plot' without context or import statements, but this does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple mathematical plotting script defining and plotting Bessel functions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the absence of import statements for besseli and plot, but these are not malicious.",
