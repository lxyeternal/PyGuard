  "purpose": "Define and plot modified Bessel functions I_n(x) for n=0,1,2,3 over a range from 0 to 5.",
  "sources": "Lambda functions calling besseli(0,x), besseli(1,x), besseli(2,x), besseli(3,x); the plot function that visualizes these functions.",
  "sinks": "The plot function may be a sink that displays or saves data; besseli functions process inputs and generate outputs but do not have side effects.",
  "flows": "Input values (x in [0,5]) flow into the lambda functions, which compute Bessel functions, then these results flow into the plot for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions for mathematical functions is typical; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions computing modified Bessel functions of the first kind for orders 0 through 3 using besseli. It then attempts to plot these functions over the range [0,5]. The use of lambda functions for mathematical computation is normal, and the plotting command suggests visualization intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation, is evident. The code is concise and appears to serve a scientific or educational purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for defining and plotting mathematical functions related to Bessel functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, educational, or analytical snippet.",
