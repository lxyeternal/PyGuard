  "purpose": "Define lambda functions for modified Bessel functions I_n(x) for n=0..3 and plot them over the range [0,5].",
  "sources": "Lambda functions calling besseli(0,x), besseli(1,x), besseli(2,x), besseli(3,x); plot function with these functions and range parameters.",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions, which visualize the computed Bessel functions.",
  "flows": "Input variable x flows into each lambda function, which calls besseli, then the results are passed to plot for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of import statements for besseli and plot functions; code relies on assumed external libraries without explicit imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mathematical functions for Bessel functions and plots them, serving as a visualization. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The only technical flaw is missing import statements, which would prevent execution but do not imply security issues. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to incomplete snippet but not security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for mathematical visualization of Bessel functions, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The minor technical issue of missing imports does not elevate the security risk. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
