  "purpose": "Define modified Bessel functions I_n(x) for n=0,1,2,3 and plot them over the range 0 to 5.",
  "sources": "Input parameter x in the lambda functions for besseli calls; data passed to the plot function.",
  "sinks": "Plot function rendering the functions over specified ranges; no untrusted data is processed in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "Input x -> lambda functions -> besseli -> plot outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code constructs. The code uses lambda functions to define Bessel functions and plots them; standard mathematical functions without obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four lambda functions corresponding to modified Bessel functions for different orders. It then plots these functions over the interval [0, 5]. The functions are standard mathematical functions from scipy.special (assumed). There are no inputs from external untrusted sources; the code solely defines and visualizes mathematical functions. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of lambda functions and plotting is typical for mathematical visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign mathematical visualization script defining and plotting Bessel functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward, safe implementation intended for mathematical analysis or visualization.",
