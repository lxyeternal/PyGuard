  "purpose": "Define functions for modified Bessel functions of orders 0 to 3 and plot them.",
  "sources": "Function definitions for besseli(0,x), besseli(1,x), besseli(2,x), besseli(3,x); usage of plot function.",
  "sinks": "The plot function which visualizes the Bessel functions.",
  "flows": "Input x values are passed to besseli functions, and the outputs are plotted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Usage of mathematical functions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines lambda functions for Bessel functions of specific orders using besseli, a typical mathematical library function. It then calls plot with a list of these functions and ranges [0,5] for both axes. The code seems straightforward, intended for visualization, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data flow. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data leaks, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs mathematical function definitions and plotting for standard Bessel functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a benign mathematical visualization script.",
