  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scoring and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the Original Code:**\n```python\nplot([lambertw, lambda x: lambertw(x, -1)], [-2, 2], [-5, 2], points=2000)\n```\n- Calls `lambertw` twice: once for the principal branch, once for branch -1.\n- Plots over specified ranges.\n- No external inputs, no system commands, no data leaks.\n- Presumably uses a scientific library (e.g., SciPy) for `lambertw`.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Plot Lambert W branches over ranges.  \n- Analysis: No external inputs, no suspicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, standard mathematical plotting.  \n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the straightforward nature.  \n- No suspicious activity, no external data, no malicious intent.  \n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Similar again, confirms no external input or malicious behavior.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.  \n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Mentions the use of `lambertw` without import statements—this is a valid point.  \n- Notes the function is from scientific libraries, but the code snippet is incomplete.  \n- Security risk is marked as 0.1, possibly due to missing context or dependency issues.  \n- No malware or obfuscation.  \n**Assessment:** The point about missing import statements is valid, but it doesn't introduce security risk. The low securityRisk score is reasonable.  \n**Overall:** No malicious concern, just incomplete code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar to others, confirms straightforward plotting.  \n- No external data, no suspicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the Scores and Logic\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor concern is the missing import statement for `lambertw`, which is acknowledged in Report 4, but this isn't a security issue—just incomplete code.\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 or very close to it; minor mention in Report 4 about missing imports, but not a security concern.\n- **Confidence:** High (1 or 0.9), consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment**\n\n- The code is a straightforward plotting of mathematical functions using `lambertw`.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The only technical note is the missing import statement for `lambertw`, which is a coding completeness issue, not a security concern.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malware signatures or malicious intent detected.  \n- No obfuscation present.  \n- No security risks involved in the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:**  \nEnsure that in the actual implementation, `lambertw` is properly imported from a trusted scientific library (e.g., `from scipy.special import lambertw`) to avoid runtime errors, but this does not affect security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and safe for mathematical visualization. The scores should reflect no security concern or malicious intent.",
