{
  "purpose": "Plotting branches 0 and -1 of the Lambert W function over specified ranges.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the range values [-2, 2] for x and [-5, 2] for y; usage of lambertw function as input.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; plotting output is visual and does not involve untrusted data transmission or storage.",
  "flows": "Input ranges are used to compute lambertw for plotting; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of lambertw function is standard for mathematical plotting; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code calls the lambertw function twice to plot its principal and -1 branches over specified ranges. It involves standard mathematical plotting without reading external inputs, executing untrusted code, or performing any system modifications. There are no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical visualization.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard plotting of the Lambert W function branches with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical for mathematical visualization tasks.",
