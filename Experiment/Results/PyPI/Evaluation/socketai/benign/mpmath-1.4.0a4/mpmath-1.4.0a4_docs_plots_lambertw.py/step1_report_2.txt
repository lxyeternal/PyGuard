  "purpose": "Plotting branches 0 and -1 of the Lambert W function over specified ranges.",
  "sources": "User input for plotting range and points, and function definitions for lambertw",
  "sinks": "Plotting function that renders visual output; no data leakage or external data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Input data (ranges and points) -> Lambert W function computations -> Plot rendering",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behaviors, no obfuscated code, no malicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code calls the lambertw function twice with different parameters to plot two branches over specified ranges, then visualizes the results. The lambertw function is a mathematical function, likely imported from a mathematical library. The plotting code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or malicious network activity. No suspicious variables, no code injection, and no unusual control flows are present. The code's purpose seems purely mathematical and visualization-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign plotting of Lambert W function branches without any malicious intent. It uses standard mathematical functions and plotting routines without suspicious behaviors or security risks.",
