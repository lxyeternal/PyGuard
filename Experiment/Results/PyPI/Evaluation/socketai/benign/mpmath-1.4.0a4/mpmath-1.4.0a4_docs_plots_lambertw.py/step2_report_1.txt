  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully and compare them with the original code snippet.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nplot([lambertw, lambda x: lambertw(x, -1)], [-2, 2], [-5, 2], points=2000)\n```\n- Calls `lambertw` twice: once for the principal branch and once for branch -1.\n- Plots over specified ranges.\n- No external input, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- Presumably relies on a mathematical library (e.g., SciPy).\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues in the Code:\n- The code itself is straightforward: plotting mathematical functions.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or external data handling.\n- The only potential concern is whether `lambertw` is imported correctly, but this is outside the scope of the report.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues are present in the code as provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for plotting.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external data sources.\n- Some mention the missing import of `lambertw`, which is a valid point but not a security concern per se.\n- Slight variation in confidence levels; some mention a minor security risk due to missing context, but overall, they conclude safety.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Scores and Reasoning:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports give 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report mentioning a small 0.1 risk due to missing context. Given the code's simplicity, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The report with `securityRisk: 0.1` (Report 4) suggests a minor concern about missing imports or context, but this is not a security vulnerability.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard mathematical plotting snippet.\n- No external inputs, no data leaks, no malicious logic.\n- The only minor concern is the missing import statement for `lambertw`, but that is not a security issue.\n- Therefore, **malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be 0**.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus that the code is benign and intended for mathematical visualization.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent in identifying the code as benign. Minor concerns about missing context are not security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I agree with them.",
