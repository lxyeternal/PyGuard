{
  "purpose": "The code aims to plot the branches 0 and -1 of the Lambert W function over specified ranges.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it appears to use internal functions and parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leakage or security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code directly calls mathematical functions with fixed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses the Lambert W function with different branches, which is legitimate mathematical usage, but it does not import or define the Lambert W function; this could suggest missing context or dependencies. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to plot two branches of the Lambert W function over a specified range. It uses the 'lambertw' function, which is typically part of scientific computing libraries such as SciPy. However, there are no import statements shown, so if the library is not imported elsewhere, this would cause a runtime error. The plotting function is called with specific range parameters. No external input, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The code does not contain any malware signatures, obfuscated code, or malicious intent based on the visible fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward plotting of mathematical functions without any malicious behavior. It appears to be a snippet meant for visualization purposes. The absence of import statements or context makes it incomplete, but there are no security concerns or malicious signs identified.",
