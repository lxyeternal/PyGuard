  "purpose": "Plotting the Lambert W function branches 0 and -1 over specified ranges for visualization.",
  "sources": "Calls to lambertw function, plotting parameters, and range definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input ranges and lambertw function calls used directly in plotting; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Missing import statement for lambertw, which could cause runtime errors but not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward plotting of mathematical functions using lambertw, with no malicious logic, data leaks, or obfuscation. The only concern is the absence of an import statement for lambertw, which is a code completeness issue but not a security vulnerability. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code relies on standard scientific libraries, and the operations are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for mathematical visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The missing import statement is a minor technical oversight but does not impact security. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
