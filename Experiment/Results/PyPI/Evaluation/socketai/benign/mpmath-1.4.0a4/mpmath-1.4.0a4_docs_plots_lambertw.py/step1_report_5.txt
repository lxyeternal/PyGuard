{
  "purpose": "Plotting branches 0 and -1 of the Lambert W function over specified ranges",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded ranges for plotting, and functions lambertw and lambda x: lambertw(x, -1)",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or outputting data to external sources",
  "flows": "The code uses lambertw to generate data points for plotting, with no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears straightforward and typical for plotting mathematical functions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plot for Lambert W function branches 0 and -1 over specific intervals with 2000 points. It calls lambertw directly, which is a known mathematical function. No user input, environment variables, or external data is involved. There is no indication of malicious behavior or malicious side effects. The code appears to be for visualization purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a mathematical plot of Lambert W function branches without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not process untrusted input or perform any risky operations.",
