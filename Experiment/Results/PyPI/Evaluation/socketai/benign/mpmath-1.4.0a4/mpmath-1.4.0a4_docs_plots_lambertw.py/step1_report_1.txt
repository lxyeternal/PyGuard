{
  "purpose": "Plotting the branches 0 and -1 of the Lambert W function over specified ranges.",
  "sources": "Function calls to lambertw, and the parameters provided to plot (input range, points).",
  "sinks": "None observed that lead to data leak, system command execution, or other security effects.",
  "flows": "Input ranges and functions flow into the plotting function, but there are no untrusted data sources or outputs that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution detected. Usage of lambertw function appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a plot of the Lambert W function for two branches over specified x and y ranges with 2000 points. No external inputs, environment variables, or network communications are involved. The functions used are mathematical functions from a numerical library, and the plotting appears straightforward. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code is simple and standard for mathematical plotting tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign plotting of mathematical functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard usage of mathematical functions for visualization purposes.",
