  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scoring and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The original code is a straightforward plotting of the Lambert W function branches 0 and -1 over specified ranges.\n- It uses the `lambertw` function twice with different parameters, then plots the results.\n- No external inputs, user data, or network activity are involved.\n- The code appears to be for mathematical visualization.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; plots Lambert W branches.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; benign, standard mathematical plotting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate and well justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; benign visualization.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; mentions specific ranges.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Slightly less confidence but still appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; notes missing import of `lambertw`.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights a potential runtime error if `lambertw` isn't imported, but no malicious intent.\n- **Security Risk:** Noted as 0.1 due to incomplete context.\n\n**Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.7.\n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score is slightly elevated due to missing context (no import statement). Since the code itself isn't malicious, but incomplete, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; straightforward plotting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The original code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Security Risk:** Most reports assign zero; Report 4 assigns 0.1 due to missing import context, which is reasonable.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n- The code relies on `lambertw`, which is typically from `scipy.special`. The absence of an import statement is a minor oversight but not malicious.\n- The code is purely mathematical and visualization-oriented.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks; the only concern is missing context (import), which is not a security issue.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated scores** should remain at zero, and **Risk score** should stay at zero unless external factors suggest otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign mathematical plotting script.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Minor context issues (missing import) do not impact security assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at zero for malware and obfuscation, and zero for risk, with a note that the code is safe and typical for scientific visualization.",
