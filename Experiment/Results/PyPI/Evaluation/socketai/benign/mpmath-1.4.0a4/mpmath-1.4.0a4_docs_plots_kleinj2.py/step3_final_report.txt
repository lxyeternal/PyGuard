  "purpose": "Plotting the Klein J-function over specified ranges using a high-resolution plot.",
  "sources": "The lambda function calling fp.kleinj(tau=t) for each t in the range [-1, 2].",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely mathematical computation and visualization.",
  "flows": "Input range t -> fp.kleinj(t) -> fp.cplot visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward visualization of a mathematical function using a lambda to evaluate fp.kleinj over a specified range, plotted with high resolution. No malicious activity, network operations, or data leaks are present. The function calls are standard, and the code is clear and well-structured. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though risk could be slightly lowered to 0 given the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical plotting routine with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. Minor adjustments to risk scores to zero are recommended for precision.",
