{
  "purpose": "Define several lambda functions for irregular Coulomb wave functions and plot them.",
  "sources": "Variables 'F1', 'F2', 'F3', 'F4', 'F5' assigned lambda functions; function 'coulombg' called within lambdas; 'plot' function called at the end.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks or network communications.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' flows into 'coulombg' functions within lambdas, then results are passed to 'plot' for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a potential typo in 'F5' lambda: 'coulombg(0,x/2,x)' has an extra argument 'x' which may be a mistake; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines five lambda functions representing Coulomb functions with different parameters. The functions rely on an external 'coulombg' function. The final line attempts to plot these functions over specified ranges. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. The only notable issue is a likely typo in 'F5', which could cause runtime errors but not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard mathematical plotting of Coulomb wave functions with no malicious intent. The only concern is a probable typo in 'F5' which could lead to errors but not security issues.",
