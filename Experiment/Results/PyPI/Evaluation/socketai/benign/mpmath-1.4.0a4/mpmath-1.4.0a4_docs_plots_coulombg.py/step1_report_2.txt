{
  "purpose": "Define and plot irregular Coulomb wave functions using a lambda wrapper around a function named 'coulombg'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'coulombg' function calls, which may involve input parameters, and the 'plot' function for visualization.",
  "sinks": "The 'plot' function potentially outputs visual data; 'coulombg' could process or display data if it involves external communication or file access.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to 'coulombg' via lambda functions, then the results are plotted. No external data flow is evident beyond function calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambdas is straightforward; no signs of obfuscation or suspicious code structures; 'coulombg' is undefined in this snippet, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple lambda functions wrapping 'coulombg' with different parameters, likely for plotting Coulomb functions. No input validation, environment variable usage, or external connections are present. The 'coulombg' function's implementation is unknown; it could be benign or malicious, but from this code alone, there's no evident malicious behavior. The 'plot' function's origin and behavior are also not specified, but plotting data is typical for scientific code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward scientific plotting snippet defining and plotting Coulomb wave functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The overall security risk is low.",
