{
  "purpose": "Define several lambda functions related to Coulomb wave functions and plot them.",
  "sources": "Input: none explicitly; reliance on the 'coulombg' function, which is assumed to be imported or defined elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the 'plot' function which may display data; no direct untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flow is limited; 'x' is used internally, with no external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The 'coulombg' function is called but not defined or imported within this snippet, indicating missing context. The lambda functions are straightforward, but the use of 'coulombg' could be suspicious if sourced from untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple lambda functions that depend on 'coulombg', suggesting calculations of Coulomb wave functions. It then calls 'plot' with these functions and specified ranges. No user input, environment variables, or external data is directly handled. The presence of 'coulombg' without an import or definition might indicate incomplete code or reliance on external sources, but does not inherently imply malicious behavior. The overall structure appears to be scientific plotting, not malicious. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward scientific plotting snippet calculating Coulomb wave functions. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The only notable point is the missing definition of 'coulombg', which suggests incomplete code rather than malicious behavior.",
