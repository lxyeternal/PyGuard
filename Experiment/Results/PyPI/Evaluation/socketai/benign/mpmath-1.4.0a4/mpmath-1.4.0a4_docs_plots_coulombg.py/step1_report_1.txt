{
  "purpose": "Define and plot irregular Coulomb wave functions using a lambda wrapper around the 'coulombg' function.",
  "sources": "Reading or receiving input data from the 'x' parameter within the lambda functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially passing untrusted data into 'coulombg' function, which could execute arbitrary code if 'coulombg' is malicious or insecure.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' is processed by lambda functions which call 'coulombg' with specific parameters, then the functions are plotted.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated constructs. The function 'coulombg' is not defined within this snippet, but its usage appears standard; no malicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines five lambda functions that wrap the 'coulombg' function with fixed parameters and varying input 'x'. It then attempts to plot these functions over specified ranges. No user input, network calls, or suspicious code structures are present. The reliance on an external function 'coulombg' is noted, but without its implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code appears to generate plots for scientific purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining functions for plotting Coulomb wave functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up functions and plots them, likely for scientific visualization.",
