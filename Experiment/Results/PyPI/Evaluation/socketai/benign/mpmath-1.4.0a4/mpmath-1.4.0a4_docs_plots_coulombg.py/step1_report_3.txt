  "purpose": "Define and plot irregular Coulomb wave functions using a lambda that calls 'coulombg' with different parameters.",
  "sources": "The lambda functions (F1 to F5) that call 'coulombg' with various arguments.",
  "sinks": "The plot function that visualizes the functions; no untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The lambda functions generate data by calling 'coulombg', then data is passed to 'plot'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior. The function 'coulombg' is invoked but not defined in this snippet; assuming it is imported or defined elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple lambda functions calling 'coulombg' with different parameters, which appear to represent mathematical functions. These functions are then plotted over specified ranges. There is no indication of malicious intent, no network activity, no data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The primary concern is the undefined 'coulombg', which might be from an external library. However, nothing suspicious or malicious is evident from the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical plotting of Coulomb wave functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present. The only minor concern is the undefined 'coulombg', but this is likely a dependency or imported function, not malicious. Overall, the code seems benign.",
