{
  "purpose": "Define multiple Coulomb wave functions with varying parameters and plot them for analysis.",
  "sources": "External function 'coulombg' (assumed imported or defined elsewhere), input parameter 'x' for lambda functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data leakage or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' flows into each lambda function, which calls 'coulombg' with specific parameters; results are plotted.",
  "anomalies": "The lambda 'F5' calls 'coulombg' with three arguments ('0, x/2, x') whereas others use two, indicating a potential typo or inconsistency. 'coulombg' is undefined within the snippet, which could cause runtime errors but not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code defines lambda functions wrapping an external 'coulombg' function, then plots these functions over a range. The main concern is the inconsistent number of arguments in 'F5', which may be a typo. The function 'coulombg' is not defined in the snippet, suggesting dependency on external code. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code appears to serve scientific visualization purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the context, with the minor risk stemming from reliance on an external, undefined function and a potential typo.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for scientific plotting of Coulomb functions. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only issues are the undefined 'coulombg' function and a probable typo in 'F5', which do not imply malicious intent but should be corrected for runtime correctness.",
