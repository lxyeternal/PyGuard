  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a Django decorator implementing rate limiting via django_ratelimit.\n- The code dynamically imports an exception class from settings, which is a flexible pattern but could be misused if misconfigured.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code relies on external, well-established libraries and Django best practices.\n- No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or data leaks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Accurate; describes the flow correctly.\n- **Anomalies:** No issues.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n  \n**Assessment:** The scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No issues.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.2 is justified, considering the dynamic import could be misused if misconfigured, but this is a common pattern. The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No issues.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all cases, correctly.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0.1, at 0.2, justified by the dynamic import of exception classes, which could be misused if misconfigured, but is standard practice.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable, given the dynamic import pattern, but warrants caution if misconfigured.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, standard, and well-implemented. The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the code's security posture appropriately.",
