  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe, and well-implemented rate-limiting decorator with configurable exception handling. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The dynamic import pattern is common in Django for extensibility but should be managed carefully in configuration. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."
