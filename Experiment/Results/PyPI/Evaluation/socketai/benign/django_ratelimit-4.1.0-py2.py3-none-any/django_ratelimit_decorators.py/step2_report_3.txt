  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a standard rate-limiting decorator with no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and uses dynamic import for exception class which is common practice.\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description; it checks rate limits, raises exceptions if needed, and uses import_string for dynamic class import.\n- **Malware & obfuscated:** Both are correctly scored as 0.\n- **Security risk:** Score 0 is appropriate, as no vulnerabilities are identified.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified by clear, straightforward code.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing correct implementation, no malicious intent, and standard patterns.\n- **Code confirmation:** Consistent with the code provided.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2 (slightly cautious due to dynamic import, but acceptable).\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, confirming proper implementation, no malicious behavior, standard dynamic import.\n- **Code confirmation:** Matches the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2, confidence 0.95.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, consistent with previous reports; standard use of django_ratelimit, dynamic import for exception class, no suspicious activity.\n- **Code confirmation:** Confirmed.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; standard pattern, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Code confirmation:** Matches.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly cautious (0.2) due to the use of dynamic import (`import_string`) which could be misused if misconfigured, but this is a common pattern in Django for extensibility and not inherently risky.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned across all reports are consistent with the code and its analysis.\n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.\n- The use of dynamic import is standard but warrants cautious configuration to prevent misbehavior, which justifies a low security risk score.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to dynamic import, but standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's behavior.
