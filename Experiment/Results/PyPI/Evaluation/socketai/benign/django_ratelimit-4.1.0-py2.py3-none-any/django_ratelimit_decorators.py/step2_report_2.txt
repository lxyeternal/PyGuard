  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it defines a rate-limiting decorator for Django views, using django_ratelimit, with dynamic exception class import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or flaws identified. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk is 0, consistent with the report.  \n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, and no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.  \n- **Overall:** The report is accurate; the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it implements rate limiting with dynamic exception class import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or suspicious points noted.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, matching the analysis. Security risk is 0.2, which is slightly cautious but reasonable given the dynamic import.  \n- **Justification:** The dynamic import could, in theory, be misused if misconfigured, but in standard use, it is safe.  \n- **Overall:** The report's assessment is reasonable; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code aligns with the description; it’s a rate-limiting decorator with dynamic exception import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious or malicious patterns observed.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, consistent. Security risk is 0.2, which is acceptable considering the dynamic import.  \n- **Justification:** The dynamic import can be misconfigured but is standard practice for flexibility.  \n- **Overall:** The report is accurate; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches; it’s a Django rate-limiting decorator with dynamic exception class import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues or suspicious code patterns identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Justification:** The dynamic import is a common pattern; potential risks are minimal if configured correctly.  \n- **Overall:** The report correctly states the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is as described; rate limiting with dynamic exception class import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.2, which is reasonable.  \n- **Justification:** Same as above; the dynamic import is flexible but not malicious in standard use.  \n- **Overall:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the use of dynamic import for exception classes, a slight security risk (0.2) is justified, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to dynamic import, but standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Django rate-limiting decorator with configurable exception handling. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.",
