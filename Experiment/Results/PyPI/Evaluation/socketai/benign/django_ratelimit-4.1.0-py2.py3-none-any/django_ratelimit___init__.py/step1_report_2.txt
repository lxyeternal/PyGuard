  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward version info and constant definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple and creates a version string. It also sets sentinel values and lists of unsafe HTTP methods. There are no inputs, external data handling, or risky operations. The code appears to serve configuration or metadata purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for defining version and HTTP method constants with no malicious or security concerns detected.",
