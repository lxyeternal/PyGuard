  "purpose": "Define the version of the software and specify HTTP methods, including unsafe ones.",
  "sources": "Assignment of VERSION tuple and creation of __version__; assignment of ALL and UNSAFE lists.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data input or output operations involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple and converts it into a string for versioning purposes. It also sets a sentinel value ALL for HTTP methods and lists unsafe HTTP methods in UNSAFE. There are no inputs, external data sources, or sensitive operations. The code appears straightforward and benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It solely manages version information and HTTP method categorization.",
