  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code activities detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version tuple and joins it into a string, which is a standard practice for version management. It also defines sentinel and unsafe HTTP methods lists. There is no input handling, no data processing from external sources, and no risky operations such as network calls, file operations, or credential handling. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a configuration or metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and safe, with no malicious intent or security risks. It only defines constants related to versioning and HTTP methods.",
