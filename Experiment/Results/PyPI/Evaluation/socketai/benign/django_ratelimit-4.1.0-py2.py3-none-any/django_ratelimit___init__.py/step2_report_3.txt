  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward, defining version info and HTTP method constants.\n- No external data, input handling, or dynamic operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Issue presence:**  \n   The code snippets do not contain any malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities. They are simple constant definitions.  \n   **Confirmed:** No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.  \n   **No errors found.**\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - Malware: 0 — justified, as no malicious activity is present.  \n   - Obfuscated: 0 — justified, code is straightforward.  \n   - Security risk: 0 — justified, no vulnerabilities or risky operations.  \n   These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign scores above 0.5, and given the benign nature, this is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   Since the code only defines constants, there's no malware activity. The scores reflect this correctly.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and do not assume vulnerabilities where none exist. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard configuration snippet with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
