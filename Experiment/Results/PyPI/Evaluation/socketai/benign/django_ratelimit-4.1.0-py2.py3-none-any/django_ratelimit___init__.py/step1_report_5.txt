{
  "purpose": "Define the package version and specify HTTP methods for the module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded tuple for version, hardcoded list for unsafe HTTP methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or security impact.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sensitive sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sentinel value 'ALL' as a tuple with None; no actual malicious indicators or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes version information dynamically by joining a tuple of integers. It also defines a constant ALL as a sentinel value for 'all' HTTP methods and a list UNSAFE with typical unsafe HTTP verbs. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module defining version and HTTP method constants with no malicious intent or security issues.",
