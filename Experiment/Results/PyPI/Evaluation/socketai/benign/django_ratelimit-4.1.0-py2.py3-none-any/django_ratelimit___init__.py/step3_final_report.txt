  "purpose": "Define version information and categorize HTTP methods for a web application or library configuration.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments: VERSION tuple, __version__ string, ALL tuple, UNSAFE list.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version info and categorizes HTTP methods using static variables. It contains no input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The absence of data flows, secrets, or obfuscation indicates a benign configuration snippet. All reports correctly identify its simplicity and benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
