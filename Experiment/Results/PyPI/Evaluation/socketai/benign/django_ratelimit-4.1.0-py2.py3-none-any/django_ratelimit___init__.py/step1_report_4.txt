  "sinks": "No sinks involved; code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, defining constants.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version tuple, converts it to a string, and defines some constant tuples for HTTP methods. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration snippet defining version info and HTTP method categories with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
