  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from Django's `PermissionDenied`.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output operations, or any runtime logic.\n   - The class is purely a custom exception placeholder, likely used elsewhere in the application.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code does not contain any errors, flaws, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n   - No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n   - Confidence is high (1.0), as the analysis is consistent and accurate.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly marked as 0.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Since the class is just a subclass with no additional logic, it cannot be malicious.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, no modifications to the scores or analysis are warranted. It is a straightforward, harmless class definition serving as a custom exception in a Django application.\n\n**Summary**: The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores reflect this correctly.",
