  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class Ratelimited that inherits from Django's PermissionDenied exception.",
  "sources": "Import statement from django.core.exceptions",
  "sinks": "Class definition and inheritance from PermissionDenied",
  "flows": "Import used to access PermissionDenied; class Ratelimited extends PermissionDenied",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns; simple class inheritance",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard Django exception class and defines a subclass Ratelimited with no additional behavior. It appears to be intended for use as a custom exception for rate-limiting scenarios, but the class itself does not contain any malicious code or suspicious patterns. There are no external data sources, no untrusted input handling, and no malicious behaviors such as network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of a custom exception class inheriting from a standard Django permission exception. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious intent, or security risks. The purpose seems to be to provide a specific exception for rate-limiting logic.",
