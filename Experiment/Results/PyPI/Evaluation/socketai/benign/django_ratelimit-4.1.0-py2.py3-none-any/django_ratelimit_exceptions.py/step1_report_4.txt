{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'Ratelimited' inheriting from Django's 'PermissionDenied' for handling rate limiting scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares a class without any data processing or flow control.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard Django exception and creates a subclass for potential use elsewhere in a project. It does not perform any data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The class is empty and acts solely as a custom exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward class definition for a custom permission exception with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
