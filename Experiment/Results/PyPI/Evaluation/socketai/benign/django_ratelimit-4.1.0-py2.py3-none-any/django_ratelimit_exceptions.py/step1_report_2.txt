  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'Ratelimited' inheriting from Django's 'PermissionDenied' to handle rate limiting scenarios in a Django application.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling occur in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or input processing; class definition without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class inheritance with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a subclass of 'PermissionDenied' with no additional logic or code execution. It does not include any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The class is likely used elsewhere to raise rate-limiting permission errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a custom exception for rate limiting purposes in Django.",
