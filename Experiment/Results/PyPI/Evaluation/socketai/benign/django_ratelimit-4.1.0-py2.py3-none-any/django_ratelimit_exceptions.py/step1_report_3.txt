  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class Ratelimited that inherits from Django's PermissionDenied for handling rate-limiting related permission errors.",
  "sources": "The code imports PermissionDenied from django.core.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines a class, no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines a class inheriting from an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard Django exception and creates a subclass with no additional logic. There are no input sources, no untrusted data handling, no sinks, or flows. The class appears to be a simple custom exception for rate-limiting scenarios. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of a custom exception class for rate-limiting, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
