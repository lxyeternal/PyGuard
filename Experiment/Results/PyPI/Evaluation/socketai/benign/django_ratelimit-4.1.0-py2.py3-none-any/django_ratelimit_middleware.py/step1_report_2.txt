  "purpose": "Middleware to handle rate limiting exceptions and invoke a specified view upon such exceptions.",
  "sources": "Reads the RATELIMIT_VIEW setting from Django settings, and processes the exception object.",
  "sinks": "Calls a dynamically imported view function with request and exception objects.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> process_exception method checks type -> imports view via import_string -> calls view with request and exception.",
  "anomalies": "Uses import_string to dynamically import a view based on configuration, which could be manipulated if settings.RATELIMIT_VIEW is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware class that handles rate limiting exceptions from django_ratelimit. It imports a view dynamically via import_string based on a setting, which could potentially be exploited if that setting is maliciously altered. No other suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets are present. The dynamic import could be a vector if settings are not securely managed but is standard practice in Django for pluggable views.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward middleware for exception handling, with potential risk if settings.RATELIMIT_VIEW is compromised. There are no clear signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior within this snippet.",
