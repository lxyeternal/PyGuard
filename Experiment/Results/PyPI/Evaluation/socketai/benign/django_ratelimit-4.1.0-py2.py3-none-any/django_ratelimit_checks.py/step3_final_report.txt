  "sources": "Settings 'RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE' and 'CACHES' in Django configuration",
  "sinks": "Errors or warnings generated based on cache backend validation",
  "flows": "Read configuration -> Check cache existence and backend support -> Generate errors/warnings if issues found",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward validation logic with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration validation for Django cache backends, checking for known broken or unsupported backends, and issuing errors or warnings accordingly. It does not execute untrusted code, handle sensitive data, or contain obfuscation. The logic is clear, safe, and aligns with typical Django validation practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low; minor overestimation in one report's security risk score (0.2) can be adjusted to 0. Given the benign nature, the overall assessment is that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Django configuration validation utility with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores across reports are appropriate, with minor adjustments to the security risk score in one report. Overall, it poses no security threat or malware risk.",
