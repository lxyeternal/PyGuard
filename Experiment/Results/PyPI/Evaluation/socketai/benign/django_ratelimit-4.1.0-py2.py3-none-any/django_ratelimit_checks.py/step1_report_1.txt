{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Django system check to verify cache backend configurations for the django_ratelimit application, ensuring that supported and non-broken cache backends are used.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django settings: 'RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE' and 'CACHES' dictionary, and from cache backend configurations within the CACHES setting.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly handle untrusted input data that could lead to security issues or data leaks. It primarily performs configuration validation.",
  "flows": "The function retrieves cache configuration from settings, verifies cache backend values against known and supported backends, and reports errors or warnings based on these checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, such as obfuscated logic or hidden code, are present. The code performs straightforward configuration validation with clear control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django configuration and checks modules, then defines lists and sets of supported and known-broken cache backends. The main function check_caches retrieves cache configuration, validates whether the specified cache exists, and whether its backend is supported or known broken. It generates appropriate errors or warnings accordingly. The logic is standard for configuration validation, with no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate configuration validation for cache backends in a Django application. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The script simply checks for proper cache backend settings to ensure the application functions correctly. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
