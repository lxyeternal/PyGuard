{
  "purpose": "This code is a Django check module that validates cache backend configurations for the 'django_ratelimit' package to ensure proper and supported caching behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads input from Django settings: 'RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE' and 'CACHES' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Uses cache backend configuration data to generate errors or warnings; does not directly write or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads 'RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE' and 'CACHES' from settings -> Checks cache configuration -> Reports errors/warnings based on validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behavior. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation on cache backend settings used for rate limiting. It references known safe backends and issues warnings or errors if the configuration is missing, invalid, or uses unsupported/broken backends. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident; the logic is straightforward configuration validation. No suspicious data leaks, network activities, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration validation script for Django caching settings, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It simply enforces supported cache backends for proper operation.",
