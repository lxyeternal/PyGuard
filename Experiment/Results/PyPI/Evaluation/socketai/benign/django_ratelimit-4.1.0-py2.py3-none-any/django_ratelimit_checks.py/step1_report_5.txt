  "purpose": "The code defines a Django check for validating cache backend configurations used with the django_ratelimit package, ensuring that only supported and properly configured cache backends are used.",
  "sources": "Settings attributes: 'RATELIMIT_USE_CACHE' and 'CACHES' dictionary",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leaks, injections, or malicious data flows detected",
  "flows": "Retrieving cache name from settings → Validating cache configuration and backend → Generating errors/warnings based on validation results",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration validation through Django checks, analyzing cache settings. It references known cache backends and produces errors or warnings if misconfigurations occur. The logic is straightforward, using standard Django practices for settings validation. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection is detected. The code’s focus is on validation and user notification without executing external commands or handling untrusted data beyond configuration parameters.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration validation script for cache backends in Django, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It performs legitimate checks to ensure proper cache setup for django_ratelimit. Overall, it appears safe and compliant with expected usage.",
