  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration that imports a local module during startup. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern depends on the content of 'checks', which is unknown. Based solely on this snippet, the security risk is very low, and the assigned scores are justified."
