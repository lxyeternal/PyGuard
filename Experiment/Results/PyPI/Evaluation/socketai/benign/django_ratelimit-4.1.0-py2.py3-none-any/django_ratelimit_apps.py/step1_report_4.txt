  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration for the 'django_ratelimit' package.",
  "sources": "The code imports the AppConfig class and the 'checks' module during the ready() method.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data outputs or external interactions.",
  "flows": "The only flow is importing the 'checks' module when the app is ready, which is standard in Django app initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Django AppConfig class with a ready() method that imports a local module. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. The import of 'checks' is typical for adding system checks or validations in Django applications. The code is straightforward, minimal, and aligns with common Django patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django application configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of the 'django_ratelimit' package setup.",
