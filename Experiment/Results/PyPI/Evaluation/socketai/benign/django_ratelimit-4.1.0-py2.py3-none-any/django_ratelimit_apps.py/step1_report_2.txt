  "purpose": "Define Django application configuration for 'django_ratelimit' plugin.",
  "sources": "The import statement within the 'ready' method: 'from . import checks'.",
  "sinks": "Importing and executing the 'checks' module, which could potentially execute code if malicious.",
  "flows": "When 'ready' is called, it imports the 'checks' module; if 'checks' contains malicious code, it would execute at this point.",
  "anomalies": "The import within 'ready' is standard for Django apps; no unusual or suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Django AppConfig subclass that specifies app metadata and imports a 'checks' module when the app is ready. The import pattern is typical in Django for initialization or checks. No suspicious behaviors such as network access, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code intent. The only point of concern could be the 'checks' module itself, but its contents are not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django application configuration with a typical 'ready' method import. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected in this code snippet. The overall security risk is very low.",
