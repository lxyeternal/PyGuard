  "conclusion": "The code is a typical rate limiting utility with no active malicious behavior. The primary security concern lies in the use of dynamic imports without input validation, which could be exploited if untrusted inputs are used. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score should be increased to reflect the potential for code injection if inputs are not controlled."
