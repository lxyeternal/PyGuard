  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard package initialization (__init__.py) that imports internal modules and exposes symbols via __all__.\n- No report indicates any dynamic code execution, external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The version string is static and typical.\n- The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the absence of suspicious or malicious code features.\n- The code is not obfuscated, and no malicious payloads are detected.\n\n**Security Risk:**\n- The reports assign very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The code is very simple and only handles imports and exports; it does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- No anomalies, such as hidden code, secrets, or obfuscation, are present.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic operations or external interactions.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code appears entirely benign.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard package initializer that does not pose any security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.",
