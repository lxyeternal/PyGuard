  "purpose": "Package initialization module setting up imports and exports for CLI help coloring components and utilities.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (.core, .utils, .decorators), version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version assignment are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and typical for a Python package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, defining a version string. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data handling from untrusted sources. The code structure is simple and static, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The code does not contain secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The version string is standard and does not impact security. Overall, the code is a standard package setup file with no malicious or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, static package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
