  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and versioning for a Python package related to help color formatting and utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and functions from internal modules (.core, .utils, .decorators) and defines a list of exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data, as no external input, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the imports and exports are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and version info, with imports from internal modules. No external data, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The module appears to be a standard, benign setup for a Python package related to colorized help formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python packages, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
