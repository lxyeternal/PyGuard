{
  "purpose": "This code is setting up imports and exports for a Python package related to colored help messages, likely for CLI tools.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: .core, .utils, .decorators, and the __all__ and __version__ variables within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present; the code only manages internal module references and package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static, and __all__ and __version__ are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets (besides version), or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines import statements, specifies exported symbols, and sets a version string. All operations are static and related to package organization. No external inputs, no sensitive data handling, and no dynamic code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
