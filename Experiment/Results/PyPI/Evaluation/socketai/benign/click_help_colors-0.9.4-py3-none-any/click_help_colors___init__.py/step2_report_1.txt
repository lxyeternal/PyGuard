  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies**:  \n   All reports conclude that the code is a standard package initialization module, primarily importing and exporting symbols, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data. The code is static, straightforward, and typical for a Python package's `__init__.py`. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets (beyond version), obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Errors in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and thorough, emphasizing the benign nature of the code. They correctly identify that the code only sets up imports and exports, with no data sinks or external interactions. There are no logical flaws or reasoning errors.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Malware, Obfuscation, and Risk**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1)  \n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the code's nature. Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely a package setup file with no malicious or risky behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The same applies to malware and obfuscation scores.\n\n5. **Potential Misinterpretations or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not assume malicious intent where there is none. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks are present.\n\n### Overall:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign package initialization module. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's content.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- No issues are present in the code.  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are correct.",
