{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around the Click library's version_option decorator that constructs a colorized version message with placeholders for program name and version, ensuring styled CLI output.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'message', 'prog_name', 'version'; external '_colorize' function; regex splitting of message string.",
  "sinks": "Constructed message string passed to 'click_version_option'; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> message template -> regex split -> colorize parts -> join into final message -> pass to 'click_version_option'.",
  "anomalies": "Relies on external '_colorize' function; no internal anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward string processing.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input parameters, constructs a styled message by replacing placeholders with colorized program name and version, and delegates to Click's version_option decorator. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. The only external dependency '_colorize' is presumed safe as a styling utility. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for CLI version display with colorization. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (0.1) is justified, primarily due to reliance on an external styling function. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use.",
