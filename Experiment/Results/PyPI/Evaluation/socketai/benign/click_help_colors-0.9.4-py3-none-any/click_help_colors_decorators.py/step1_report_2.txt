{
  "purpose": "This code provides a custom decorator for version display in CLI applications using the Click library, with added colorization features.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as version, prog_name, message, and optional color parameters. Uses re.split to parse the message string.",
  "sinks": "Uses the _colorize function to process strings with color parameters, and calls click.version_option with the processed message.",
  "flows": "Inputs (version, prog_name, message, color options) are used to generate a colorized message string, which is then passed to click.version_option.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures or obfuscated code detected. The code uses straightforward string processing, type hints, and a wrapper around an external library.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an overload-based decorator to add colorized version info to CLI commands. It splits the message string by placeholders and replaces them with colorized program name and version, raising errors if required parameters are missing. It then invokes the Click decorator with the processed message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for enhancing CLI version output with colorization. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
