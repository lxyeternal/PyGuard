{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package for ML collections, providing imports and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Imports from ml_collections.config_dict, and the __version__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leakage or malicious data flow detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; the code primarily involves static definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The version string is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package __init__.py file that sets up exports and package versioning. It imports specific classes from an external library, defines __all__ for exports, and assigns a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears benign, intended for package setup and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
