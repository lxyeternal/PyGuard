{
  "purpose": "The code provides a library for managing ML-related Python collections and exports specific classes for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from the 'ml_collections.config_dict' module, which are likely internal to the package or external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, system compromise, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines metadata (__version__) and imports/exports modules/classes; there are no data flow paths involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The __version__ string is a standard version indicator; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code appear.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of license information, documentation, imports, and export statements. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or include any suspicious patterns. All imports are from the same package, indicating normal modular structure. No obfuscated or suspicious code elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward library module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended to export specific classes and version info without any security concerns.",
