  "purpose": "To provide ML collections classes for managing configurations in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'ml_collections.config_dict' and the '__version__' variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward imports and versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from a third-party library 'ml_collections.config_dict' and defines a version string. There are no user inputs, network operations, or file manipulations. The version string is static and not derived from external sources. The imports are standard and related solely to library classes for configuration management. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup for ML configurations, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard and appears safe.",
