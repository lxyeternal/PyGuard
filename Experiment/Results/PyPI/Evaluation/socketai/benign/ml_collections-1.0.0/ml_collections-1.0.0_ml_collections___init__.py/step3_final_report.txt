{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization file that imports specific classes from an external library, defines the module's public API via __all__, and sets a static version string for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'ml_collections.config_dict' and the assignment of '__version__' string.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Static import and assignment; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard package setup file that imports classes, defines exports, and sets a version. No dynamic code, input/output handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. All signals indicate benign, well-structured code with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
