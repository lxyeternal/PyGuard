{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports classes related to ML Collections, a library for managing Python collections for machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'ml_collections.config_dict' module, and the assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is static and only involves import statements and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a library, defines the module's exported classes, and sets a version string. There are no input handling, data processing, or network interactions. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured module source code. No signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard library module that provides class definitions and version information. It shows no malicious intent or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and safe.",
