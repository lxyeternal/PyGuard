      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of a tuple argument parser. It poses minimal security risk and contains no malware or obfuscation. The slight security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the theoretical evaluation risk of ast.literal_eval but is acceptable in controlled CLI contexts. Overall, the code is benign and well-implemented."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, sophisticated configuration management library with a notable security consideration: unvalidated dynamic module loading from user-supplied paths. No active malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.3 reflects the potential for exploitation if paths are not validated. Implementing path validation would mitigate this risk without altering the core functionality."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an example of configuration management. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is slightly conservative; it could be lowered to 0, but remains acceptable given the context. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0."

Minor adjustment could be to set securityRisk to 0, given the absence of any risk factors."
