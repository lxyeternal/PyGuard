  "purpose": "Custom argument parser for tuples, converting string or other inputs into tuple objects for command-line flags.",
  "sources": "Input argument to parse() method, which can be a tuple, string, None, or other object.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; the code evaluates string literals using ast.literal_eval internally, which could evaluate malicious literals if input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input argument -> parse() method -> _convert_str_to_tuple() -> ast.literal_eval -> output tuple",
  "anomalies": "Use of ast.literal_eval on untrusted input could evaluate malicious literals; error handling is standard, no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code safely converts string inputs to tuples using ast.literal_eval, with proper error handling for malformed inputs. It handles different input types appropriately and does not perform any external operations or data leaks. The use of ast.literal_eval is standard for literal evaluation but carries minimal inherent risk if inputs are untrusted. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of a tuple argument parser. It poses minimal security risk and contains no malware or obfuscation. The slight security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the theoretical evaluation risk of ast.literal_eval but is acceptable in controlled CLI contexts. Overall, the code is benign and well-implemented.",
