  "purpose": "Configuration for pytest testing framework, ensuring flags are marked as parsed before tests run.",
  "sources": "Import of 'absl.flags' to read and manipulate command-line flags.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no operations leading to data leaks or security impacts.",
  "flows": "Flags are read and then marked as parsed within the fixture, but no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of absl.flags and pytest fixtures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports absl.flags and pytest, defines a fixture that automatically marks flags as parsed before each test. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data is processed. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is present. The code performs a legitimate setup step common in test environments without any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration script for testing purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
