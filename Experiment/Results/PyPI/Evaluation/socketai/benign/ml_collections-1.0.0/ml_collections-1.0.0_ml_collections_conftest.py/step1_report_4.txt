  "purpose": "Configuration for pytest to automatically mark absl flags as parsed during tests.",
  "sources": "Import of absl.flags and pytest modules; usage of flags.FLAGS.mark_as_parsed()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Import of flags, then invoking mark_as_parsed() which affects internal flag state",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard test setup; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets a fixture to run before tests, and calls a function to mark flags as parsed. This is a typical setup for test environments using absl flags and pytest. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The code’s purpose is clearly to facilitate testing by configuring flag state.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the environment for tests by marking flags as parsed, which is a common pattern in testing with absl and pytest.",
