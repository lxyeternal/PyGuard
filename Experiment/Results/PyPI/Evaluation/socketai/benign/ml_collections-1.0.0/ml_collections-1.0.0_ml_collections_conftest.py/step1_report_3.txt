  "purpose": "Configuration for pytest framework with flag parsing setup",
  "sources": "Import statements from absl and pytest, code within the fixture function",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply sets a flag state",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard testing setup code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing libraries and a flag management library. It defines a pytest fixture that automatically marks command-line flags as parsed before each test function executes. No user input, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code is typical for setting up a test environment and does not perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pytest setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the testing environment and does not contain any suspicious or harmful code.",
