  "purpose": "The script demonstrates the usage of a dataclass configuration with command-line interface integration, primarily for setting and printing configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments processed via absl.app and config_flags to override default configuration values.",
  "sinks": "Printing configuration values to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> config_flags.DEFINE_config_dataclass -> _CONFIG.value -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, defines a dataclass for configuration, initializes it with default values, and exposes it via command-line flags. The command-line argument parsing and configuration management are standard and safe. The print statement outputs the current configuration. There are no indications of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example demonstrating configuration handling with no malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard libraries and practices without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
