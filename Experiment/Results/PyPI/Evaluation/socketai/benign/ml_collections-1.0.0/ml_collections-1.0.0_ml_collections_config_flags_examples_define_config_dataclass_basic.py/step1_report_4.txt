  "purpose": "Demonstration of basic usage of define_config_dataclass from ml_collections for configuration management.",
  "sources": "User input via command line arguments that can modify the configuration, specifically through the --my_config parameter.",
  "sinks": "Printing the configuration object, which could potentially expose sensitive configuration data if misused, but is intended for normal operation.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments (--my_config) → configuration object creation → printing configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and typical configuration handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass for configuration, sets default values, and allows runtime modification via command line arguments. It uses ml_collections for flexible config management and absl for app execution. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The configuration handling appears safe and standard. No external or suspicious code or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example of configuration management using well-known libraries. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code’s purpose is benign, focusing on configuration setup and display.",
