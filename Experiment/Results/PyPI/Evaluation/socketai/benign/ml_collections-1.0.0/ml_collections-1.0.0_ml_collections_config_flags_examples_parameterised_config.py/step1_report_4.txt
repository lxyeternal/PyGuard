  "purpose": "Defines a parameterized method to return configuration objects based on an input string.",
  "sources": "The input parameter `config_string` which determines the configuration returned.",
  "sinks": "The direct access to `possible_structures[config_string]` which could raise a KeyError if `config_string` is invalid, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input `config_string` -> lookup in `possible_structures` dictionary -> return corresponding ConfigDict object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code is straightforward and relies on a simple dictionary lookup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a configuration management library and defines a function to select configurations based on a string input. The function constructs and returns predefined ConfigDict objects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or insecure coding practices. The only potential issue is lack of input validation for `config_string`, which could lead to KeyError exceptions, but this is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a simple configuration selector with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration helper function. It does not contain any malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on its content. It is a straightforward, safe implementation.",
