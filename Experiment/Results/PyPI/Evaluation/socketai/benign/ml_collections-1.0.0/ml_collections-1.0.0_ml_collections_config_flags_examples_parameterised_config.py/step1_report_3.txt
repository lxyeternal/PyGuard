{
  "purpose": "Defines a function that returns a configuration dictionary based on an input string, used for model setup.",
  "sources": "The input parameter `config_string` is read to determine which configuration to return.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data beyond selecting a configuration.",
  "flows": "Input `config_string` flows directly into dictionary key access to select a configuration structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code relies on predefined configuration options.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a configuration dictionary library and defines a function that returns different configuration structures based on a string input. The data flow is straightforward: the input string selects a configuration from a predefined dictionary. There are no external inputs, network calls, or untrusted data processing. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security-critical operations are present. The code is typical for a configuration utility in a machine learning framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply returns predefined configurations based on input.",
