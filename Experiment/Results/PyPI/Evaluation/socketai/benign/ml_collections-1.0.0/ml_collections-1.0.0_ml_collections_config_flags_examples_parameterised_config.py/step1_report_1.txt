  "purpose": "Defines a parameterized method to return configuration objects based on input string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter `config_string` used to select configuration structure.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe data sinks; no external network, file I/O, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Input `config_string` flows into dictionary key lookup to select configuration object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known, benign library `ml_collections`. It defines a function that takes a string input and returns a predefined configuration dictionary based on the input. The `possible_structures` dictionary contains only static configuration data, with no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The function directly indexes into this dictionary without validation, which could raise a KeyError if an unexpected input is provided, but this does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward configuration helper with no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration selection utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It contains no malware or obfuscated code, and the security risk level is minimal.",
