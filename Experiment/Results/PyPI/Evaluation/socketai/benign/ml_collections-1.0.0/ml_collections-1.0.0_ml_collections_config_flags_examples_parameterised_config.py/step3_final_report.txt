  "purpose": "Provides configuration dictionaries based on input string, used for model setup.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'config_string' used to select configuration; static dictionary 'possible_structures'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Input 'config_string' directly indexes into 'possible_structures' to retrieve configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of input validation for 'config_string' could cause KeyError; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static configuration selector that returns predefined ConfigDict objects based on a string key. It imports a benign library and does not perform any external data fetching, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The only minor issue is the absence of input validation, which could lead to a runtime KeyError if an invalid key is provided, but this is not a security concern. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious activity. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the minor robustness issue but not a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malware or malicious intent. The only improvement would be adding input validation to prevent runtime errors, but this does not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
