  "purpose": "Defines a parameterized method that returns configuration dictionaries based on input strings, used for model setup.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'config_string' used to select configuration; import 'ml_collections.config_dict'.",
  "sinks": "Return value from 'possible_structures' based on 'config_string'. No untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input 'config_string' determines selection from 'possible_structures', which returns configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known open-source library 'ml_collections'. It defines a simple function that returns configuration data based on an input string. The configurations are static and predefined. No external data sources, no user input processing beyond a string key, and no execution of dynamic or untrusted code. The structure is standard for configuration management in ML pipelines. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present. The code appears to be a benign utility for configuration selection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility that returns predefined model configurations based on input strings. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
