  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Confirms the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (minimal).  \n- **Comments:** The code is straightforward, static configuration data, no external data or dynamic code execution. The only potential issue is that the function does not validate `config_string`, which could cause a KeyError if an invalid key is provided, but this is not malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, describes the code as a benign configuration utility.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Comments:** No external data sources or suspicious constructs. The code is standard for ML configuration management.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, describes the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Comments:** Straightforward static configuration, no external inputs or dynamic code.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—benign, simple configuration helper.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Comments:** No malicious activity, just a dictionary lookup without validation.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, benign static configuration provider.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Comments:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:**  \n  The code is a simple function returning static configurations based on a string key. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or handle sensitive data.  \n  **Potential concern:** The function does not validate `config_string`, which could lead to a `KeyError` if an invalid key is provided. This is a minor robustness issue, not a security or malware concern.\n\n- **Malware or obfuscation:**  \n  No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code is clear and uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk. This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign such scores; they are all minimal, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:**  \n  The only \"vulnerability\" is the lack of input validation, which could cause runtime errors, but this does not constitute a security risk or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to lack of input validation, not security concern)  \n\n**Overall, the code is a benign configuration utility with no security or malicious issues.**",
