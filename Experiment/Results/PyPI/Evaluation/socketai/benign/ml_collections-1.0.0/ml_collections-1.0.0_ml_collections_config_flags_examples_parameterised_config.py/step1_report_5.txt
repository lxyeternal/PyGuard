  "purpose": "Provides a configuration retrieval function that returns a ConfigDict object based on the input string, used for setting up machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Input parameter `config_string` passed to `get_config` function.",
  "sinks": "Access to `possible_structures[config_string]` which retrieves configuration data; no untrusted data flows outside this function.",
  "flows": "The function takes `config_string`, looks it up in `possible_structures`, and returns the corresponding ConfigDict object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard library functions and constructs without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known library `ml_collections`, defines a function that returns predefined configurations based on a string input. The data structures are static and hardcoded. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no handling of sensitive data. The function simply returns a dictionary based on a key, which is a typical pattern in configuration management. The code appears well-structured, with clear licensing comments, and no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration provider with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It safely returns predefined configuration objects based on the input string.",
