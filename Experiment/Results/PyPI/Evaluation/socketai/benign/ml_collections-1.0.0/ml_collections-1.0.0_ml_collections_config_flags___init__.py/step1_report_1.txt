{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a configuration flags module for a larger Python project, providing import and export of functions related to configuration handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.config_flags' which likely contains core implementation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The module primarily re-exports functions from '.config_flags'; no data flows or processing logic are visible here.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of suspicious or unusual code. The code is straightforward, with standard import/export patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and exposes them via __all__, typical for a Python package's module interface. No data processing, user input, or external data sources are involved. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface for configuration management. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified based on this fragment.",
