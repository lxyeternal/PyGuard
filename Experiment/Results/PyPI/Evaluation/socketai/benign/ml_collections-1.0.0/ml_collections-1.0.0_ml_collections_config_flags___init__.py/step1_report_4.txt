  "purpose": "Module to define and manage configuration flags for a larger software system.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local module '.config_flags'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow or execution of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and a list defining public API symbols. There are no dynamic code executions, no data handling, nor any operations involving untrusted inputs. The functions imported appear to be for configuration management, which is standard in software projects. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The license header is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, clean, and serves a configuration purpose without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module that imports and exposes functions from a local submodule. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a safe and normal part of a larger software project.",
