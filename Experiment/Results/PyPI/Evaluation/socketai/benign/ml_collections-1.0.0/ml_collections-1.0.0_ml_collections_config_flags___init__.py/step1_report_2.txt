  "purpose": "This module appears to be a configuration flags utility, providing functions to define and retrieve configuration settings.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a local module (.config_flags).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; no data outputs or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports and re-exports functions; there are no data flows, source-to-sink paths, or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and defines the __all__ list to specify exported symbols. There is no data processing, user input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution. All operations are static and typical for a configuration utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
