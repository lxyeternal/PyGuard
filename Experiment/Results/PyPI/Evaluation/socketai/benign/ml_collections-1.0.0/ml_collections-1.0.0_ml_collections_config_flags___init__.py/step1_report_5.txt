  "purpose": "This module provides configuration flag definitions and utility functions for handling configuration data.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from a local module named 'config_flags' and defines an export list.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks, no untrusted data processing, no external data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports and re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, licensing comments, and an explicit list of exported identifiers. It appears to be a standard module setup for configuration handling. No external inputs, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. The code's structure and content are consistent with common, safe Python module practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a straightforward configuration module import/export wrapper.",
