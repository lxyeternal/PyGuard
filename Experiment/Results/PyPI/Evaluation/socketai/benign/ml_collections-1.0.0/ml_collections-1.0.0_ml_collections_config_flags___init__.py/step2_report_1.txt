  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a simple Python module that imports specific functions from a local module `.config_flags` and re-exports them via the `__all__` list.\n- It includes a standard license header.\n- There are no data processing, user inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Analysis:\n\n**Presence of Issues:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are identified.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as an interface for configuration functions.\n\n**Error or Flaws in Reports:**\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports. They are consistent and correctly interpret the code.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified because there is no security risk or malicious activity.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume the imported module `.config_flags` is safe and trustworthy. Since the code only re-exports functions, the risk depends on the implementation of `.config_flags`.\n- Without inspecting `.config_flags`, we cannot fully guarantee safety, but based on this fragment alone, there are no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                      |\n|--------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious activity detected in the code snippet.                |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear, straightforward, and standard.                       |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No security issues or vulnerabilities apparent.                    |\n\n**Additional comments:**\n- The code is a typical pattern for exposing internal functions in a Python package.\n- The license header is standard and unrelated to security concerns.\n- The trustworthiness hinges on the implementation of `.config_flags`, which is outside this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Rationale                                                        |\n|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code or behavior present.                          |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is transparent and straightforward.                         |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors evident.                  |\n\n**Final note:** Always review the implementation of imported modules (`.config_flags`) for comprehensive security assurance.",
