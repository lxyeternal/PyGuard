  "purpose": "Module that defines and exports configuration flag functions and constants for a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the local module '.config_flags'. No external data sources or input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data handling, data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; primarily defining and exporting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, with standard import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and re-exports them in the __all__ list. It contains no logic, user input handling, or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, malicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present. The license header is standard and unrelated to security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration flags module intended for project setup. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is a benign, structural part of a larger codebase.",
