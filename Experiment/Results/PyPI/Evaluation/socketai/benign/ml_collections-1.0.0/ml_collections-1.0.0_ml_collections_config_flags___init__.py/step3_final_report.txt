  "purpose": "Re-exports configuration functions from the local module `.config_flags` for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from `.config_flags` module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import of functions from `.config_flags` with no data flow beyond module boundaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, straightforward Python module that imports specific functions from a local module and exposes them via `__all__`. It contains a standard license header and no dynamic or external interactions. All security and malware assessments are based on the absence of suspicious patterns, data flows, or malicious code. The code's simplicity and structure indicate it is benign. The trustworthiness depends on the implementation of `.config_flags`, but this snippet alone shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface module with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and consistent. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, which is appropriate.",
