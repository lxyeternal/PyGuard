  "purpose": "Defines a function to create and return a ConfigDict object with preset fields.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only constructs an object internally.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data output points are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of a configuration object library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'ml_collections.config_dict' and defines 'get_config' which creates a ConfigDict instance, populates it with static fields, and returns it. No user input, no external data, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors or backdoors are present. The code appears to serve a straightforward configuration purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
