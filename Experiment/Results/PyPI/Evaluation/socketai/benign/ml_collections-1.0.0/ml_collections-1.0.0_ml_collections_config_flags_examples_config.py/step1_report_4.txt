{
  "purpose": "Defines a method to create and return a configuration object using the ml_collections library.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'config_dict' module from 'ml_collections'. No external input or data is read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows, nor any data output to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "The function constructs a ConfigDict object with hardcoded values; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a configuration utility and defines a simple function that creates a configuration object with preset values. It uses a third-party library 'ml_collections', which is common in machine learning projects. There are no external inputs, data manipulation, or network operations. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard usage. No indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply creates and returns a configuration object with predefined values.",
