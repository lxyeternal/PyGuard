{
  "purpose": "Provides a static configuration object with predefined fields and nested configurations.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment within the function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data assigned directly to configuration fields.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known configuration library, defines a function that creates and returns a ConfigDict with static, hardcoded values, including integers, strings, floats, tuples, and nested ConfigDicts. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no obfuscation. The code is simple, clear, and serves as a configuration utility. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious activity, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level of 1 is justified due to the straightforward, static nature of the code, and there are no indications of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration utility with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the safe nature of the code. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
