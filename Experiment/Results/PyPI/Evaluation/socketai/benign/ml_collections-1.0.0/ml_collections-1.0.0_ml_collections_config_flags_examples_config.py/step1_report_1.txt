  "purpose": "Defines a method to create and return a configuration object using ml_collections' ConfigDict.",
  "sources": "Imports ml_collections.config_dict; function get_config reads no external input, only uses hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only constructs and returns a static configuration object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard configuration library, defines a function that creates a ConfigDict instance, assigns some static values including integers, strings, floats, and a tuple, then returns this configuration object. There are no external inputs, no data flows from external sources, and no suspicious operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility function for configuration management without any malicious or security concerns.",
