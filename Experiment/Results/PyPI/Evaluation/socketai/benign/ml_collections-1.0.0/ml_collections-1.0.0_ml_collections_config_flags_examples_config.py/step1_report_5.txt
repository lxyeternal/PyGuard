  "purpose": "Defines and returns a configuration object using ml_collections' ConfigDict.",
  "sources": "Import from ml_collections and the get_config function where local variables are assigned.",
  "fires": "No untrusted data sources or input handling; configuration values are hardcoded or assigned locally.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; configuration values are set internally and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard library and a well-known package for configuration management with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard configuration library, creates a ConfigDict object, and populates it with static, hardcoded values, including nested ConfigDicts and tuples. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or insecure patterns. The purpose is to generate a configuration object for use elsewhere. No signs of malicious or maliciously manipulated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely for configuration setup with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
