  "purpose": "Defines a function to create and return a ConfigDict object with preset fields and nested configuration.",
  "sources": "Import of ml_collections.config_dict; creation of ConfigDict object; assignment of static values to fields.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurring.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and uses standard library functions; no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a known configuration management library and creates a configuration object with static, hardcoded values. There is no indication of input reading, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The structure and syntax are typical for such use cases, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely constructs and returns a configuration object with fixed values.",
