  "purpose": "Example script demonstrating the usage of ml_collections' ConfigDict for configuration management.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for configuration overrides and the predefined config object.",
  "sinks": "Prints the final configuration object to standard output.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs modify the config object; the final config is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. Usage is straightforward and aligns with documented examples.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and ml_collections modules, defines a configuration dictionary with some fields, and uses absl.app to handle command-line arguments for configuration overrides. The code outputs the final configuration via print. There are no external data flows, no untrusted data sources besides command-line arguments, and no suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a configuration example for ml_collections and abides by normal usage patterns. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
