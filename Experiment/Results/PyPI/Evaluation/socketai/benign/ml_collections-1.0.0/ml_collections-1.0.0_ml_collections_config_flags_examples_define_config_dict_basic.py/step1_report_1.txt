  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of ml_collections' ConfigDict and config_flags for configuration management in Python scripts.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via app.run, imports from ml_collections (config_dict, config_flags), and uses them to define and print configuration data.",
  "targets": "Prints configuration data; no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> app.run(main) -> config_flags.DEFINE_config_dict -> main() prints config value",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a configuration dictionary with default values, employs absl.app for command-line handling, and prints the configuration. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity. It appears to be a benign example or utility script demonstrating configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of configuration handling with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
