  "purpose": "This script demonstrates the usage of the ml_collections library for defining and handling configuration dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from command-line arguments via the config_flags.DEFINE_config_dict and app.run methods.",
  "sinks": "The command-line arguments and configuration data are ultimately printed or used within the application; no data leaks or external calls are evident.",
  "flows": "Input via command-line arguments (config_flags.DEFINE_config_dict) flows into the configuration object, which is printed in the main function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of well-known libraries and standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and ml_collections for configuration management, defines a simple configuration dictionary, and provides a command-line interface. The flow involves reading user inputs through command-line arguments, setting up configurations, and printing the configuration. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward example or template for configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign example demonstrating configuration management with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It safely handles user input for configuration purposes.",
