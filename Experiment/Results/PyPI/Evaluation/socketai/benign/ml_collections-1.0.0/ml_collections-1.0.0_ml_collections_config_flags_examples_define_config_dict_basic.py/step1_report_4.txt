{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate the usage of the ml_collections library for defining and managing configuration dictionaries in Python scripts.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line argument '--my_config_dict' provided at runtime, which is used to set or override configuration values.",
  "sinks": "The configuration values are printed to standard output; there are no direct data leaks or external communications. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed by the absl app framework and used to set configuration values, which are then printed in the main function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard libraries and configuration management patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries (absl and ml_collections), defines a configuration dictionary, assigns static values, and sets up command-line flags to override these values at runtime. The main function simply prints the current configuration. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, using typical configuration patterns for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example demonstrating configuration management. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious features.",
