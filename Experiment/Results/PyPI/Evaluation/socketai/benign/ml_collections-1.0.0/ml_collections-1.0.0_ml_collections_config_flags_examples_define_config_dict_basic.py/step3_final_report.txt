  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of ml_collections' ConfigDict and config_flags for configuration management in Python scripts.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments processed via absl.flags to override configuration values.",
  "sinks": "Printing the configuration object; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Command-line input flows into configuration object, which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward example of configuration setup using standard libraries. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. No secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The command-line argument handling is standard and does not introduce security risks in this context. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an example of configuration management. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is slightly conservative; it could be lowered to 0, but remains acceptable given the context. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0.",
