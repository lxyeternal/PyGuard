  "purpose": "Provides static version information by parsing a predefined JSON string.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded JSON string within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Function get_versions() reads the static JSON string and returns the parsed dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static JSON string with version info, loaded via json.loads() in a function. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The code is simple, benign, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its static and safe nature, assigning malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, with high confidence. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info provider with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
