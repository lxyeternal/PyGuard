  "purpose": "To generate and return version information from a JSON string representing version metadata.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string 'version_json' within the code.",
  "sinks": "The json.loads function which parses the JSON string into a Python dictionary.",
  "flows": "The code reads the static JSON string 'version_json' and parses it through json.loads, returning the resulting data.",
  "anomalies": "The JSON data is hardcoded and static; no external input or environment variables are used. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation are present. The file comments suggest it is auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The script is simple: it defines a static JSON string with version metadata and a function to parse and return this data. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network activity, no execution of dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a benign, auto-generated version info provider. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, serving as an auto-generated version information provider with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
