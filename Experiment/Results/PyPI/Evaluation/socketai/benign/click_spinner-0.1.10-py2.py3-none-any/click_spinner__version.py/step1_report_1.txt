{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate version information for a package, likely used in version tracking or display.",
  "sources": "Reads embedded JSON string 'version_json' which contains version data.",
  "sinks": "Returns the parsed JSON object from the embedded string, no untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "The static JSON string is loaded and returned by the get_versions() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains static data with no external input or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports json and sys modules, defines a static JSON string with version metadata, and provides a function to parse and return this data. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. The JSON data is hardcoded, which indicates it is a pre-generated static version info file. The code appears to be part of a versioning or build process, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for returning static version information. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
