  "purpose": "A terminal spinner utility for indicating progress during long-running operations.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdout, threading.Event, itertools.cycle; imports version info from a local module.",
  "sinks": "Writes spinner characters and optional beep sound to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Spinner thread cycles through characters, writing to stdout; main thread manages start/stop via context manager.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation; standard threading and output handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward, standard CLI spinner using threading and itertools. It writes characters to stdout, optionally beeps, and manages thread lifecycle cleanly. No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. Reliance on stdout is typical but could be exploited if stdout is redirected maliciously, which is a common consideration for CLI tools. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard terminal spinner utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (~0.1) assigned in the reports is appropriate, reflecting minimal environmental risk. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this code is very safe.",
