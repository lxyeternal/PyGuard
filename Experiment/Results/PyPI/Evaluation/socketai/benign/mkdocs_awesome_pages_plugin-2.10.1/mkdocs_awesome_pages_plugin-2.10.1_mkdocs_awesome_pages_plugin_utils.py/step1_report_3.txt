  "purpose": "Utility functions and a context manager for handling and manipulating filesystem paths and directories.",
  "sources": "Reading the current working directory via os.getcwd() in __enter__ method of the context manager; reading input parameters for path manipulation functions.",
  "sinks": "os.chdir() in the __enter__ and __exit__ methods; os.path functions for path manipulations.",
  "flows": "Input paths are processed by functions; the context manager changes the directory based on a new path; path functions return modified path strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors. Functions are straightforward and utilize standard library calls without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic filesystem path utilities and a context manager for changing directories. All functions and methods use standard library functions without unusual or dynamic code execution. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or network operations. The path manipulations are safe, and the context manager manages directory changes with proper save and restore logic. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard utility functions and a context manager for directory handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and secure for general use.",
