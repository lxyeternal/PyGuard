  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for path manipulation and a context manager for changing directories",
  "sources": "Reads input paths from function arguments and class instantiation",
  "sinks": "os module functions (os.getcwd, os.chdir, os.path.dirname, os.path.basename, os.path.normpath, os.path.join) that operate on provided paths",
  "flows": "Input paths from function arguments or class instantiation flow into os.path functions and os.chdir/os.getcwd calls",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager for changing the current working directory and several path utility functions that operate on optional string inputs. All operations use the standard os.path and os module functions. There is no indication of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The functions do not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modification beyond directory changes, which are controlled within a context manager.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of utility functions for path handling and directory context management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this module.",
