  "purpose": "Utility functions for filesystem path manipulation and a context manager for changing directories",
  "sources": "Function arguments (paths), os.getcwd() in context manager",
  "sinks": "os.chdir() in context manager",
  "flows": "Input paths -> os.path functions; context manager -> os.chdir()",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard filesystem utilities with proper handling of None inputs and directory state management. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input is present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The functions operate solely on provided path arguments, and the context manager correctly saves/restores the working directory. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for path operations and directory context management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security risk score reflects the potential for directory changes if misused with untrusted input, but in isolation, it is safe.",
