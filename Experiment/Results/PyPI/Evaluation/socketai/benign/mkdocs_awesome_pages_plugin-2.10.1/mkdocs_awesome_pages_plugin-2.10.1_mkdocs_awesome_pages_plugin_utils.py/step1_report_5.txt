  "purpose": "Utility functions for path manipulation and a context manager for changing directories.",
  "sources": "os and typing modules, user-provided path arguments",
  "sinks": "os functions (os.chdir, os.path functions) which operate on paths",
  "flows": "Input paths are processed via functions, potentially used with untrusted input for filesystem operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Functions are straightforward wrappers around standard os functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides basic filesystem utility functions: changing directory context and path manipulations. The context manager saves/restores the working directory, while the functions return path components or normalize paths. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. Usage of os functions is standard and does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard utility code for path handling and directory context management with no malicious behavior detected. It does not include suspicious activity or malicious logic.",
