  "purpose": "Define a class for storing options with various parameters related to file processing and sorting behavior.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; parameters are set via constructor arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "Initialization flow where constructor parameters are assigned to instance variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The class simply encapsulates configuration options with typical attribute assignments. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious behavior. The parameters are standard for configuration objects. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for configuration purposes with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
