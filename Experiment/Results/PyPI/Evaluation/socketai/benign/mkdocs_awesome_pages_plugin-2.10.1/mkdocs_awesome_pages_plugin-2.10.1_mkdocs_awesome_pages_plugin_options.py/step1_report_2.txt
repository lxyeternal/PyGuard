  "purpose": "Defines a class for handling configuration options with various parameters related to file processing and sorting.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only initializes class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed; code is straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a class 'Options' with an initializer accepting multiple parameters, some with default values. The parameters are used to set instance variables. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The code appears to serve as a simple data container, with no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class definition for configuration purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears safe and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
