  "purpose": "Define a configuration class 'Options' to store various settings related to file handling and sorting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from parameters to class instance variables, with no further processing or evaluation present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward and does not include any dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The class simply stores parameters provided during instantiation without processing or executing any logic. No input validation, sanitization, or unsafe operations are present. The code appears to serve as a data container for configuration options. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition used for storing configuration options. There are no security risks, malware, or anomalies detected based on the provided code.",
