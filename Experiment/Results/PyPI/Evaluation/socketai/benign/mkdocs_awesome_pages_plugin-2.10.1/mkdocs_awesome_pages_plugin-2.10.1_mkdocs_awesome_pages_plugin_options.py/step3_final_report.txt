  "purpose": "Defines a simple configuration class Options with parameters for file handling and sorting options.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters: filename, collapse_single_pages, strict, order, sort_type, order_by, ignore_case.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "Assignment of constructor parameters directly to instance variables; no data flow beyond initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward parameter assignment, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic data container class with no external data reads, system calls, or malicious constructs. All parameters are assigned directly without validation or processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration class with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
