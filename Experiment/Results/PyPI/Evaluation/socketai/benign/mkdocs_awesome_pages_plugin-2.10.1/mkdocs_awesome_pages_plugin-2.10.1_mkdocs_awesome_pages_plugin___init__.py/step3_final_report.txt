{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or communication tasks without malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data reads, function definitions, module imports, environment variables, network communication points",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via network transmission, environment variables, or file writes; use of untrusted input data",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to output or network transmission points",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code structure is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. It uses common libraries, performs expected operations, and lacks suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms. Confidence in benign nature is high, but limited context warrants cautious low risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) and malware score (0) are justified given the analysis. The confidence level (0.75) reflects high certainty in the benign assessment, considering the limited code context.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
