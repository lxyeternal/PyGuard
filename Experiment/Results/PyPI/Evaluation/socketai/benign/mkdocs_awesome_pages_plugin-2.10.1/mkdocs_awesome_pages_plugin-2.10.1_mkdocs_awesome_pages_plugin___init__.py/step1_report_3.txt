  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to import modules and define functions, potentially for data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules, environment variables, and possibly user input if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or execution functions that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious function calls are evident. The code structure appears typical, with no obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines functions, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoor mechanisms. The overall structure does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. Without more context, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate with standard practices, and no anomalies are observed.",
