{
  "purpose": "Manage, run inference, and export TensorFlow models within an ONNX backend framework.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the run() method, particularly the 'inputs' parameter; tf_module's call method; self.signatures during export.",
  "sinks": "Output variables returned by tf_module; model export file written to disk via tf.saved_model.save().",
  "flows": "Inputs are converted to tensors, passed into tf_module, outputs are processed and returned; during export, the model is serialized to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom attribute 'is_export' on tf_module; no other suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard TensorFlow model wrapper for ONNX backend. It converts inputs into tensors, executes the model, and processes outputs into numpy arrays. The export function serializes the model to disk using tf.saved_model.save(). No network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The 'is_export' attribute is a custom flag but not inherently malicious. The code follows best practices and does not exhibit vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing typical model management tasks without any malicious behavior or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation.",
