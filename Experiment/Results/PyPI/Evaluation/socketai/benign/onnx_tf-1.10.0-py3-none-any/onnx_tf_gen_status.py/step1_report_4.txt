{
  "purpose": "This script generates a support status report for ONNX and ONNX-TensorFlow, including version details and supported operators.",
  "sources": "Inputs come from command-line arguments, environment (git commit hash, version info), and file system (docs directory).",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to a Markdown file; subprocess command execution retrieves git commit ID; network access is not present.",
  "flows": "Command-line args influence filename and report type; subprocess retrieves git hash; data collected from onnx package and environment flows into report writing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. Use of subprocess to get git commit ID is typical for version reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs version retrieval, data aggregation, and report generation. It uses subprocess to get git commit hash, reads ONNX and TensorFlow version info, and writes structured markdown output. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are identified. Usage of standard modules and practices appears benign. No data exfiltration, malicious commands, or suspicious network activity are present. The only external interaction is subprocess call for version info, which is normal for version tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate utility for generating support status documentation. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It relies on standard library and package functionalities without suspicious operations.",
