{
  "purpose": "This script generates a support status report for ONNX and ONNX-TensorFlow, including version information and supported operators, and writes it to a markdown file.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, reads ONNX and TensorFlow version info, runs subprocess to get git commit id, reads schemas from onnx.defs.",
  "sinks": "Writes support status markdown file, executes 'git rev-parse HEAD' command via subprocess, decodes subprocess output.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments → setting variables → subprocess call for git commit id → writing version info and schemas to markdown file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses subprocess to execute shell command 'git rev-parse HEAD' without sanitization, which could be exploited if input is manipulated. No other suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version and schema data collection for ONNX and ONNX-TensorFlow, then writes a formatted support status report to a file. The subprocess call for retrieving the git commit ID could be a minor concern if input is manipulated, but in this context, it appears to be a controlled operation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The code's purpose is documentation generation, with standard use of libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard support status report generator with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The only minor point is the subprocess call to get the git commit ID, which is typical for such scripts and does not constitute malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears safe.",
