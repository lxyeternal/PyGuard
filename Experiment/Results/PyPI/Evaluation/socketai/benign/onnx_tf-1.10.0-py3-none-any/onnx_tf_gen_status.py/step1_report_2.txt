{
  "purpose": "This script generates a support status report for ONNX and ONNX-TensorFlow, including version information and supported operators across different opset versions.",
  "sources": "Input source: command-line arguments and subprocess calls for git commit hash. Data reading from onnx, tf modules, and environment during execution.",
  "sinks": "File writing to generate markdown report; subprocess call executes shell command for git hash; no untrusted data sinks found.",
  "flows": "Command-line args → conditional logic modifies version variables → subprocess call retrieves git commit hash → data compiled into markdown report and written to file.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or unusual code behavior observed. Use of subprocess with shell=True is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious here. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads command-line options and gathers version info from imported modules and git. It writes structured markdown report files based on this data. The subprocess call to 'git rev-parse HEAD' could be a concern if input was manipulated, but in this context, it seems intended for retrieving current commit hash. No data leakage, malicious command execution, or suspicious network activity detected. Usage of subprocess with shell=True is a minor concern but not malicious in this context. Overall, the code is straightforward and aims to generate documentation support status.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears benign, focused on generating a status report for ONNX and ONNX-TF support. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are evident. The only minor concern is subprocess call with shell=True, but it is used safely to get a git commit hash. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
