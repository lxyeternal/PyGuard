{
  "purpose": "The script generates a support status markdown report for ONNX and ONNX-TensorFlow, including version info, supported operators, and compatibility details.",
  "sources": "Command line arguments, version info from imported modules, subprocess call to 'git rev-parse HEAD', and file I/O operations.",
  "sinks": "Writing to markdown file, executing 'git rev-parse HEAD' via subprocess.",
  "flows": "Command line args influence report type; subprocess output provides git commit hash; data is written to file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True for static command; broad exception handling in main function.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version collection, operator schema analysis, and report generation without malicious intent. The subprocess call with shell=True is a minor security concern but used safely with a static command. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The overall logic is straightforward and intended for documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate support status generator with minimal security concerns. No malware or obfuscation detected. The use of subprocess with shell=True is acceptable here given the static command. Existing scores are appropriate.",
