{
  "purpose": "This script generates a support status report for ONNX and ONNX-TensorFlow, including version information, supported operators, and compatibility details.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments, reads version info from imported libraries, runs 'git rev-parse HEAD' subprocess, reads files from filesystem, reads schema data from onnx library",
  "sinks": "Executes shell command ('git rev-parse HEAD') via subprocess, writes output to a file, prints usage info to stdout",
  "flows": "Command line args -> main() -> gen_support_status() -> subprocess call (git) -> file write operations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; use of subprocess to execute 'git rev-parse HEAD' is standard for obtaining current commit id, but it involves shell=True which can be risky if command input is manipulated (though in this context, static command). No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command line options to determine report parameters, retrieves version information for ONNX, ONNX-TF, and TensorFlow, and generates a markdown report with operator support details. It calls subprocess.check_output with shell=True to obtain the current git commit id, which is a potential risk if input was untrusted, but here it is a static command. The script writes data to a file in the specified directory. All other operations involve reading data from imported libraries or filesystem without suspicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate task of generating a support status report for ONNX and ONNX-TensorFlow. It employs standard practices, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. The only minor concern is the use of 'shell=True' in subprocess, which could be exploited if combined with untrusted input, but here it is used with a static command. Overall, the script appears safe and intended for legitimate support reporting purposes.",
