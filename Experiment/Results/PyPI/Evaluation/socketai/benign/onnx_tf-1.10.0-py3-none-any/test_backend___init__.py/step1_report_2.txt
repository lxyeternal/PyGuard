{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard utility module for data processing, lacking explicit purpose within this fragment.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not clearly defined; no explicit input functions or data reads are visible.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data being sent to external systems or files; no suspicious output functions observed.",
  "flows": "No identifiable flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. No use of dangerous functions or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly contains class definitions, utility functions, and possibly data processing routines. No network activity, system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, credential theft, or malicious payloads are evident. The code structure is clean and conventional, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code fragment, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a benign, standard component of a larger project. However, without context of how this code integrates with other parts, absolute certainty is limited.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
