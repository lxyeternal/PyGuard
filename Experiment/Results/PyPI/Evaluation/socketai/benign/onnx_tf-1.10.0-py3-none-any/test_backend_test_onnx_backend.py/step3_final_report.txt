{
  "purpose": "Configure and run ONNX backend tests for TensorFlow, managing test exclusions based on known limitations, environment variables, and version checks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'TRAVIS'), imported modules, version and legacy checks.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Static configuration flow based on environment and version conditions; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious logic; straightforward test setup and exclusion management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines functions to retrieve supported operations, and configures test exclusions based on known issues, environment variables, and version checks. It does not perform any network communication, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input. The purpose is solely to manage test execution conditions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, standard test configuration for ONNX-TF backend validation. It manages test exclusions based on known limitations and environment conditions without any malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to environment variable influence, which is typical in CI/CD contexts.",
