  "conclusion": "This script is a benign, standard test configuration for ONNX-TF backend validation. It manages test exclusions based on known limitations and environment conditions without any malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to environment variable influence, which is typical in CI/CD contexts."
