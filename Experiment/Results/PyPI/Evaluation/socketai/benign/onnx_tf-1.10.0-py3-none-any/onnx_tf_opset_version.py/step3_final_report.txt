  "purpose": "Static configuration data mapping operator names to supported versions and partial support notes for a backend compatibility layer.",
  "sources": "The dictionaries 'backend_opset_version' and 'backend_partial_support' serve as data sources, providing static mappings and notes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data; it is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or dynamic data processing; the code consists solely of static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains straightforward static dictionaries with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is static data defining supported operator versions and partial support notes. No functions, I/O, network activity, or dynamic execution are present. The data appears to be configuration or documentation for model conversion support. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The reasoning in all reports correctly identifies the data as safe and non-malicious, with no need for adjustments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration dataset with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
