{
  "purpose": "The code defines support data structures for ONNX backend operations, including supported versions and partial support notes for certain operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded dictionaries containing operation names, supported versions, and partial support descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user inputs, or external data handling are present. No data leaks or external network interactions are detected.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply provides static mappings and descriptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated constructs, are present. The support notes contain explanatory text but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is static data defining supported ONNX operations and their compatibility notes with TensorFlow. There are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output handling, and no code execution beyond static dictionary definitions. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is present. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security risks or data leaks. It appears to be documentation or configuration data for model conversion support, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration dataset outlining supported operations and partial support limitations for a backend converter. There are no malicious or suspicious behaviors, and the code poses no security threats.",
