{
  "purpose": "This code defines dictionaries that specify supported operator versions and partial support notes for a neural network backend, likely used for model conversion or compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The dictionaries are hardcoded data structures embedded directly in the code; no external input sources or user data are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no functions, external calls, or data outputs that could leak untrusted data or cause side effects; the code solely defines static data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only contains static definitions and explanatory notes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs are present. The content appears straightforward, consisting of static data mappings and support notes.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining support information for various neural network operators. There are no functions, input handling, network connections, or dynamic execution. The data structures seem to serve as configuration or compatibility references. The presence of partial support notes indicates intended operational limitations, but these are benign and informational. There is no evidence of code intended to perform malicious actions, data theft, or system disruption.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration listing supported operators and their limitations for a backend conversion or validation tool. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The content is straightforward and serves as documentation or support metadata.",
