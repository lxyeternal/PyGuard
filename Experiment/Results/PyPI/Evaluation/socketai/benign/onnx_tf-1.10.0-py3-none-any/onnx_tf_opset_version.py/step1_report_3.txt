{
  "purpose": "The code defines two dictionaries: one mapping operation names to supported backend versions, and another detailing partial support limitations or warnings for various operations in TensorFlow conversion scenarios.",
  "sources": "The data is static, hardcoded within the Python script, with no external input or data reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs are present; the code does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines data structures and support notes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code consists solely of static data definitions with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static configuration and support information related to operations and their support status in TensorFlow conversion. It contains no runtime logic, external inputs, or dynamic behavior. The support notes are straightforward and related to backend compatibility issues. No indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are detected. The code appears to be a benign configuration mapping for model conversion support scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data structure used for documentation or support purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
