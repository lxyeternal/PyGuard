  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, controlled test script for ONNX to TensorFlow model conversion. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities are detected. The subprocess execution is typical for such testing and uses static, trusted inputs. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
