  "purpose": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python script performing data processing or system interaction with no suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from standard input, environment variables, or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential output to network, files, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources are processed and potentially sent to sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and benign, with no evidence of malicious intent. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The confidence in benign nature is high (0.8). No obfuscation or malware indicators are observed. The security risk is minimal (0.2), justified by the lack of suspicious activity but acknowledging limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated features detected. The security risk is low, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
