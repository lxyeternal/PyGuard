  "conclusion": "The code is safe, legitimate testing code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (~0.1) is justified by filesystem operations, which are standard in testing routines. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is suitable for use in secure environments."
