  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine output; no external data sources or dynamic inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static text to standard output (`sys.stdout`); no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) flows to printing version; otherwise, flows to printing package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, no malicious constructs, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static CLI script that prints package info or version. It reads `sys.argv` to check for `--version` and writes to stdout. No external calls, no dynamic data, no sensitive info, no obfuscation, and no malicious code are present. The logic is correct, and the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or near zero) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
