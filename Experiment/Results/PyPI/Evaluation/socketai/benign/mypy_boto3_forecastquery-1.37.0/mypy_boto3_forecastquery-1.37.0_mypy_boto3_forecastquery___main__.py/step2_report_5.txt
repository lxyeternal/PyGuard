  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification Against Reports**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - All reports confirm the code's simplicity, lack of dynamic behavior, external dependencies, or suspicious features.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the script, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - The scores are all very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, handle sensitive data, or execute malicious logic.\n   - The minimal security risk score (0.1) might be a conservative default, but given the analysis, even this could be lowered to 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware activity.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so malware score remains at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they rely on code inspection.\n   - They correctly conclude the script's benign nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns.\n- Malware score: **0**\n- Obfuscated score: **0**\n- Risk score: **0** (or possibly 0.1 if conservative)\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and benign intent.",
