  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv)",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout (sys.stdout.write)",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) → main() → print_version() or print_info() → stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No unusual language features or obfuscation. The code simply outputs static package info and version.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward, handling CLI commands to display package info or version. It only reads sys.argv for input and writes static strings to stdout, with no dynamic or external data sources, network calls, or sensitive data handling. The functions perform simple print operations, and the control flow is standard. There are no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign CLI utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
