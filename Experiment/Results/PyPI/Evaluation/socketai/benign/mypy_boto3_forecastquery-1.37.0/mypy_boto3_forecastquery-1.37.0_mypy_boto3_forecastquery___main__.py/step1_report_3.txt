  "purpose": "CLI script for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments; sys.stdout for printing information.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for output; sys.argv for input triggers.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() -> output version; otherwise, print_info() -> output package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious network activity or data leaks. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a simple informational purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for standard input/output operations. It defines two functions: print_info() and print_version(), which output package metadata and version number, respectively. The main() function checks for '--version' in command-line arguments to decide which function to call. The script executes main() when run as the main module. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data fetching, no obfuscated or suspicious constructs, and no hidden behaviors. The code's simplicity and clear intent suggest no malicious or security risk behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package information and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe script intended for informational purposes.",
