  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It imports only `sys`, uses straightforward functions, and performs simple print operations.\n- No dynamic data fetching, external network calls, or sensitive data handling.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious constructs, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- The code appears correct and functions as intended.\n- No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or implementation.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature, simplicity, and security of the code.\n- They correctly identify that the script only outputs static information, with no suspicious behavior.\n- No flaws or mistakes in their reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 or very close to 0\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n- The highest reported `securityRisk` is 0.1, which is very low.\n- The code is purely informational, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- No reason to assign higher risk scores.\n\n**Conclusion:** The low risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0.\n- This is accurate; the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n- No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions detected.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n- All reports are consistent: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 or near zero.\n- The scores match the code's characteristics.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Overall Personal Estimate**\nBased on the code and reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign, no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a benign CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected                               |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Code is straightforward and readable                         |\n| Security Risk   | 0                 | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or suspicious activity     |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, benign, and appropriate for its purpose.**",
