  "purpose": "CLI script for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, which displays information to the user.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers printing of version or info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading code identified.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package information and version. It uses command-line argument '--version' to decide whether to print version info; otherwise, it prints detailed package info. No user input is processed beyond sys.argv. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or code injections. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It contains no malware or security risks. The script appears benign and aligns with standard practices for such utilities.",
