  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code confirmation:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- It reads `sys.argv` to check for `--version`.\n- It writes to `sys.stdout`.\n- No dynamic data, external calls, or sensitive info handling.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious constructs, no malicious code observed.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no evident logical errors.\n- The functions and control flow are correct.\n- No mistakes in implementation or reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores given in reports:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0 or very close (0.1 in some reports)\n- These are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0 or near 0.\n- The code is a simple informational CLI utility, so high risk scores are unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity, no code injection, no backdoors.\n- Malware score should remain 0.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- No unwarranted claims.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- All reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- No discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Risk score:** **0** — No security risk present.\n\n**Estimated scores based on analysis:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a simple, benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. All evidence points to no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk. The reports' scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores should be **all zero** for malware, obfuscated, and risk, aligning with the actual code analysis.",
