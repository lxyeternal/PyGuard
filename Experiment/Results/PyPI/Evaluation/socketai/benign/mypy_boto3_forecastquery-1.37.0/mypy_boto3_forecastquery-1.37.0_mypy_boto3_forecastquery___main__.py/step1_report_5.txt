{
  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a package that provides information about boto3 ForecastQueryService, such as version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and outputs information via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to standard output using sys.stdout.write; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv triggers either printing version or package info; output is sent to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI tool that checks for '--version' argument to display version info; otherwise, it displays package details. No user input is processed beyond command-line args, and no external network calls, file access, or environment variable usage are present. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It solely provides static information about the package and its documentation links.",
