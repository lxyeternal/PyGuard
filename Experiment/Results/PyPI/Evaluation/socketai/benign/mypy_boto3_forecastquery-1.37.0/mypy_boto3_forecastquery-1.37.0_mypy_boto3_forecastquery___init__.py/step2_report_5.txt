  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a simple module that imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- The documentation string provides usage instructions.\n- No user input, external data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution is present.\n- The code appears to be a standard SDK interface wrapper.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Interface module with documentation and alias.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no data flow, no sinks.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Main interface for forecastquery service.\n- **Findings:** No external data input, no sinks, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, aligns with SDK design.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for forecastquery service.\n- **Findings:** No user input, no data processing, no network activity.\n- **Anomaly:** Future-dated copyright (2025).\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just a potential typo or oversight.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Interface and documentation for forecastquery client.\n- **Findings:** No data flows, no suspicious code.\n- **Anomaly:** Future year (2025), but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Standard SDK pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Interface module exposing client class.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Typical package interface.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. Given the code's simplicity, malware should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are correctly at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security risk.\n\n**Note on the scores:** The current scores are consistent with the code's benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate based on the code review.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not malicious but could be corrected for accuracy in documentation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0, if you prefer absolute certainty, but 0.1 is acceptable given the documentation anomaly)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the existing scores.**",
