  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple interface module: imports a class from a local module, creates an alias, and exports it.\n- No user input, no data processing, no network activity, no dynamic execution.\n- The code is well-structured, with documentation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The only notable anomaly is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is not malicious but might be a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of code issues:** No, the code is straightforward and does not contain any vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** None detected; all reports assign malware scores of 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports assign obfuscated scores of 0.\n- **Security risks:** The code itself does not process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.\n\n### Critical evaluation of individual reports:\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly states the code is benign, with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (a very low, possibly due to the future date).  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The low security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the future copyright date, which is likely a typo.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforwardness.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n\n- Notes the future date again, but finds no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis, highlighting no dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (due to future date).\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n\n- Confirms the code is standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly zero; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1) in some reports due to the future copyright year, which is not malicious but might be a typo or placeholder.\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The risk score of 0.1 is acceptable given the context, but if stricter standards are desired, it could be set to 0.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a benign, straightforward interface module with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only minor anomaly (future year) does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering the future date as a minor concern)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code analysis.",
