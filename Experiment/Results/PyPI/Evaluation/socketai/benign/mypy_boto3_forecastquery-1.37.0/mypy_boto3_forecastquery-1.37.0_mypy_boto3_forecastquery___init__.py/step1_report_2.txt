{
  "purpose": "This code provides the main interface for the forecastquery service, including documentation and class exposure for client interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.client' and references to class 'ForecastQueryServiceClient'. No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code assigns the imported 'ForecastQueryServiceClient' to the variable 'Client' and exposes it, which is a simple assignment flow with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The copyright date is in 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of documentation, an import statement, and an assignment to expose the 'ForecastQueryServiceClient' class. It does not process user input, read external data, or execute any dynamic code. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard package design. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a simple interface wrapper for the forecastquery service client, with no malicious code or security risks identified. It appears to be a legitimate part of a SDK or library package.",
