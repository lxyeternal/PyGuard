{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple interface for the forecastquery service, importing a client class and exposing it for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports ForecastQueryServiceClient from a local module (.client).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import of class to alias, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class, creates an alias, and exposes it via __all__. It contains no user input handling, no dynamic execution, no network calls, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no malicious or security issues. The minimal risk score accounts for the unusual future date but does not indicate any security concern.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
