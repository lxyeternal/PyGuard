{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main interface and documentation for the forecastquery service client, providing an importable client class for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module `.client`, documentation string, and the class assignment `Client = ForecastQueryServiceClient`.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines imports, documentation, and class aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package interface.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a module-level docstring with documentation and usage instructions. It imports a class from a local module `.client` and creates an alias `Client`. The `__all__` list exposes the `Client` and `ForecastQueryServiceClient` identifiers for external use. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. There are no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated code; the content appears standard for an SDK interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package interface module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes the `ForecastQueryServiceClient` for external use and includes documentation. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
