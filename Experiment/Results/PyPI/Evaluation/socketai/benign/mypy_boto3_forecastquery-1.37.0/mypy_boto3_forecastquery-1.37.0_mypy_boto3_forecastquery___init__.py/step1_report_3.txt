{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface for the forecastquery service, primarily exporting the client class for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module '.client' and the inline documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or user input present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of documentation, a versioned copyright statement, import statements, and exporting a class as 'Client'. There are no user inputs, no data processing, and no network or security-sensitive operations. The future-dated copyright might be a typo or oversight but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is a straightforward module interface with no suspicious or malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module interface for the forecastquery service client, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It primarily exports a class for external use, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
