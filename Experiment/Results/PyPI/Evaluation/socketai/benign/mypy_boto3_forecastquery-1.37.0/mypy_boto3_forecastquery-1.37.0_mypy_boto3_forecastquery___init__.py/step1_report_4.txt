  "purpose": "Provide an interface and documentation for the forecastquery service client, enabling users to interact with AWS forecastquery through a Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing ForecastQueryServiceClient from a relative module, and the inline documentation and comments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly defines and exports a client class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The only notable aspect is the placeholder copyright year 2025, which may suggest future-proofing or be a typo.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a simple module that imports a client class, assigns it to a variable, and defines export symbols. It contains inline documentation and usage examples. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or network activity occurs. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is straightforward and appears to be a standard SDK interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface module for the forecastquery service client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate access to the client class with appropriate documentation.",
