  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No code obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that this is standard, benign version declaration code.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, straightforward code, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code is standard practice for versioning and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score is appropriately low.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unfounded assumptions.\n   - All assessments are consistent with the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\nGiven the uniformity and clarity of the code, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
