  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No input sources, data processing, or external communications.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious activity are present.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate each report's reasoning and scores\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n- They note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious constructs.\n- All assign a confidence of 1 and scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n- The scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Critical evaluation of scores\n- The `malware` score is 0 in all reports, which is justified.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Note:** The comment contains a future year \"2025,\" which is unusual but not malicious or risky.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify higher scores if applicable\n- No reason to increase any scores; the code is standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Challenge any assumptions\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the reports are cautious and correct.\n- The only minor point is the future date in the comment, but it does not imply risk.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Consistency check\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment and personal estimate:\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware           | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| obfuscated        | 0                 | Clear, straightforward assignment.                          |\n| securityRisk      | 0                 | No external inputs, network activity, or vulnerabilities.  |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are: **malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0**.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which is not a security concern but could be flagged as a documentation inconsistency. However, it does not impact security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content, and poses no security risk.",
