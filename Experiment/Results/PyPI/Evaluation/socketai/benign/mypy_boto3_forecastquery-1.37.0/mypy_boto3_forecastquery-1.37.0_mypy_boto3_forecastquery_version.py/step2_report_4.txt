  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior are identified.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and standard for versioning purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - The only minor point is the mention of a future date in one comment, which is not a security concern.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `securityRisk` = 0, and `obfuscated` = 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are zero, there's no need for justification.\n   - The code is clearly harmless.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions.\n   - The assessments are based on static code analysis.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, static version assignment with no external interactions, no dynamic behavior, and no suspicious constructs. It is a common pattern in Python packages, and all evidence points to it being benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
