  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data read; the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; standard version assignment with a copyright comment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright comment and a single variable assignment (__version__ = '1.37.0'). There are no dynamic code executions, no external inputs, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious or unusual code constructs. It serves as a static version identifier with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with a copyright comment. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified, and it appears to be a benign, standard practice in Python modules.",
