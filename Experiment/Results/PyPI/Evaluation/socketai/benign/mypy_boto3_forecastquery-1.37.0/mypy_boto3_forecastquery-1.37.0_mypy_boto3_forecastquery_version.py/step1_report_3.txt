  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a variable assignment setting __version__ to '1.37.0'. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard version declaration commonly used in Python packages. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity is evident.",
