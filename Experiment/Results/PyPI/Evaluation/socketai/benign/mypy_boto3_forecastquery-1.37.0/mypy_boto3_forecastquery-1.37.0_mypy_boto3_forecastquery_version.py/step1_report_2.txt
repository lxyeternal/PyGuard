  "flows": "N/A; simple variable assignment with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a version string and a copyright notice. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '1.37.0' to the variable __version__, and includes a copyright notice. There are no external inputs, no code execution, no network operations, or other typical indicators of malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a package metadata definition without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving solely to specify the package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
