  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a copyright comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign, standard practice, and free of malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `obfuscated` score is 0 in all cases, which is appropriate.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all assessments conclude no malicious or security risk, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior is present.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - Malware score should stay at 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on observable facts, not assumptions.\n   - The only notable anomaly is a future date in one comment, which is benign and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration in Python. It poses no security threats, malware risks, or obfuscation concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Security Risk  | 0            |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
