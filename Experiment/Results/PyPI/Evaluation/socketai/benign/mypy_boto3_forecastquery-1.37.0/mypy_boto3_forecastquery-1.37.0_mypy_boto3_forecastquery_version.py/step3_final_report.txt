  "purpose": "Define the version of the package/module.",

  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from a static string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The comment mentions a future year (2025), which is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string with a copyright comment. It contains no input sources, external communication, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity. The comment's future year is noted but does not impact security. No evidence of malicious intent or security risk is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for version declaration, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
