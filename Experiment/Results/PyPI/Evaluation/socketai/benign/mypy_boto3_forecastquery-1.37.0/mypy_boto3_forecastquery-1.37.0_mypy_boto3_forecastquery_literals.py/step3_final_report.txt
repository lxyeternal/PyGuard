  "purpose": "Static type definitions for AWS service names, resource types, and regions used for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Defines string literal types for AWS services, regions, and resource types; conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions with no data flow or external input/output.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type aliases for AWS services, regions, and resource types, with a conditional import for compatibility. No dynamic behavior, data processing, network activity, or external interactions are present. The code is intended for type safety and documentation purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's benign nature is consistent across all reports, and the assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for AWS SDK type annotations. It poses no security or malicious risks, and all reports correctly identify its harmless nature. No modifications are necessary.",
