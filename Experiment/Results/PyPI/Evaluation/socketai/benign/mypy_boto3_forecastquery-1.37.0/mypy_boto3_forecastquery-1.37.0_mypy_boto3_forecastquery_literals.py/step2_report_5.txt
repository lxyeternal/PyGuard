  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess their findings, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static type definitions for AWS service names, regions, and resource types. No data flow, no external input, purely static code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (not explicitly given but implied as low)\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, benign, and serves as type annotations for AWS SDKs. No suspicious activity or malicious intent detected.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues, the score seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static nature, compatibility pattern, and lack of data processing.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower (not explicitly specified but implied)\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the code is purely static, with no external or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The score appears appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—static type definitions, no external data, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower\n- **Analysis:** Accurate assessment, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, static definitions with version-aware import, no dynamic or external data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar static type definitions, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or lower\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with prior assessments.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, static, and purely for type annotations. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the static, benign nature, a low risk score (e.g., 0.1 to 0.2) would be more precise than 0.5, but 0.5 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 for all reports — confirmed benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should be around 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal risk, but 0.5 is acceptable as a conservative default.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign static type definitions with no malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable but could be slightly lowered for risk to better reflect the very low threat level.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1–0.2 |\n\nThis detailed review confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use in production environments.",
