{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS service names, regions, and resource types for use in type annotations and static type checking.",
  "sources": "Static string definitions assigned to variables; import statements for typing modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static literals are used for type annotations only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed. The import conditionally loads 'Literal' depending on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of defining string literals for various AWS service names, regions, and resource types, with appropriate type annotations using Literal. The import statements are version-aware, conditionally importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found. The code appears to serve as a static configuration or type annotation utility without any suspicious logic or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions intended for static type checking in AWS SDK contexts. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe and appropriate for use in production environments.",
