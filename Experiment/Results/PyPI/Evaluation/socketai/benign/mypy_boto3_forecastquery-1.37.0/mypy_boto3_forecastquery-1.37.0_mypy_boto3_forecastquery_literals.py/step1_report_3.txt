  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service names, resource types, and regions for type annotations and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals assigned to variables, imported modules, and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines constants and types without processing untrusted data or performing IO operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process input or data flows, only defines static types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of static type annotations and constants. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines various string literal types for AWS services, resources, and regions. The content appears to be standard, static type definitions used for type checking and documentation. There are no functions, data processing, or external data sources. The code is purely declarative, serving as a reference for valid string literals for AWS services. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type definitions module for AWS service names, resource types, and regions. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, nor does it perform any data processing or external interactions. It appears safe and purposefully designed for type safety and documentation.",
