  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is static type definitions for AWS services, regions, and resource types. No data processing or external interactions are present. The reasoning is sound, and the conclusion that the code is benign is justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurately describes the code as static type alias definitions with no malicious behavior. The explanation about conditional imports and static literals is correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the static nature of the code, with no external data handling or suspicious activity. The description of the import pattern and type definitions aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Properly states that the code is purely declarative, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The standard compatibility pattern for 'Literal' import is correctly identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also correctly describes the code as static type definitions with no malicious activity. The reasoning about the import pattern and purpose is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of static type aliases for AWS identifiers.\n- **Malware risk:** None of the reports indicate any malicious activity. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or external calls.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** As static type definitions, the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static module defining string literal types for AWS services, regions, and resources. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and serves as a helpful utility for type safety in AWS SDK usage.",
