  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, defining string literal types for AWS services, regions, and resource types.\n- No data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` is standard for compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or backdoors.\n- The purpose is purely for type safety, code completion, and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports describe the code as static type definitions with no malicious activity, which is accurate.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical errors or reasoning flaws?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, security risk scores of 0, and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The detailed analysis correctly states that the code is a benign utility module for type annotations.\n- No false positives or overestimations are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment and justification:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- All reports agree on 0, which is justified. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- All reports agree on 0, which is justified. No obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No security risk.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code is straightforward, static, and intended solely for type safety.\n- No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the detailed reasoning in the reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS service names, regions, and resource types. It poses no security or malware risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
