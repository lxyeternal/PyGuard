  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service names, regions, and resource types for type safety and code completion.",
  "sources": "Read-only type alias definitions, standard library imports, and version check for typing import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from input to output, all are static literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static type alias definitions. The license and documentation comments are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static type annotations for AWS service names, resource types, and regions, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. It imports sys, checks version, and defines multiple Literal type aliases for various AWS identifiers. There are no inputs, data processing, or external calls. The content is purely static type definitions intended for type hinting and code assistance. No suspicious or malicious activity, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS service identifiers, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is used for type safety and code clarity in client code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
