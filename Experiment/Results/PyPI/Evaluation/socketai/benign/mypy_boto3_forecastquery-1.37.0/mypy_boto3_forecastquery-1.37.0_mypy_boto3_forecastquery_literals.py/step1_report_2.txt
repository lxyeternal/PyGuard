{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service names, regions, and resources to be used with boto3 typings.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions or typing based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior. The code mainly consists of type alias definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring describing its purpose and usage, including licensing and documentation links. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. It then defines a list of exported symbols and assigns string literal types to variables representing AWS service names, resource names, and regions. There are no functions, network operations, file I/O, or other potentially malicious behaviors present. The content appears to be straightforward type definitions for type safety and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type alias definitions used for type hinting and documentation purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It is a standard utility module intended for type annotations.",
