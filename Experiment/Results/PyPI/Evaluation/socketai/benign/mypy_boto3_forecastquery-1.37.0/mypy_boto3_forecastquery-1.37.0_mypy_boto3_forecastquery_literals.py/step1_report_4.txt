{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS service names, regions, and resource identifiers for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Python version via sys.version_info to determine import source; it also contains static literal definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, command execution, or other security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flows are static and limited to type definitions and conditional import logic based on Python version; no runtime data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The import conditional is standard for compatibility and does not involve obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining string literal types for various AWS service identifiers, regions, and resource types. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from the standard 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on the Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. There is no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing that could suggest malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward type annotation module for AWS service names, regions, and resources. It appears entirely benign, serving as a helper for type checking and documentation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
