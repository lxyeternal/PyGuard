  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a standard type annotations and client class definitions for AWS ForecastQuery, with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues, no anomalies, and the confidence is high (1).  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — all appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, emphasizing that the code is a benign wrapper around boto3, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious logic.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — the risk score is slightly above zero, but given the code is purely interface definitions, this seems marginal. Possibly a small default or placeholder risk score, but acceptable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard SDK interface, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Also describes a straightforward SDK wrapper with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — again, a minimal risk, likely due to the nature of SDK code.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard, safe client interface code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:**  \n  The code is purely a set of type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS ForecastQuery client, with no executable logic, network calls, or data handling.  \n  No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports agree on 0, which is correct given the code's nature.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All are 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-structured code.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, likely due to the default risk associated with code that interacts with external services, even if it's just an interface. Since there's no actual execution or data flow, a risk score of 0 is more appropriate. The code itself doesn't introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, safe SDK wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The scores are reasonable, but the small risk scores (0.1) could be adjusted down to 0 for consistency, given the code's nature.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely type annotations and interface definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Overall, I find the reports accurate and consistent.**",
