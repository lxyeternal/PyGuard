  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes type annotations and class definitions for the AWS ForecastQuery client. No dynamic code, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- **Findings:** Standard SDK wrapper; no anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code content. No issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correctly rated as completely safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with emphasis on type annotations and external API interaction via method signatures. Notes that methods like `generate_presigned_url` involve AWS API calls.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; standard pattern. Slight mention of `securityRisk=0.1`, possibly due to external API interaction.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The small security risk score reflects external API calls, which is reasonable. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate and conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—type annotations and client interface. No data processing or untrusted data handling.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar overview; emphasizes no data leaks or suspicious code.\n- **Findings:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The slight security risk score is reasonable given the context of API interaction, but no actual risk is present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SDK wrapper with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data processing, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to external API calls, which is reasonable and conservative.\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code content.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to external API interactions, which are expected and not inherently risky)\n\nThis code appears to be a safe, standard SDK wrapper for AWS ForecastQuery with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
