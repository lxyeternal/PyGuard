{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS ForecastQuery service, used for interacting with AWS forecasts through boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local type_defs module; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily type annotations and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Code appears standard for a boto3 client wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type annotations, exception classes, and a client wrapper for the ForecastQuery AWS service. It imports standard libraries, botocore exceptions, and local type definitions. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The class methods are primarily interface definitions with no executable logic. The code is well-structured, uses conditional imports for compatibility, and includes documentation links, indicating adherence to standard patterns. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, safe AWS boto3 client wrapper with type annotations. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use.",
