  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and class definitions for ForecastQuery client.\n- Sources: Imports from standard libraries, botocore, local type_defs.\n- Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or external effects.\n- Anomalies: None; code appears standard.\n- Analysis: The code is purely type annotations, class definitions, and documentation links. No dynamic code, network calls, or data handling.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard SDK wrapper.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Typed interactions with AWS ForecastQuery API.\n- Sources: Similar imports; class and method signatures.\n- Sinks/Flows: External API calls via boto3 methods.\n- Anomalies: None; standard patterns.\n- Analysis: No suspicious code; methods are wrappers around AWS SDK.\n- Conclusion: Benign, auto-generated or wrapper code, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — slightly above zero, but justified as a low, non-malicious SDK pattern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and client interface.\n- Sources: Imports, class definitions.\n- Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard SDK wrapper, no malicious logic.\n- Conclusion: Safe, well-structured, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: SDK client with exception handling.\n- Sources: Standard imports, type hints.\n- Sinks/Flows: No data leaks or external system effects.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical SDK interface, no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — minimal, justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Typed client interface.\n- Sources: Standard modules, type definitions.\n- Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or external effects.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard, straightforward SDK wrapper.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is a straightforward, type-annotated wrapper for boto3's ForecastQuery client.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (type annotations, class wrappers, no data processing, no network calls), a risk score of 0.0 or 0.1 is appropriate. Slightly above zero in some reports likely due to the external API interactions, but these are standard and expected.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the actual code content.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n- The code is safe, standard, and intended for SDK type safety and convenience.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting external API interaction but no actual risk)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and appropriate for use as an SDK wrapper.",
