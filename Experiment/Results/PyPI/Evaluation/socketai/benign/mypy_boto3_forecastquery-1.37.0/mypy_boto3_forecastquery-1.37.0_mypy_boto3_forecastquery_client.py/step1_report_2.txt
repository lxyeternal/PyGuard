{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the forecastquery service in boto3, facilitating typed interactions with AWS ForecastQuery API.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, typing, botocore, local type definitions); class methods and properties that invoke AWS SDK functionality.",
  "sinks": "Methods such as generate_presigned_url, query_forecast, and query_what_if_forecast that involve AWS API calls; parameters and return values that interact with external services.",
  "flows": "External input via method parameters (e.g., Params, kwargs), flows into AWS API calls through boto3 client methods, with potential data returned from AWS responses.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs; use of standard boto3 client patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code is mostly type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for a boto3 client wrapper. It imports standard libraries, conditional imports for compatibility, and defines an exception class and client class with properties and methods aligned with the AWS SDK. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The generate_presigned_url method correctly matches its AWS purpose. The client class and exceptions class are straightforward wrappers around boto3's generated types.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, auto-generated or wrapper module for boto3's forecastquery client, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is consistent with standard SDK wrapper patterns.",
