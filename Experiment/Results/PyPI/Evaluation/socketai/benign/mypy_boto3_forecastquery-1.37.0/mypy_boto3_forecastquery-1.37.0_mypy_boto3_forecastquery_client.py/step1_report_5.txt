{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with AWS ForecastQuery service using boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, typing, botocore modules, and type definitions; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; methods are mainly wrappers for AWS API calls.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows that handle untrusted inputs within this code; it primarily defines a client interface.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; code appears standard and documentation-driven.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK wrapper for AWS services, including type annotations and class definitions. It imports necessary modules, defines exception classes, and client methods that correspond directly to AWS API endpoints. There are no data processing or untrusted data handling that could lead to security issues. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or backdoors. All components seem to be straightforward API interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK interface for AWS ForecastQuery service with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is unlikely to be malicious or maliciously sabotaged, serving only as a typed client wrapper.",
