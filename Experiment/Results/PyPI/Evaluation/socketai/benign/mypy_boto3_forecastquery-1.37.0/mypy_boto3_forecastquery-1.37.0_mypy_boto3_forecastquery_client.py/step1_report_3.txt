{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS ForecastQuery service, providing a structured interface for interacting with the service.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal type definitions; class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input directly, nor does it perform network operations or data handling that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "N/A — code mainly defines types and a client interface, with no execution of data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is a straightforward type-annotated client wrapper for boto3.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and botocore modules to define a typed client class for AWS ForecastQuery. It includes conditional imports for compatibility, defines an exception class, and outlines methods for AWS service interaction, such as 'query_forecast' and 'generate_presigned_url'. No input handling, data processing, or network actions are performed directly; it serves as an interface. No malicious or malicious-sounding code constructs are detected. The code appears to be a well-structured, standard client wrapper with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious, and well-structured client interface for AWS ForecastQuery. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It simply provides type annotations and method signatures for interacting with AWS service APIs.",
