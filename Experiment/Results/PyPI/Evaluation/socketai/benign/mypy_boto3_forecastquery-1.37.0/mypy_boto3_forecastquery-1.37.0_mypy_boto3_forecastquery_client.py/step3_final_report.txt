  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for AWS ForecastQuery client, serving as a structured SDK wrapper with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, botocore, and local type_defs; class and method signatures referencing AWS SDK functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no handling of untrusted data, no network calls beyond SDK method signatures, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "Method parameters and return types define data flow, but no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward interface definitions with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely type annotations, class and exception definitions, and documentation links. It contains no dynamic code, no data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The presence of methods like generate_presigned_url and query_forecast are standard SDK features. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK wrapper for AWS ForecastQuery, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The minimal security risk scores assigned in some reports (0.1) are overly cautious; a score of 0 is more appropriate given the code's nature.",
