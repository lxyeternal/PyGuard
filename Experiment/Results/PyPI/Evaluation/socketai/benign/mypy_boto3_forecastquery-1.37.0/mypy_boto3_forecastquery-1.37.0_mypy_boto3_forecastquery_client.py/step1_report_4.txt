{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and a client interface for the AWS Forecast Query service, facilitating interaction with AWS APIs and handling exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, typing), boto3 and botocore modules, and local type definitions.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "The code defines class methods and properties that do not process untrusted data or perform data flow operations involving user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns are detected. The code is primarily documentation, type definitions, and class interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and type hints, defines exception classes mapping to botocore errors, and creates a client class with methods mirroring AWS API calls. All components are consistent with standard SDK wrappers. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code structure and imports are typical for a generated or SDK-style client, with no malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured SDK client interface for AWS Forecast Query, with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines method signatures and exception handling for interacting with AWS services.",
