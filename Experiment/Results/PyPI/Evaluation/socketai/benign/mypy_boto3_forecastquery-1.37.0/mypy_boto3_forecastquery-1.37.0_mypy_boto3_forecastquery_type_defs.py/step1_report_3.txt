  "purpose": "Define type annotations for forecastquery service data structures and request/response types.",
  "sources": "Imports, type definitions, and class declarations.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no runtime data flow as this is static type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on Python version is typical but slightly complex; no suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for type annotations and documentation purposes, importing standard modules and typing extensions based on Python version. No dynamic execution, user input handling, or external network activity is present. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns identified. The code provides structured data definitions with optional fields and proper type annotations, consistent with standard practice for SDK type hints.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured type definition module for forecastquery service data types. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for static typing support.",
