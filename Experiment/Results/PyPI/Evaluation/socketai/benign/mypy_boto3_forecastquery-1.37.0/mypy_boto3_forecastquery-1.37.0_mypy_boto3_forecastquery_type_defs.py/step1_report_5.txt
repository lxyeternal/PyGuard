  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for forecastquery service interactions in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, typing, and typing_extensions; class definitions; module metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, external connections, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely type definition structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports; standard practice for compatibility, no malicious intent observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines TypedDict classes for request and response data structures used in forecastquery service. It imports standard modules and conditional typing imports for compatibility across Python versions. No code executes untrusted data or interacts with external systems. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign type definitions and compatibility handling with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward, standard implementation of type annotations for a boto3 service module.",
