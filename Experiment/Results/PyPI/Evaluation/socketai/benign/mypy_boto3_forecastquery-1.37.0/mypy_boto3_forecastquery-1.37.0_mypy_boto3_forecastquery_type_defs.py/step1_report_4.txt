  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for forecastquery service API responses and requests.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, collections.abc, typing_extensions, and type definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "Data definitions and type annotations do not process untrusted input directly; no runtime data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code is primarily type annotations and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system version info to conditionally import typing modules, defines TypedDict classes for structured data, and includes documentation comments. There are no functions executing data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to serve as type definitions for a library or SDK, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions and documentation for a Python library related to forecast querying. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The structure and content suggest it is safe and intended for type hinting purposes.",
