  "purpose": "Type definitions for forecastquery service, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, and class definitions; no user input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; primarily static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports based on Python version; no unusual or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, following standard practices. No external data sources, user inputs, or sensitive operations are present. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be solely for type hinting and documentation purposes, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. It serves as a static schema for type annotations.",
