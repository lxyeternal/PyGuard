{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for forecastquery service data structures, primarily for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info checks, type alias definitions, class definitions for data types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static type annotations and documentation references are safe and standard.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily consists of type definitions and conditional imports with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code structures or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type definitions for forecast query responses and requests, with conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It includes documentation and copyright info but no dynamic or untrusted data handling. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious logic are present. The structure and content are typical for a type stub module intended for static type checking. No signs of obfuscation or malware are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for a boto3 forecastquery service, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
