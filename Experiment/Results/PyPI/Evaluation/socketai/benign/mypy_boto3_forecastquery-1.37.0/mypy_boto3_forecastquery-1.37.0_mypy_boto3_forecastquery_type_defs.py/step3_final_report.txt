  "purpose": "Type annotations for forecastquery service type definitions, providing static type hints for SDK users.",
  "sources": "Code reads static type definitions, imports, and conditional compatibility logic; no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static type annotations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only type definitions used at static analysis time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard conditional imports for compatibility, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The code is well-structured, documented, and adheres to standard practices for type stubs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's purpose is purely for static type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of static type definitions for the forecastquery service, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its static, non-malicious nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent.",
