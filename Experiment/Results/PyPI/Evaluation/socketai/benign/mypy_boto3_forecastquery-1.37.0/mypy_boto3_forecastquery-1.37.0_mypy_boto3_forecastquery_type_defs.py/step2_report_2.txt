  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code and the claims made, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static type stub module for the forecastquery service, primarily defining TypedDict classes for request and response data structures.\n- It uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility.\n- There are no dynamic operations, data processing, network calls, or user input handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n- The code includes documentation and licensing info, consistent with open-source SDK type definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code defines type annotations for forecastquery, with no external data or user input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious constructs; conditional imports are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is benign, serving as type hints with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Reasonable.**\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar scope.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of conditional imports is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; focuses on static type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code structures.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Justified.**\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of sys.version_info for compatibility is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that this is a benign, static type stub module.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None. All reports are consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code is purely for static type annotations with no dynamic or malicious components, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly zero; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** None made; all claims are based on the code's static nature.\n- **Score consistency:** All reports are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard type definition module with no security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Work through completed.**",
