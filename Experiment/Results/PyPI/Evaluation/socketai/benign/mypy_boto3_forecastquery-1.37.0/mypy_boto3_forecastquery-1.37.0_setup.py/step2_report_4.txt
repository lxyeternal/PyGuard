  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the script as a standard Python setup configuration.\n- No external or untrusted input sources are involved.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code only reads a static README file and calls `setup()` with hardcoded metadata.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- The code is static and adheres to typical packaging standards.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original, and all reported elements are present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; all reports agree on benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to current date (October 2023). While unusual, this is not malicious or security-related, just a potential inconsistency or typo.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. Given the analysis, this is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the static code analysis.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on speculation.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The only point to consider is the copyright year \"2025,\" which might be a typo or oversight, but it does not impact security.\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the scores as-is.\n- No further action needed; the package appears secure and benign.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
