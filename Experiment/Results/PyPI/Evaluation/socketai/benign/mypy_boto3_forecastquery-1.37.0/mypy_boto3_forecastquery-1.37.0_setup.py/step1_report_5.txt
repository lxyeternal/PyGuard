  "purpose": "This setup script is used for configuring the packaging and distribution of the mypy-boto3-forecastquery Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description; imports 'Path' from pathlib; imports 'setup' from setuptools; reads version, author info, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows, no external network or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code performs static setup configuration without data flows that pose security risks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The license and author information are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It reads a local README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, and calls 'setup' from setuptools. No external inputs, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious functions or data flows. It does not perform any network communication, data manipulation, or system modifications beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. No security risks or malware indications are present. It is a typical, well-structured package configuration script.",
