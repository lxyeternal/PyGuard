{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-forecastquery package, used to configure and install the package with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package and metadata definitions; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no runtime execution of external data or commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script primarily defines package metadata and static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. No use of eval, exec, or insecure functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration file. It imports necessary modules, reads a static README file, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All data appears hardcoded and static, with no external input handling or data flow that could be exploited. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. The code adheres to typical packaging standards and does not perform any runtime operations beyond static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and purely for package configuration. It contains no malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling that could pose a security risk.",
