  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-forecastquery, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual copyright year '2025', which may be a typo but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is safe, benign, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
