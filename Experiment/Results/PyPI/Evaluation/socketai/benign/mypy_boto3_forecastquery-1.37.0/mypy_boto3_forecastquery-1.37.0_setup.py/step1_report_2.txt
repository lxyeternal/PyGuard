  "purpose": "The script sets up the Python package 'mypy-boto3-forecastquery' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data is being sent or executed from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reads package description from file → passes static data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The copyright year is set to 2025, which might be inconsistent with current or typical dates, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, reads a markdown file for the description, and calls setup() with static parameters. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. The package data and dependencies are statically defined. Overall, the script appears to be a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely performs package configuration tasks with static data. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.",
