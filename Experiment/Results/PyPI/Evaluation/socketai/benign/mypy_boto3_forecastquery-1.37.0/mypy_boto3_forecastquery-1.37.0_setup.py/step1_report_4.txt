{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package called 'mypy-boto3-forecastquery' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static data within setup() call for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external system effects observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard setup script with benign dependencies and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. All dependencies are from trusted sources, and no hardcoded secrets or sensitive information are detected. The script adheres to typical package configuration practices without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
