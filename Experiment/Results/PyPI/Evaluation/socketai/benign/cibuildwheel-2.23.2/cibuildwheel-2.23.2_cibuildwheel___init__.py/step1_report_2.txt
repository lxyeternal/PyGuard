  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only metadata declarations; no suspicious or unusual code activities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a future import statement to enable features from a future Python version and a version string assignment. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a standard module header or metadata declaration with no malicious intent or malicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a module metadata declaration with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
