  "purpose": "Define the future behavior of annotations and specify the version of the package",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data movement observed",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only imports and version string; no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__.annotations to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, which is a standard feature in Python 3.7+ to allow forward references. The __version__ string indicates package versioning. There are no suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated elements present. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are identified. The code appears to be boilerplate or initial setup code common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
