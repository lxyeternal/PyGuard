  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as minimal, consisting solely of a `__future__` import and a version string assignment.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- The code is standard boilerplate, serving as metadata or module setup.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated elements are present in any report.\n- All confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The original code snippet matches the description: it contains only `from __future__ import annotations` and a `__version__` string.\n- No additional code, data handling, or logic exists that could introduce security risks.\n\n**Potential issues or errors:**\n- None of the reports identify any issues with the code.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate: the code is standard boilerplate with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**Challenge assumptions:**\n- Since the code is trivial and well-understood, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities that need to be challenged.\n- The reports correctly dismiss any malicious or obfuscated potential.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are justified at 1 given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is standard boilerplate, posing no security threat. No further action or concern is necessary.",
