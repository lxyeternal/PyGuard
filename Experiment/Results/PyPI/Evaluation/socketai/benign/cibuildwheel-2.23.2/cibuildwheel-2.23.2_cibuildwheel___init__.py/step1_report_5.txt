{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a future import for annotations and defines a version string, likely as part of a package or module metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output operations are visible.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed. The use of __future__ import is standard and harmless; the version string is typical metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting only of a future import statement and a version string assignment. No data input, output, or external calls are present. The use of __future__ import is benign and common in Python 3.7+ codebases for compatibility purposes. The version string indicates package versioning. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is benign, standard boilerplate code for a Python package or module. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation. The overall security risk and malware likelihood are very low.",
