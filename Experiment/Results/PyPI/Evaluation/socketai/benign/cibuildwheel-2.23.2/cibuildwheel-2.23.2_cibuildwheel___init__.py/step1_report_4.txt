  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies observed; use of __future__ import is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of an import statement from __future__ and a version string assignment. The import is for future compatibility features, which is common and not suspicious. The version string indicates package versioning. No other logic, data handling, or potential malicious actions are present.",
