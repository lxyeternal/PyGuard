  "purpose": "Minimal Python module snippet importing __future__.annotations and defining a version string, serving as boilerplate or metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code does not process untrusted data or perform data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a feature flag for postponed evaluation of annotations, which is standard in Python 3.7+, and sets a version string. It contains no external data sources, sinks, or malicious logic. The minimal structure indicates boilerplate or module metadata. No suspicious or obfuscated elements are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature. Confidence is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only standard boilerplate elements with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
