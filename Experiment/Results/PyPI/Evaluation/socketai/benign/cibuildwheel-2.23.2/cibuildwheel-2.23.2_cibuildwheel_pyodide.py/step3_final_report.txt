  "purpose": "Build automation and environment setup for cross-platform Python packages targeting Pyodide and Emscripten, including dependency management, wheel building, and testing.",
  "sources": "Downloads from GitHub (emsdk.zip, pyodide xbuildenv), environment variables, configuration files, command outputs.",
  "sinks": "System commands executed via 'call' and 'shell', file operations (download, extract_zip, move_file), environment variable modifications, file writes for test setup.",
  "flows": "External URLs and configs feed into downloads and environment setup; commands and file operations process these inputs; environment variables influence build and test steps.",
  "anomalies": "External SDK downloads from official sources; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; use of file locks and controlled command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build setup, dependency installation, wheel building, and testing routines for pyodide/Emscripten environments. External resources are from reputable sources like GitHub and pyodide.org. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Command executions are controlled and predictable. The environment handling and file operations follow best practices. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) accounts for reliance on external URLs but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured build automation tool for cross-platform Python environments, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. External dependencies are from trusted sources, and the code is transparent. The low security risk score reflects standard build environment considerations.",
