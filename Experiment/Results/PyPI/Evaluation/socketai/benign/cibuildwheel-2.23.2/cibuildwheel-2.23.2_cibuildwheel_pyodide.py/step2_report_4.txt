  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes that the code is a build automation script with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation. It notes external downloads, environment setup, and testing routines, all standard for such scripts.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code downloads SDKs from trusted sources, uses locking, and runs commands in controlled environments. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident. The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the external dependencies and command execution, which are typical in build scripts.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build and environment setup routines, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code reads configs, downloads dependencies, and executes commands in a controlled manner.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. External downloads are from official URLs, and command executions are standard. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The risk score remains low, reflecting typical build environment concerns.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is described as a build automation tool for cross-platform Python environments, with no signs of malicious activity. It downloads SDKs and dependencies over HTTPS, executes commands, and manages environment variables carefully.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The very low risk score (0.1) is justified, given the reliance on external URLs from known sources and standard command execution.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** The script automates environment setup, wheel building, and testing, involving downloading from trusted sources like GitHub. It performs environment isolation, runs commands, and manages dependencies.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The only minor concern is reliance on external URLs, but these are from reputable sources. The low risk score reflects typical build process concerns.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages dependencies, environment setup, and build steps with no signs of malicious intent. It downloads from known sources and executes standard commands.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score is justified given the controlled environment and reputable sources.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code performs external downloads, environment setup, and command execution, but nothing malicious is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is justified. The code is clear, modular, and uses explicit paths and commands.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are appropriate given the external dependencies and command executions typical in build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, typical for build scripts with external dependencies.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and their scores are justified. The code appears to be a legitimate build automation script with no malicious intent.",
