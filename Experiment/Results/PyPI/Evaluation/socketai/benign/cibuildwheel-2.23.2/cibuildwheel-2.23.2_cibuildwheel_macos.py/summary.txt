  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and testing script for macOS Python wheels. It involves external URL downloads and subprocess execution, which could be exploited if URLs are malicious or inputs are manipulated. However, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate, around 0.2 to 0.4, mainly due to external inputs and command execution. Proper validation and source control of URLs would mitigate these risks further."
