  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven build automation script for cross-platform Python package building. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Its main risks stem from external dependencies and network operations, which are standard for such tools but should be maintained from trusted sources. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but inherent risks associated with executing external commands and downloading files."
