  "purpose": "Automates setup, build, test, and installation of Python environments and wheels across multiple architectures.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, environment variables, URLs for downloads (nuget.org, GitHub ZIPs), filesystem operations.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands (call, shell), downloads, filesystem modifications, environment variable settings.",
  "flows": "Sources include URLs and environment variables; sinks include subprocess executions and file operations; flow is straightforward and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious control flow or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build automation tasks: downloading external tools, setting environment variables, executing subprocess commands, managing filesystem locks, and handling cross-compilation setups. URLs are from reputable sources, subprocess commands are straightforward, and environment management is explicit. No malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The external dependencies are well-known and trusted. The security posture is typical for build scripts, with low inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven build automation script for cross-platform Python package building. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Its main risks stem from external dependencies and network operations, which are standard for such tools but should be maintained from trusted sources. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but inherent risks associated with executing external commands and downloading files.",
