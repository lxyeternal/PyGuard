  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured build automation system for Python packages in containerized environments. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate."
