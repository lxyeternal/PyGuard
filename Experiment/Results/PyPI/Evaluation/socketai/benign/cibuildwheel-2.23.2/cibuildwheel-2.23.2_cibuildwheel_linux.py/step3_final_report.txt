{
  "purpose": "The code manages containerized build, test, and repair workflows for Python packages, orchestrating environment setup, wheel building, testing, and output collection within OCI containers.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (read_python_configs), container commands (call, copy_into, glob), environment variables, build options, and user-provided commands.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to container commands, file system operations within containers, environment variable modifications, and wheel file movements.",
  "flows": "Configurations are read and filtered based on architecture; container images are selected; commands are executed inside containers for building, testing, and repairing wheels; outputs are copied back to host.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of subprocess and container APIs aligns with standard build orchestration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard containerized build workflows, including environment setup, wheel building with pip or build, optional repair, testing in virtual environments, and output collection. All subprocess calls are controlled and based on configuration data. No malicious or obfuscated code patterns are present. The logic is straightforward, with appropriate error handling and validation. No signs of sabotage, covert channels, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured build automation system for Python packages in containerized environments. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
