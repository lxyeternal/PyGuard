  "purpose": "Configuration management for a Python build system, handling environment variables, config files, and CLI arguments with validation and merging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, configuration files (e.g., defaults.toml, pyproject.toml), command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "None; primarily parsing, validation, and logging without executing untrusted code or network activity",
  "flows": "Sources (env vars, files, CLI args) -> Validation/merging functions -> Final configuration objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive configuration parser and validator for a build tool, using standard libraries and safe parsing methods. It performs validation, merging, and logging, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with its purpose and implementation, reflecting typical configuration handling risks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured configuration management module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are justified. No further security concerns are indicated.",
