  "purpose": "Define platform constants, type aliases, and a protocol for Python configuration",
  "sources": "Imports os, subprocess, and typing modules; reads type hints and class property",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.Popen to potentially execute subprocesses",
  "flows": "Code may invoke subprocess.Popen with untrusted input (not shown explicitly here)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases and constants related to platform identification. It conditionally assigns subprocess.Popen based on type checking, but does not invoke it directly. The Protocol class defines a property 'identifier' without any implementation or side effects. The code does not perform any I/O operations, external communications, or dangerous actions. No unusual patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup for platform and configuration management with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
