  "purpose": "Define type aliases, constants, and a protocol for Python platform configuration",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and constant definitions",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted data sources or execution of external commands",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines types and constants",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines type annotations, constants, and a protocol class. It uses conditional typing for type hints. There are no functions executing untrusted data or external commands. The code appears purely structural, serving as a type and constant definitions module. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type and constant definitions module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
