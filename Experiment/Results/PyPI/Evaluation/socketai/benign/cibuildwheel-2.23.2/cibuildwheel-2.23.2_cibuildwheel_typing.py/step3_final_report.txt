{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases, platform constants, and a protocol for Python configuration, serving as a structural setup module.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (`os`, `subprocess`, `typing`) and assigns type aliases and constants; no data input sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external command executions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only sets up types and constants without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign setup defining platform names, type aliases with conditional typing, and a protocol. It imports modules but does not execute commands or handle untrusted data. The subprocess import is only used for type annotations, not invocation. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. The scores assigned by the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate; the minor risk score could be lowered to zero given the absence of active risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks. The original assessments are accurate; only the risk score should be adjusted downward to 0 for precision.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
