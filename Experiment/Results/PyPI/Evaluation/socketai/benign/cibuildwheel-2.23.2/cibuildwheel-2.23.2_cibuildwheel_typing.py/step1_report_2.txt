  "purpose": "Define type aliases, constants, and a protocol related to platform and subprocess handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Reading module attributes (__future__, os, subprocess, typing), type hints, and string literals.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up type definitions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines type aliases based on type checking, declares constants for platform names, and defines a protocol with a property. No runtime data input, network operations, or file manipulations are present. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' and type hints are standard and do not pose security risks. The structure and syntax are typical for a type-annotated Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, with no malicious intent or security issues. It mainly provides type definitions and constants for a larger project. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
