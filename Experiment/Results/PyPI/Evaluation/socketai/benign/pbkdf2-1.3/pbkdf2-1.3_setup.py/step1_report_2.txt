{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the pbkdf2 Python package for distribution, including metadata and configuration for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ from the pbkdf2 module, importing setup functions from setuptools or distutils, and accessing package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; setup configuration is static and intended for package distribution.",
  "flows": "Importing __version__ from pbkdf2, then passing static metadata into setup() with no runtime data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; fall-back warning message is standard practice. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup functions from setuptools, falling back to distutils if unavailable, which is standard. It retrieves the module version from pbkdf2.__version__, assuming this attribute is safe and static. The setup() call includes metadata about the package, with no user input or untrusted data involved. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network access, system modifications, or obfuscated constructs, is present. The script appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely handles package metadata and installation configuration.",
