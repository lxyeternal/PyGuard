  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python setup script for packaging the pbkdf2 module.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n- The use of __version__ from the module is common practice.\n- The fallback to distutils with a warning is standard.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code appears correct and typical for a setup script.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets or external data sources.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0.\n- These are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- No issues are present that would justify a higher risk score.\n- The scripts are standard package setup scripts.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- No network access, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on straightforward code analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No further action needed.\n- The package setup code is benign and poses no security risk.",
