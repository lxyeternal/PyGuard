  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The script is a standard Python setup script for packaging the `pbkdf2` module.\n- It conditionally imports `setuptools` or falls back to `distutils.core`.\n- It retrieves the version from `pbkdf2.__version__`.\n- It calls `setup()` with static metadata such as name, description, author, URL, classifiers, and long description.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious logic:** None.\n- **Use of untrusted data or dynamic code execution:** No.\n- **Obfuscation or hardcoded secrets:** No.\n- **Malware activity (e.g., malicious code, backdoors):** No.\n- **Security risks (e.g., code injection, data leaks):** No.\n\n### Issue Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the script is a typical setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The retrieval of `__version__` from the module is standard practice, assuming `__version__` is a static string defined in `pbkdf2`.\n- The fall-back to `distutils` with a warning is common and safe.\n- No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation are observed.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports give 0, which is accurate.\n- **Malware:** All reports give 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports give 0, justified by the straightforward nature of the script.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified by the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- No discrepancies found. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports correctly identify the script as a typical setup configuration.\n- No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The code poses no security threat based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The scores and assessments are appropriate; no further action needed.",
