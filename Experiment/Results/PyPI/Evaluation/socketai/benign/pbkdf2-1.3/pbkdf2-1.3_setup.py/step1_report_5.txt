{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pbkdf2 Python module, intended to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'setuptools' or 'distutils.core', and the '__version__' variable from 'pbkdf2' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Importing '__version__' from 'pbkdf2' and passing it to setup; no external data flow or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' for package setup, falling back to 'distutils' if unavailable. It then imports '__version__' from the 'pbkdf2' module to specify the package version. The setup() function is called with typical package metadata, including name, modules, description, author info, URL, classifiers, and a long description. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The code appears to be a conventional Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any anomalies or malicious intent.",
