{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the pbkdf2 Python module, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from pbkdf2 module, reading setup configuration, reading metadata like author and URL.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data leaks or unsafe operations present.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code observed. Use of standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports setuptools or falls back to distutils for setup, which is a common pattern. It retrieves the module version from __version__ within pbkdf2, then calls setup() with metadata about the package. All code appears to be straightforward package configuration without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical packaging tasks without any anomalies or malicious intent.",
