  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the pbkdf2 module, defining metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Import of __version__ from pbkdf2 module, static metadata fields in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ to setup() call, static data used in configuration",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; standard fallback to distutils",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python setup script that attempts to import setuptools, falling back to distutils with a warning. It retrieves the version from pbkdf2.__version__ and calls setup() with static, predefined metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or handling of untrusted data. The use of __version__ is standard, assuming the module's version attribute is safe. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging patterns indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The overall assessment is consistent and justified.",
