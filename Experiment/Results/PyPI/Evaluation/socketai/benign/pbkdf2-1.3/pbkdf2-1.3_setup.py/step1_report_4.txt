  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the pbkdf2 Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools/distutils and __version__ from pbkdf2 module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup configuration is static and does not handle external input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setuptools for package setup; if unavailable, it falls back to distutils. It then retrieves the package version from the pbkdf2 module and calls setup() with static metadata. All code appears to serve the purpose of package configuration. No external data handling, user input, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
