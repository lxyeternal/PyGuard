{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the pbkdf2 Python module for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own version from the __version__ variable in the pbkdf2 module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in critical operations; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "The __version__ from pbkdf2 is used as the package version; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' and falls back to 'distutils' if unavailable, issuing a warning. It imports the __version__ attribute from the 'pbkdf2' module to set the package version. The setup() function is called with static metadata, including package name, description, author info, and classifiers. No dynamic or untrusted data handling is present. The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module, with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for the 'pbkdf2' module, with no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
