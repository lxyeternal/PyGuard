  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the pbkdf2 module.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is observed.\n- The code relies on importing __version__ from the pbkdf2 module, which is a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, dynamic code execution, or suspicious data flows.\n- The reported issues (malware, obfuscated code, security risks) are correctly identified as absent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n### Errors or Flaws in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 is correct; no vulnerabilities or risks are introduced by this script.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The reliance on `__version__` from the pbkdf2 module is standard practice, assuming the module's version attribute is safe and static.\n- No external inputs or untrusted data are involved.\n- The fall-back to distutils is a common pattern and does not introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The code poses no security threat, and the analysis correctly reflects that.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports and scores are accurate, and no further action is needed.",
