  "purpose": "A unit test suite verifying the correctness of pbkdf2 and crypt functions using known test vectors from RFC 3962 and other sources.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test inputs within the test functions, including passwords, salts, and expected outputs.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing computed results to expected values; no external data, network, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded) -> cryptographic functions -> assertions to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard cryptographic test suite that uses static, hardcoded test vectors to verify the pbkdf2 and crypt functions. It contains no external data sources, no network activity, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. All assertions are internal and verify expected cryptographic outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The code's structure and purpose are consistent with legitimate testing routines. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and justified based on the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured cryptographic test suite with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues. It contains no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly set to zero.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
