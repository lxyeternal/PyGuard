{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for IVS service types, used for type checking and validation in Python SDK or client code.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, collections.abc, typing, and internal type definition files; data initialization for TypedDict structures.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code primarily defines data structures and type annotations without executing or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; the code only declares type definitions and constants, with no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for a Python SDK, including TypedDict classes, type aliases, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling is present. The code appears to be purely declarative, serving as type hints and data schemas for the IVS service. No indicators of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, benign type annotation module defining data structures for the IVS service. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is solely used for type checking and does not process or handle untrusted input.",
