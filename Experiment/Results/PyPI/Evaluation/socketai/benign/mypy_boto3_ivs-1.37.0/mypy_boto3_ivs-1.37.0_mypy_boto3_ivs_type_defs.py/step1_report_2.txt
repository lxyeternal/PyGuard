{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for IVS (Interactive Video Service) service type definitions, primarily for static type checking and documentation purposes in a Python SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Sources include imported modules (sys, datetime, typing), and data inputs via type annotations in TypedDict classes and functions (e.g., environment variables or function parameters).",
  "sinks": "Sinks involve usage of data structures (dicts, lists, sequences) that could potentially handle untrusted input, but no direct data processing, I/O, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data inputs (e.g., API responses, user data in request objects) through type-annotated structures, but no untrusted data processing or external commands are executed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely type definitions with no executable logic, no code injection mechanisms, and no handling of external untrusted input. The only unusual aspect is the inclusion of the copyright notice and documentation string, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data structures using TypedDict, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. It does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external interactions. All data sources are data definitions, and no sinks involve untrusted external code execution. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. The presence of standard type annotations and documentation suggests this is a library definition module, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for an IVS SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears to be a legitimate SDK type declaration module for static type checking, documentation, and API data structure definitions.",
