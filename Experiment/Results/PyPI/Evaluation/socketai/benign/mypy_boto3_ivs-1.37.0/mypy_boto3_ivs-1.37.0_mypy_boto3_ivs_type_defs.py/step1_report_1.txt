{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for IVS (Interactive Video Service) service types, primarily used for API request and response payloads in a Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local literals module; static type definitions including constants, request/response dicts, and complex data types.",
  "sinks": "None evident; data structures used for defining API contracts, with no direct data processing, input handling, or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows from sources to sinks; code consists solely of type definitions and static annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; structure follows standard type definition patterns for SDKs.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of TypedDict and Union definitions for request and response structures, conditional imports based on Python version, and explicit __all__ declarations. No functions, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. All elements are consistent with standard SDK type annotation practices. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated segments. The code appears to be a generated or manually crafted set of type definitions to facilitate API interactions, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of static type definitions for a Python SDK and contains no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It is a benign, structured data schema intended for API contract enforcement.",
