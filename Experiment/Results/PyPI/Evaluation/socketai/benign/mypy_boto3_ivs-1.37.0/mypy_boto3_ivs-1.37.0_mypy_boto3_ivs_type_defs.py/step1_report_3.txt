{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for IVS service type definitions to facilitate static type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, and constant definitions; primarily reading from sys.version_info, standard libraries, and local literals.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that execute untrusted data; type definitions do not include data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Type annotations define data shapes but do not specify runtime data flows or untrusted data pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code uses standard type annotation practices and conditional imports based on Python version, which are common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type definitions and conditional imports to support multiple Python versions. There are no functions executing runtime code, no network operations, or data handling logic that could be malicious. The import of 'sys' and conditional import logic based on 'sys.version_info' is standard for compatibility. The module only defines data structures using TypedDict and type annotations, which are safe and intended for static analysis. No signs of obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type definitions and imports for a Python SDK related to IVS, with no indication of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured, and safe type declaration module intended for static type checking.",
