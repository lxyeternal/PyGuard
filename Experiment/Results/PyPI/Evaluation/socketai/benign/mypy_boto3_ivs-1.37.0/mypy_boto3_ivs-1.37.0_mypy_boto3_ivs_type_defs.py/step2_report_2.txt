  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report to identify any inconsistencies, overestimations, or signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of static type definitions for an SDK, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No functions, runtime logic, external data processing, or I/O operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be generated or manually written for API contract enforcement and static type checking.\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for IVS SDK types; sources are standard imports and literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flow; purely static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Fully aligned with typical SDK type definitions. No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; focus on static type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No unusual patterns; benign use of conditional imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a type declaration module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus; defines data structures for SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No execution or data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, only standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions, no external data sources involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of conditional imports and extensive type annotations, which are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely declarative, safe, and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; static type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis and Recommendations\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code. **Set at 0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward type annotations. **Set at 0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, benign nature, the risk is negligible. **Set at 0**.\n\n**However,** considering the possibility of false positives in automated tools, but given the evidence, I concur with the current assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Estimate:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Malware           | 0      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      |\n| Security Risk     | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for an SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is safe and benign.",
