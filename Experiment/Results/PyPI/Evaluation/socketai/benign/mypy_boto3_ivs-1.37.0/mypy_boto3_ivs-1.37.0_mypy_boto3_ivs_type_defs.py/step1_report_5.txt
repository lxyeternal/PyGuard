  "purpose": "Type definitions for IVS service data structures and request/response types used for API interactions.",
  "sources": "No direct sources of untrusted input; primarily type annotations and static data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code solely defines data types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static type definitions without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version; no suspicious code behavior or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of TypedDict class definitions, constants, conditional imports for compatibility, and docstrings. No runtime logic, input processing, or external data handling is present. All code appears to serve as static type hints for a Python SDK or library. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are evident. The structure and content align with standard API type definitions, indicating a focus on static type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, providing type annotations for an IVS SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code's purpose is to support type checking and code clarity, with no runtime execution or data manipulation observed.",
