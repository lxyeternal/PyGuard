  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, anomalies, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static type definitions for an IVS SDK.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified.\n- Conditional imports for Python version compatibility are standard and benign.\n- The code appears to be either generated or manually crafted solely for API schema enforcement and static type checking.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Presence of malicious code or anomalies:**\n\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The code strictly contains type annotations (`TypedDict`, `Union`, type aliases) and import statements.\n- No functions, I/O operations, network calls, or data handling that could be exploited.\n- The inclusion of copyright notices and documentation strings is benign.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, as the code is purely static type definitions with no runtime or external interactions.\n- **Confidence:** Very high (1.0 or close), as the analysis is thorough and consistent.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent across reports.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report supports the conclusion that this is benign SDK code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports:**\n\n- The code is a benign, static set of type definitions for an SDK.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n- The high confidence levels are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and data schemas for an SDK, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such static type definition modules are not accompanied by hidden code elsewhere, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe and legitimate.",
