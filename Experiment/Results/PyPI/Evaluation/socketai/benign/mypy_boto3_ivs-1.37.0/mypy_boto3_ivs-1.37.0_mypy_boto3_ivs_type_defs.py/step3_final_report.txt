{
  "purpose": "Static type annotations and data structure definitions for the IVS SDK, intended for static type checking and API schema enforcement.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, conditional compatibility code, and literal definitions; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data processing, external data flows, or untrusted data sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only provides type hints and data schemas without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Use of conditional imports for compatibility is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of TypedDict definitions, type aliases, and conditional imports to support multiple Python versions. It contains no functions, runtime logic, network calls, or data handling. All signals point to a static, benign SDK type declaration module. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the structure aligns with standard API schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of static, well-structured type definitions for an SDK, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments are consistent and justified.",
