  "purpose": "CLI tool for displaying package information and version details for boto3 IVS 1.37.0",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (writes package info and version), potentially command-line input",
  "flows": "Command-line input (e.g., '--version') triggers output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded credentials; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution present",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments to determine whether to output version information or package details. It writes output directly to stdout. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and only involves printing static information. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a CLI utility to display static package information and version. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is simple, clear, and safe.",
