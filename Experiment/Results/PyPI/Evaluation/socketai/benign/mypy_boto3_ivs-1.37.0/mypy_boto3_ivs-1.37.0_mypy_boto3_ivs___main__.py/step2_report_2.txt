  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward CLI utility that prints static package info or version based on command-line argument '--version'.\n- No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data manipulation, no untrusted input handling beyond argument parsing.\n- The code is simple, static, and does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, which aligns with the code content.\n- The only minor point is the copyright year \"2025\" — possibly a placeholder or future date, but not inherently suspicious or malicious.\n- No issues are detected with the logic, reasoning, or summaries.\n\n**3. Review of scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is benign, static, and straightforward.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports agree on no malware, obfuscation, or security risk, and the code is static and simple, raising risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware score justification:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, does not include obfuscated code, nor interacts with external systems.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports correctly identify no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The only questionable point is the future year in the copyright, but that’s irrelevant to security.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple CLI script with static output.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The consistent scoring across reports supports this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The overall risk assessment should remain at zero, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**  \n\nThis aligns with the code’s straightforward, benign nature.",
