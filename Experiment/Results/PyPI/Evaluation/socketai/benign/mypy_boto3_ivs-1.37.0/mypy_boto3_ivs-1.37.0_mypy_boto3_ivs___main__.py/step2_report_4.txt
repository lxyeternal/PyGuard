  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info and version based on command-line arguments.\n- The actual code matches this description: it reads `sys.argv`, outputs via `sys.stdout.write`, and has no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent: all correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and safe.\n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The only minor point is that the copyright year 2025 is in the future, which could be a placeholder or typo, but not a security concern.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No risk scores are above 0.5; all are 0, indicating no security risk.\n- This aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume no malicious intent or hidden payloads; this is correct.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic or suspicious operations.\n- The only point to consider is the future date (2025), but this is likely a placeholder or a typo, not malicious.\n\n**Step 6: Check for consistency**\n\n- All reports are consistent: they correctly interpret the code, assign appropriate scores, and identify no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static information based on command-line arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall risk assessment aligns with the evidence.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**.",
