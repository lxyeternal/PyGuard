{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point that outputs package information and version details to the user.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs data using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write is used to display information, which is generally safe. No untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (--version) triggers print_version(), which outputs version info. Otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that provides package info or version details based on user input. It only reads command-line arguments and outputs static strings. No data from untrusted sources, external network calls, or sensitive data handling is observed. The code's simplicity and static nature suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely as a CLI interface for displaying package metadata.",
