  "purpose": "This code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point for a package, providing version and package info output.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to standard output (sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv flows into main(), which conditionally calls print_version() or print_info(), then writes to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Functions are straightforward and only perform informational printing.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to print package info and version, triggered by command-line arguments. No data is read from or written to external sources besides standard input/output. The code is simple, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. No external network connections or sensitive data handling are present. The copyright date is 2025, but this appears to be a placeholder or a future date, not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point for displaying package information, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
