  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`)",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output (`sys.stdout.write`)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (source) to output functions (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The copyright year 2025 is future-dated but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that prints static information. It reads `sys.argv` to determine whether to print version or package info, then writes to stdout. No external data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code is static, simple, and contains no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The future date in the copyright is likely a placeholder and not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
