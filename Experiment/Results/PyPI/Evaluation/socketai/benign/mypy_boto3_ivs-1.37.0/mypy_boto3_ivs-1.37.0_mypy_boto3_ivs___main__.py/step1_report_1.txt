  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; outputs data via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no external data sinks or network communication.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, print_info() is called to write package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward I/O operations without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple functions for printing static information to standard output. It reads command-line arguments to determine whether to print version or package info. There are no external data sources, network operations, or data manipulations involving untrusted input. The structure and content are typical for CLI scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility for displaying static package and version information. It does not contain malware, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, purpose-driven script with no security concerns.",
