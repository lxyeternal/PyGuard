  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'mypy-boto3-ivs', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description, and various static strings and data from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is written or sent over network, nor is there execution of external code based on input.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script only reads static files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. All data appears static and controlled. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or network activity is present. The script follows typical setup.py structure with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
