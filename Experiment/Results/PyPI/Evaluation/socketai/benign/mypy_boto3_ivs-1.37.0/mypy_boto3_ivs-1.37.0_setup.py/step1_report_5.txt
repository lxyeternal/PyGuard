  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-ivs package to configure installation parameters and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; static string literals in setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is transmitted, injected, or processed from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data used is static or file-based during build time.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behavior. The license and URL fields are standard; no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static setup configuration, reading a markdown file for description, and defining package metadata. It imports only standard library and setuptools functions. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains no malicious or suspicious activity. It is a standard package configuration script with no signs of malware or security risks.",
