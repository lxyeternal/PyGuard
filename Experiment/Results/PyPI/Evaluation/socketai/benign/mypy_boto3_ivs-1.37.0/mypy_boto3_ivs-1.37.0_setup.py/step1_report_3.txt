  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-ivs package, used for package configuration and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of README.md file, imports 'Path' from pathlib, and 'setup' from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "The script primarily performs package setup; it does not contain sinks that execute untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md content (source) and passes configuration data to 'setup' (sink), but no data flow involves untrusted sources or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious external code execution, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the README.md file, defines package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() with this metadata. It does not process external input dynamically or execute untrusted code. The code is well-structured, uses standard package setup practices, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It safely performs package configuration tasks.",
