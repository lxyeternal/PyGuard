{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up and configure the packaging of the Python module 'mypy-boto3-ivs'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports from pathlib and setuptools; static metadata such as package name, version, URL, author info, description, classifiers, keywords, project URLs, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to or transmits data; no untrusted input is processed or output generated.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is static and based on predefined metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code follows standard setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup using setuptools, reading a README file for long description, defining package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It does not process user input, execute code dynamically, or interact with external systems during runtime. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python module. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The script is standard and safe.",
