  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-ivs module, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; static metadata and package data defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file reading and static parameters into the setup() function; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, reads a local README.md file, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. There are no dynamic inputs, code execution, or network operations. The script is a typical setup configuration with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. The scores are consistent with the code's static, well-structured nature. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a legitimate, safe, and standard package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All evidence points to a benign, well-formed script suitable for production use.",
