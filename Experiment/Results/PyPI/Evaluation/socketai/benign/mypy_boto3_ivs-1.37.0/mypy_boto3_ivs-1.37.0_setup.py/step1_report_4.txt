{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-ivs package, used to configure the package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description; reads setup parameters and package data; imports from pathlib and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for package description; passes fixed configuration data to setup() function; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard libraries and defines package configuration parameters. It reads a markdown file for the long description, then calls setup() with static and well-defined arguments. There are no dynamic or untrusted data sources, no network operations, and no code execution beyond the standard setup process. The code is straightforward and conforms to common Python package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It safely configures package metadata and dependencies.",
