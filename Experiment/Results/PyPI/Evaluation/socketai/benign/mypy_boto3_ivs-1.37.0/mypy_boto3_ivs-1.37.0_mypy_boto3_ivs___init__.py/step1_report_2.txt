{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) SDK, importing client classes and paginators for interacting with AWS IVS services.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; mainly module setup and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a simple interface module that imports classes and functions from other local modules and re-exports them. It includes a documentation string and a copyright notice. There are no functions, input/output handling, or runtime data processing. The import statements suggest modular organization but do not execute any operations that could be malicious. The usage example in the docstring is for user reference and does not execute during import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module that defines an interface for IVS-related classes and functions. It does not contain any malicious code or security risks. The structure and content are typical for a Python SDK interface module, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
