{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and documentation for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) client, including importing and exposing relevant classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator). No external input or untrusted data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports classes and assigns one class to a variable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The copyright date is 2025, which is in the future but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports specific classes and functions from local modules, defines a Client alias, and exports symbols. It includes a detailed docstring with example usage and documentation link. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no credentials, or network operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign, standard interface setup for an IVS client library, with no malicious intent, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks detected.",
