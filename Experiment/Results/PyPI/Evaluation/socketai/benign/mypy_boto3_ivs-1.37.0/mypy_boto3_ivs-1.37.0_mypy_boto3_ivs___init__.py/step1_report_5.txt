{
  "purpose": "To provide a main interface module for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) client, allowing users to instantiate and access various paginator classes for AWS IVS service.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), static string for documentation and copyright",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present",
  "flows": "N/A; code only imports and defines constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and module export patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes from local modules and exposes a Client alias and __all__ for exports. It contains a descriptive docstring with usage examples, which are static and safe. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present, such as hidden backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated code. The structure and content are typical for a Python SDK wrapper or interface module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign interface module designed to facilitate usage of the IVS AWS SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
