{
  "purpose": "Provides a static interface for the IVS SDK, importing classes and defining exports.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (.client, .paginator), documentation string.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static imports and variable assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025), but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports SDK components, assigns an alias, and defines __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The documentation provides usage examples but does not execute code. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static SDK interface module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
