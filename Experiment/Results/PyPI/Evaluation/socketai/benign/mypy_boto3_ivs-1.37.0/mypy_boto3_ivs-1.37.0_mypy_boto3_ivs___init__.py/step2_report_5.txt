  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a simple Python module that imports classes from local modules (`.client` and `.paginator`), assigns an alias `Client` to `IVSClient`, and defines `__all__` for exports.\n   - It contains a docstring with usage instructions, including example code.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external input handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is primarily organizational, serving as an interface or wrapper for the IVS SDK components.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No external data sources or inputs are processed.\n   - No network activity, code obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or environment variable manipulations.\n   - The copyright year is set to 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious.\n   - The code is static and does not execute any logic beyond imports and variable assignments.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward interface setup with no external inputs or outputs.\n   - The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.\n   - The confidence level is high (1.0), and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 is justified; no security vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year (2025), which might be outdated but not malicious.\n   - The code does not handle any user input or external data, so no injection or data manipulation risks are present.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations**:\n   - The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n   - No changes are necessary; the code is safe and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a benign, straightforward interface module with no security concerns.",
