{
  "purpose": "Main interface module for the IVS service, providing imports, documentation, and aliases for the IVS client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the embedded documentation string.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted data sources; the code primarily defines imports and constants.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from external sources; the code only sets up class aliases and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright year set to 2025, which may be outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a documentation string and import statements establishing a module interface for an IVS client. It assigns the imported IVSClient class to a generic name 'Client' and exposes several paginator classes via __all__. No data input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code does not handle user input, environment variables, or network connections directly. It primarily acts as a wrapper or interface for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for organizing imports and documentation; there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only minor concern is the outdated copyright year, which is not malicious.",
