  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on the code's security implications, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of the scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports classes and defines exports. There are no signs of code execution, dynamic code, network activity, or data handling.\n   - The code contains only import statements, variable assignments, and documentation strings.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Security Risk:**\n   - Since the code is purely a module setup with no data processing, input handling, or network activity, the security risk is minimal.\n   - The reports assign a security risk score of 0, which seems justified.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Anomalies:**\n   - The only minor anomaly noted is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date. This is not malicious but could indicate outdated or placeholder information.\n   - No other anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code, are present.\n\n5. **Scores Consistency:**\n   - The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical SDK interface module with no security issues.\n   - The documentation and code structure do not suggest any malicious intent.\n   - The risk scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's actual content and behavior. No further action or concern is warranted based on this review.",
