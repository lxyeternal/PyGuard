  "purpose": "Main interface for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) SDK wrapper, providing access to the IVS client and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator); no external or user input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data outputs or network connections.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports, type aliasing, and defining __all__ for exports. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of untrusted data. The purpose appears to be setting up the SDK interface. No security issues or malicious behavior are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as a public API interface, with no suspicious or harmful components.",
