  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple module that imports classes, defines an alias, and exports symbols.\n- No external data sources, user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The copyright date is set to 2025, which may be outdated but is not malicious.\n- The code serves as an interface or wrapper for the IVS SDK, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual issues in the code. The code matches the description of a straightforward SDK interface module.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** The reports are consistent; no logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware score: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n  - Security risk: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code does not handle untrusted data or perform operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- The risk and malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The reports' confidence is 1.0, indicating certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The only minor point is the copyright year 2025, which might be outdated but not malicious.\n- No claims of hidden malicious behavior are made, and none are supported by the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured interface module for the IVS SDK, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
