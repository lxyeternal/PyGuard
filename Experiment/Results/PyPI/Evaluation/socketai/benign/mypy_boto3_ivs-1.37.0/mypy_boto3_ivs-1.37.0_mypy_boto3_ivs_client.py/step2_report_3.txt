  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and client interface for IVS SDK.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It is a type-safe wrapper for AWS API calls.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (low).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code content, which is mainly class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations. No runtime logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; focuses on type annotations and class definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external input, untrusted data, or malicious behavior detected. The code is a standard SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is a set of type annotations and method signatures, with no signs of malicious activity. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on type annotations, class, and method definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code is a straightforward SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports; the code is a typical SDK stub with no malicious intent. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, describing type annotations and interface definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No untrusted data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns. The code is a static interface with no executable logic.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code content, which is purely type annotations and method signatures. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, defining client interface with type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No executable logic, data leaks, or suspicious patterns. The code is a standard SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is consistent with a safe SDK stub. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that the code contains no malicious behavior. The code is purely structural, with no runtime logic, network activity, or data processing.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports find obfuscated or intentionally obscured code. The code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a very low risk score (0.1 or 0), which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a set of type annotations and interface definitions for a boto3 client for AWS IVS.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The code's purpose is to provide type safety and API structure, which it does transparently.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, safe SDK interface with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments needed.",
