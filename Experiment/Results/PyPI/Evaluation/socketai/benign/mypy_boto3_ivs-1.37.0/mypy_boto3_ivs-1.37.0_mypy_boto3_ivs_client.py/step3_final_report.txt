{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS IVS client SDK, providing static type hints for method signatures, exceptions, and paginator access without executing runtime logic.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions, type annotations, imported modules, and exception classes; no input/output handling or external data processing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks; purely static interface code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code does not perform runtime operations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code; purely structural SDK interface.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, class definitions, method signatures, and exception types for the IVS SDK. It does not include executable logic, data handling, or network interactions. The code is well-structured, standard for SDK type stubs, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature as a static interface layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It poses minimal supply chain security concerns, serving purely as a static type annotation layer for the IVS client. The scores and assessments across the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
