{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) client in boto3, providing structured API interaction for AWS IVS.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules, class and method definitions, property and overload declarations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions detected; methods are primarily API wrappers with type annotations.",
  "flows": "Method signatures with parameters unpacked from specific request types, returning various response types; no data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns found. The code strictly defines API client interfaces and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured type-annotated Python class for AWS IVS client. It includes necessary imports, class inheritance, property definitions, and method signatures aligned with AWS SDK practices. No signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic. The use of type annotations and overloads is typical for stubs and does not indicate malicious intent. All elements appear to serve the purpose of API interaction and type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, security-conscious SDK interface definition for AWS IVS, with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It adheres to standard design patterns for SDKs and stubs.",
