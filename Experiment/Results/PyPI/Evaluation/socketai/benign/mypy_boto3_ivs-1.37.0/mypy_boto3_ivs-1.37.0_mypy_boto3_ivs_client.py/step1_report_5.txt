  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) SDK client, facilitating interaction with AWS IVS via boto3.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, third-party modules (botocore, typing_extensions), and type definitions; class and method definitions including properties and overloads.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code does not execute external commands, handle sensitive data, or perform network connections directly.",
  "flows": "N/A. The code defines an interface and types; it does not contain runtime data flows or untrusted data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly defines a client interface with type annotations and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class and method declarations with type annotations, imports, and docstrings referencing AWS SDK documentation. It uses conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility, and overloads for pagination methods. There is no executable logic, data processing, or network activity within this snippet. All methods are interface definitions meant for a client wrapper, and no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type annotation and interface definition for the boto3 IVS client, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a well-structured API client interface with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
