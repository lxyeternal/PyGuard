{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) AWS SDK, providing type-safe access to IVS API methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it primarily defines classes, methods, and type annotations for interacting with AWS IVS service APIs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist that process untrusted data; methods are wrappers around AWS API calls, returning responses or creating paginators. No data leakage or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "flows": "The code establishes a client interface with method signatures corresponding to AWS IVS API operations; data flow is from method calls to AWS services, not within the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hard-coded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code primarily consists of type annotations and class/method definitions. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden functionalities identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type-safe wrapper around the AWS IVS SDK, including method signatures, property definitions, and paginator overloads. It imports standard libraries and AWS SDK modules, with conditional imports for compatibility. No external input handling or untrusted data processing is present. The structure is consistent with SDK type definition files, aiming to facilitate static type checking. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK interface with extensive type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK type definition for the AWS IVS service with no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. It serves as a type-safe interface for AWS SDK calls and contains no signs of malware or security risks.",
