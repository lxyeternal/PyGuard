  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) client in boto3, including method signatures, exception types, and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore modules, and local modules; class and method definitions; docstrings; type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or file I/O are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Method signatures with type annotations define data flow; no runtime logic or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code primarily consists of type annotations and interface specifications.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a type stubs and interface layer for the IVS client, including exception definitions and method signatures with type hints. It imports standard libraries and third-party modules safely, with no indication of data manipulation, network activity, or obfuscated code. The methods only specify signatures and docstrings linking to official documentation, without executable logic or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a structured interface definition for the IVS boto3 client with type annotations. It contains no executable or malicious code, no data leaks, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. It appears to be a safe, well-structured stub for type checking and documentation purposes.",
