  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: code presence, potential anomalies, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and interface for IVS SDK; sourced from standard imports and class/method definitions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is purely structural, aimed at type safety.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate SDK interface, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0, security risk minimal (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard, safe SDK stub with no malicious intent. The low security risk is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—type annotations and client class definitions for AWS IVS.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No untrusted data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code is a typical SDK type definition.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, safe SDK interface, with full confidence (1), malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. No issues detected; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, SDK interface with method signatures, exception types, etc.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code is a standard API client definition.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, safe, standard SDK code, high confidence (1), malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly interprets the code as a benign SDK stub, with appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and interface for IVS client.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no data processing, no suspicious patterns. It’s purely interface definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, safe, well-structured. Confidence is high (1), malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK client interface with type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No executable logic, no data leaks, no obfuscation. The code is a standard API interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, with no signs of malicious activity. Confidence is 1, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct interpretation; the code is a typical SDK stub.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as purely structural, type annotations, and interface definitions.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external execution.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a set of type annotations and SDK interface definitions for AWS IVS, with no executable or malicious components.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the SDK interface nature, but not a security risk in itself)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scores are appropriate, and I agree with the reports' findings.",
