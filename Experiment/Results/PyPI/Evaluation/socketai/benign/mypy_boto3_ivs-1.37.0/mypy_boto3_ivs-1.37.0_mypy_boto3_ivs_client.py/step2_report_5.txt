  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and client interface for IVS SDK. No execution or untrusted data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The code is purely structural.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully aligns with expectations for a type stub; high confidence (0.95). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the report.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining type annotations and client class. No external input or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is a static interface.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and interface for IVS client, no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1). The code is a standard SDK interface.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, method signatures, no untrusted data handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Interface definitions, no execution logic.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1). No malware or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports indicate zero, consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All zero, aligning with the straightforward, non-obfuscated nature of the code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the code is purely structural and intended for type annotations.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score reflects the nature of the code as a static type stub.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since supply chain issues are minimal, but always worth noting in supply chain contexts)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action required.",
