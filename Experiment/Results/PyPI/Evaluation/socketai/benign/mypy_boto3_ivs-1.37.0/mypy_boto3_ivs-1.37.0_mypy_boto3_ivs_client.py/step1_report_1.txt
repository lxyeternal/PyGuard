{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definition for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) SDK, providing structured access to IVS API operations with type hints.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class and method definitions; properties and overloads for paginator creation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no execution of untrusted data, no network activity, or system modifications are directly present.",
  "flows": "Method definitions with type annotations describe expected input/output data types; no dynamic code execution or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of type annotations and property decorators are standard. No obfuscated or dynamic code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for a boto3 client for the IVS service, defining class structures, exceptions, method signatures, and overloads for paginators. All components follow standard patterns for SDKs, with no signs of malicious code, secret leakage, or unusual behaviors. The code is purely structural, aimed at type checking and API interfacing, with no runtime execution logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SDK interface with no malicious intent. It serves as a type-safe wrapper around IVS API calls, with no evidence of sabotage, malware, or security risks.",
