  "purpose": "Static type annotations defining string literals for AWS services, resources, and configurations to enhance type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "No data input, external data sources, or dynamic code; only static literal definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of conditional imports for Python version compatibility and extensive static Literal definitions for AWS resource and service names. It contains no executable code, data processing, network activity, or secrets. The purpose is to serve as a static type stub for better type checking and documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS resource identifiers with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is safe for use in static type checking contexts.",
