  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service configurations and identifiers for type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string literals to variables; no external data input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code consists solely of type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Python's Literal for AWS-related identifiers, adapting for different Python versions. It imports and conditionally uses 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. All definitions are static string literals assigned to variables, used for type safety and documentation. There is no dynamic execution, user input processing, or external data reading. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS service identifiers. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and serves purely as a type annotation utility. No security risks or malware concerns are identified.",
