{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS services, resource names, and related categories for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, and the assignment of Literal types for constants.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily consists of static type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from string literals into type annotations; no untrusted data processing or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is purely declarative, defining type literals.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on Python version, then defines a series of Literal type aliases representing various AWS resource and service names. There are no dynamic or executable code paths, no user input handling, no network operations, or other behaviors that could be malicious. It is a straightforward static type declaration module. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely provides type aliases for AWS service constants, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard for type hinting purposes.",
