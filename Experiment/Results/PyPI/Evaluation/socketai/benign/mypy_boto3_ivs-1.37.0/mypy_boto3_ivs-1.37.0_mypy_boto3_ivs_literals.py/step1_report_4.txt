{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS IVS service and related AWS services, for use with type annotations in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "The code reads only static string literals assigned to variables; no external input or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or can cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as the code involves only static type definitions without data flow or input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is straightforward and only defines string literal types. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS IVS and other AWS services using Literal types. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice. The content consists solely of static string definitions for type safety and documentation purposes. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign, well-structured type definition module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for static type annotations of string literals related to AWS services. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The structure and content are consistent with a standard type stub file intended to improve type checking and documentation support.",
