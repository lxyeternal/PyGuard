  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS IVS service and related resource identifiers to ensure type safety and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code only declares constants and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data flow from input to output; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as the code only defines static literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is purely type annotation declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to conditionally import 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions', which is standard for compatibility. It then declares multiple constants as 'Literal' types representing fixed string values for various AWS service identifiers and configurations. The extensive list of string literals appears to serve as type annotations for AWS SDK interactions, ensuring type safety. There are no data inputs, dynamic executions, or suspicious logic present. The code strictly serves as type definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS service string literals, with no malicious activity or security risks. It primarily enhances type safety in a Python codebase interacting with AWS services.",
