  "purpose": "Define type literals for IVS service and various AWS resource identifiers for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and defining constant literals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified. No dynamic execution or data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present. The code is a straightforward set of type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliasing for various AWS resource and service names using Literal types, with conditional importing of the Literal type based on Python version. It includes a comprehensive list of literals for different resource names and configurations. No data input/output, network activity, or code execution present. The structure and content are consistent with standard type definitions intended for static type checking. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely for type annotation purposes, defining literals for AWS resource and service names. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. The code appears safe and intended for static type checking support.",
