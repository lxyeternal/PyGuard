  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS IVS SDK, providing type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance from Paginator, 'paginate' methods accepting **kwargs for request parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external network calls; 'paginate' methods pass kwargs to underlying AWS SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow into 'paginate' methods, which invoke parent class methods with these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static set of class definitions for boto3 IVS paginators, primarily serving as type annotations. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present. The use of **kwargs is typical for SDK wrappers and does not introduce security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and adheres to expected patterns for such SDK extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from the acceptance of untrusted kwargs, which is standard in SDK wrappers and does not constitute a security concern.",
