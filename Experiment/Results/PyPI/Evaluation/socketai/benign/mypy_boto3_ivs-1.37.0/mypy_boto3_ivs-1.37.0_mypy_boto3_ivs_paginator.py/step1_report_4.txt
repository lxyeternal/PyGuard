{
  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) client in boto3, facilitating pagination over IVS API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data processing points identified; no network or file system access; no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Code primarily establishes class hierarchies and method signatures for paginators; no actual runtime data flow or data manipulation shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code is well-structured and standard for boto3 stub definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for paginators with type annotations, extending from base Paginator classes. It conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version, which is typical. The paginate methods are properly typed, and the code includes documentation links. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. No external data sources, network access, or command execution occurs within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for boto3 IVS paginators. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It serves purely as type hinting and class structure for pagination functionality.",
