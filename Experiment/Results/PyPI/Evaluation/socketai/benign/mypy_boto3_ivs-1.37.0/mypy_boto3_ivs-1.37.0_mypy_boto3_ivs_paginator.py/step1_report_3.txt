  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for AWS IVS service client, providing type-safe paginated API calls.",
  "sources": "Imports of boto3 and botocore modules, type definitions from 'type_defs', and class methods 'paginate' that accept unpacked request parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept untrusted keyword arguments and return 'PageIterator' objects; no sinks involve untrusted data being used insecurely or maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to 'paginate' methods flow into 'Unpack' types, then into 'PageIterator' return objects; no evident malicious data flow or suspicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of 'Unpack' for type hinting is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with type annotations, including 'paginate' methods that accept unpacked request parameters and return paginated results. All class definitions and methods follow standard patterns for boto3 stubs. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Use of 'Unpack' and type definitions is consistent with typing practices. The code relies on external libraries for actual data handling, with no suspicious inline logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured type annotation module for boto3 IVS paginators. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks are evident. The implementation is standard and focused solely on providing type hints and class structures for pagination.",
