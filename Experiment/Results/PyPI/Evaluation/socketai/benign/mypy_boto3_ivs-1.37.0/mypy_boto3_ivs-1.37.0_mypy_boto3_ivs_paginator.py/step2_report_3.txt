  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining type annotations and paginator classes for AWS IVS, matching the code's structure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or external network calls are present; the flow is limited to method parameters passing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is straightforward class inheritance with type annotations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion is accurate; the code is legitimate, with high confidence (1). Malware and obfuscation are correctly scored as 0.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar observations as Report 1. The code is boilerplate, standard class inheritance, with proper type annotations.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is reasonable given the repetitive pattern.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 is acceptable, as the code handles untrusted kwargs but does not process them insecurely.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Same pattern: class definitions for paginators, no malicious behavior.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Again, standard paginator class definitions, no suspicious code or obfuscation.  \n- Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Similar to previous reports; no malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) is appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of paginator class definitions with type annotations, wrapping boto3 functionality.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors in any report.\n- **Risk scores:** Appropriately low; the only minor concern is the acceptance of untrusted kwargs, which is standard for SDK wrapper code, not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 — acceptable, given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is legitimate, standard boilerplate for AWS SDK type annotations, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review above.",
