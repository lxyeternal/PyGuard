  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS IVS, sourced from standard libraries and type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input data flows from **kwargs** into the paginator's `paginate` method, which is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The code is straightforward class inheritance and method wrapping.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, legitimate SDK/stub code with high confidence (1), no malware, no security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound; the code is standard and safe. The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type annotations and class definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The `paginate` methods accept untrusted **kwargs** and pass them to the parent class.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, just boilerplate code for type safety.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also legitimate, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is reasonable given the similar context.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no malicious indicators. The security risk score (0.1) is acceptable, reflecting minimal concern over untrusted input, which is typical for such SDK wrappers.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—type annotations, class definitions, and use of **kwargs**.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same as above, passing **kwargs** into the paginator.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, with confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous reports; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with conditional import based on Python version.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, standard code, high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo concerns; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on type annotations and paginator classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input **kwargs** passed into API calls, typical for SDK code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with a confidence of 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll consistent; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe standard, boilerplate paginator class definitions for boto3 IVS SDK, with type annotations for safety.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors in any report.\n- **Security Risks:** The only potential concern is the acceptance of **kwargs** in `paginate`, which is typical for SDK wrappers. While untrusted input could theoretically be misused, in this context, it's standard and expected.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the context, a risk score of **0** is appropriate. The code is standard SDK stub code, not executing any untrusted or malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Final note:** The code is legitimate, intended for type safety and SDK usage, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but the malware and obfuscated scores should be **0** for all.\n\n---\n\n**Work through completed.**",
