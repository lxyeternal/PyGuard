  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the IVS service client in boto3-stubs, facilitating type-checked pagination over IVS resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class methods that call the parent paginate method.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods, which accept arbitrary keyword arguments and pass them to the parent paginate, potentially untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to paginate methods flow into the parent class's paginate implementation; no explicit data sinks or network calls in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard usage of type annotations and class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with proper type annotations, leveraging conditional imports for compatibility with Python 3.12+ and older versions. The paginate methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments unpacked from specific type definitions, then pass them to the parent class's paginate. There are no network calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors in this isolated code. No malware or malicious intent is evident; the code appears to be boilerplate type annotation and class extension code for boto3 pagination.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3 IVS client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate type-stub implementation to facilitate type checking.",
