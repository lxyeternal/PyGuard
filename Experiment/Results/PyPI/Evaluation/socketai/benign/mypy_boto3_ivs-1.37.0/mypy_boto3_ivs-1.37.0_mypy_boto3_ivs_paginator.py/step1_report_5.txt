{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the IVS (Interactive Video Service) client in boto3, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module's type definitions (`type_defs`), system version info (`sys.version_info`), and the method parameters passed to the `paginate` methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could originate from the `kwargs` in `paginate`, but these are intended to be user-supplied parameters for API calls, not malicious input. No external untrusted data sources or outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data in `kwargs` flows into the `paginate` methods and interacts with the `PageIterator` objects, which generate paginated responses. The data is not used in any dangerous manner such as code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code uses standard type annotations, conditional imports, and class structures consistent with boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-safe paginator classes for the IVS client, employing standard Python typing and conditional imports based on Python version. No external or untrusted data sources are used, and the flow is limited to API parameter passing and response handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication to unknown hosts, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate set of type definitions and wrapper classes for AWS SDK pagination.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 IVS client. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of the boto3-stubs project aimed at enhancing type safety for AWS API interactions.",
