{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the AWS IVS service client, enabling paginated API calls with proper type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and botocore.paginate; type definitions imported from .type_defs; class method 'paginate' with **kwargs for parameter unpacking.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs which are unpacked into API call parameters, potentially untrusted; no direct data sinks or external network calls are made within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the **kwargs in 'paginate' methods to the call to the underlying Paginator's 'paginate' method, which then yields PageIterator objects containing response data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class inheritance for paginators; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or backdoors; the 'paginate' methods override parent methods but only wrap standard behavior with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines typed paginator classes for the IVS service, with methods that wrap existing boto3 paginator 'paginate' calls, providing type safety via type annotations. No external data sources, network connections, or malicious code behaviors are present. The structure is consistent with standard SDK usage, with type definitions and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious control flow. The code's purpose is clear, and it relies entirely on established libraries and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured, type-annotated paginator classes for AWS IVS, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of an SDK or type stubs setup, focusing solely on type safety and documentation.",
