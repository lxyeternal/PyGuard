  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, reasoning, and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes type annotations and class definitions for IVS paginators, with standard imports and type defs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs which are passed to the underlying paginator; no external data sinks or malicious flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is straightforward class inheritance and method wrapping.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is legitimate, with high confidence. No malware or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on type annotations and class inheritance.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same as above; the 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs, which are passed to the parent paginate method.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard boilerplate code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malicious activity, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly elevated but still very low; perhaps considering the use of **kwargs, but no real risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—type annotations, class inheritance, standard usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accepts untrusted input via **kwargs, but this is standard for pagination parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code; no obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no security risks.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (again, very low, considering the use of **kwargs)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; no deviations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity; input parameters are for API calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; type annotations for paginators.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Input via **kwargs, typical for boto3 pagination.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in some reports due to the use of **kwargs, but this is standard and not risky.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for the boto3 IVS client, primarily serving as type annotations and wrappers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of **kwargs is standard for such API wrappers and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the potential for untrusted input via **kwargs, but this is standard and not inherently risky)\n\nThis code is a legitimate, benign part of a type stub or SDK extension for AWS IVS, with no security concerns.",
