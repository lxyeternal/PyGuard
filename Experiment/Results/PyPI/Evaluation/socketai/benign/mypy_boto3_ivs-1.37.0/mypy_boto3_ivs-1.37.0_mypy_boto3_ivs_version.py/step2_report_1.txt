  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. All reports agree that there are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - The only noted anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to current dates. This is not inherently malicious but could suggest outdated or intentionally future-dated metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The mention of the future copyright year as an anomaly is appropriate; it does not indicate a security flaw.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No report indicates a risk score above 0.5, and given the code's simplicity, this is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or dynamic execution that could pose security threats.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious code snippets.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions; all assessments are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional Remarks:**\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year \"2025,\" which does not pose a security risk.\n- The code is a standard, benign version declaration.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately assess the code as benign. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, standard version declaration with no security concerns.",
