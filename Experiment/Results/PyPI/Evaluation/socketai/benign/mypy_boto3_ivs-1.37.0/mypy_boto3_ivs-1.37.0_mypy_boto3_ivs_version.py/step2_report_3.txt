  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data leaks.\n   - The code contains only a comment and a variable assignment, which is standard practice for version metadata.\n\n2. **Anomalies & Potential Risks:**\n   - The only noted anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date. This is not inherently malicious but could suggest outdated or incorrect metadata.\n   - No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is identified across all reports.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious elements.\n\n4. **Assessment of Claims & Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and metadata-only.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n   - The future copyright year is not a security concern.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and reasonable.\n   - No modifications needed based on the evidence.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security issue.\n- The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
