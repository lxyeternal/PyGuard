  "purpose": "Define the version of the package with a static string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static code with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year '2025' noted, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string, with a comment header. No dynamic behaviors, inputs, outputs, or obfuscation are present. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. Confidence in benign nature is high (1). No suspicious or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not affect security. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
