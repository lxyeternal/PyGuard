{
  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module as a string variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data outputs or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright year '2025' which may be inconsistent with the current date, but this is not inherently suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple metadata declaration, setting a version string. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The only notable aspect is the copyright date '2025', which is in the future relative to current known dates, but this alone is not indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic version declaration with no malicious behavior or security issues. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not pose a security risk.",
