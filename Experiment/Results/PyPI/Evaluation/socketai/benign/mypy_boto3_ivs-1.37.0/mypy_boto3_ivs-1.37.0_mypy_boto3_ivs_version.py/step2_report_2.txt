  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"1.37.0\"`).\n   - No external inputs, dynamic code, or data flows are present.\n   - No sinks or data leaks are identified.\n   - The code is standard practice for package versioning.\n\n2. **Anomalies and potential issues**:\n   - The only noted anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to current dates. This is not inherently malicious but could suggest outdated or placeholder metadata.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores assessment**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - Given the benign nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Logic and reasoning errors**:\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no logical flaws or assumptions that could lead to false positives.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities that are unsupported by the code.\n\n5. **Potential improvements**:\n   - The only minor point is the future copyright year, which might be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Overall risk estimate**:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign and serves as metadata for a package.",
