  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No external inputs, dynamic code, or data leaks are present.\n   - The only notable anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to current dates, but this is not inherently malicious or suspicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is static, simple, and metadata-only.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made.\n   - The assessments are cautious and appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, static version declaration with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year \"2025,\" which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is entirely benign. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to scores are necessary. The overall security posture is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
