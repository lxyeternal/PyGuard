  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version assignment, no suspicious behavior or code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a single assignment of a version string to the '__version__' variable, which is common practice in Python packages. There are no inputs, outputs, external data reads, or suspicious constructs. The comment at the top indicates source information but is not executable or malicious. No malicious or malicious-sounding code, backdoors, or unusual behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
