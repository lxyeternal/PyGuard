  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\"",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output involved",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input to output processes",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward version declaration with no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a docstring comment and a single variable assignment for __version__, which is a common practice for version tracking in Python packages. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and does not exhibit any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security issues. It is safe and serves its purpose as a version source reference.",
