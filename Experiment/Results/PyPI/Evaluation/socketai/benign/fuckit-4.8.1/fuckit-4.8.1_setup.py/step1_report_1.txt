  "purpose": "To set up and package the Python module named 'fuckit' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; reads package files via os.path functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content for description, then proceeds with standard package setup flow.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'fuckit' is unusual and potentially unprofessional, but no malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and standard libraries, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. No code injection, network activity, or credential handling is present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python module. The package name might be considered inappropriate, but this does not indicate malicious intent. No hidden code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The only concern is the choice of package name, which is unprofessional but not malicious.",
