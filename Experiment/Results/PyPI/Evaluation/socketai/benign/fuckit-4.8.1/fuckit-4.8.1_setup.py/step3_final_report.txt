  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for packaging a module named 'fuckit'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network calls, or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Read static file -> setup() call with metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unprofessional package name 'fuckit', but no malicious or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script importing standard libraries, reading a static README.md file, and invoking setup() with package metadata. No code injection, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The package name is unprofessional but not security-related. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The only concern is the package name, which does not impact security but may be unprofessional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The unprofessional package name does not constitute a security issue. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
