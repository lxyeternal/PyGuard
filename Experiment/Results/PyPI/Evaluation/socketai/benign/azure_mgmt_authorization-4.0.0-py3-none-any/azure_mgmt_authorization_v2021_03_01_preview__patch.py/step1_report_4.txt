{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a template for customizing generated SDK code, primarily providing a placeholder function for user modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the module import statements and the function definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or can lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing typing and defining an empty list, with a placeholder function for customizations; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and boilerplate in nature.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal boilerplate template intended for customization in SDK development. It imports only standard typing, defines an empty __all__ list for module exports, and provides a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' for user customizations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it include any external network calls or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate SDK customization template with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides structure for future modifications and has no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
