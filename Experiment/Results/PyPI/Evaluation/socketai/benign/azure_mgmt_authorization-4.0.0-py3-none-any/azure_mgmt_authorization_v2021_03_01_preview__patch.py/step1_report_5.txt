  "purpose": "The code appears to be a template or stub for customizing generated SDK code from Microsoft, likely part of a larger SDK or code generation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports standard typing and defines a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines a no-op function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal template with a function intended for custom SDK modifications. It imports only standard modules, defines a list for exports, and includes a placeholder function with documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is straightforward and serves as a customizable template for SDK users.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK template with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious activity or anomalies.",
