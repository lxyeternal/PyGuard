  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal template for SDK customization, including licensing comments, an import statement (`from typing import List`), an empty list `__all__`, and a function `patch_sdk()` with no implementation.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, external data reads, network calls, or embedded secrets.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and intended for user modifications.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or signs of malware.\n   - No code execution, data handling, or external input processing.\n   - The purpose is clearly to serve as a placeholder for SDK customization.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently identify the code as a benign, boilerplate template with no security issues.\n   - They emphasize the lack of data flows, sinks, anomalies, or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's content.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly set to 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Correctly set to 0; no vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues detected. The code is a standard SDK template.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the reported scores.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a safe, boilerplate SDK customization template with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
