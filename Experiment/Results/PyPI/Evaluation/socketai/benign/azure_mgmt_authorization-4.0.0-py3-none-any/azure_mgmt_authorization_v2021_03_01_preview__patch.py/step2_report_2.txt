  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization, containing licensing comments, an import statement, an empty list `__all__`, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()`.\n   - There are no external data sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded secrets or network calls.\n   - The code is static and purely structural, intended for user modifications.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code does not perform any operations beyond defining a function and a variable, and contains no suspicious code constructs.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Data Flows**:\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No external inputs, outputs, or network activity.\n   - The code does not handle or process any data; it is a scaffold.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All assign 0, as there's no security vulnerability or risky behavior.\n\n5. **Any Inconsistencies or Concerns?**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code's purpose is clearly stated as a placeholder for customization, with no malicious or insecure elements.\n\n6. **Potential for Reassessment?**\n   - Given the simplicity and the absence of any suspicious elements, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n   - No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is a benign, boilerplate template with no security issues. It serves as a safe scaffold for user customizations in SDK development.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and no further action or concern is necessary.",
