  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**  \n   - The code is a straightforward template for SDK customization, containing only licensing comments, import statements, a variable declaration, and a placeholder function (`patch_sdk`).  \n   - No dynamic code, data handling, or network activity is present.  \n   - The code does not read external input, write output, or perform any operations beyond defining a structure for future user modifications.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**  \n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n   - The code is minimal, boilerplate, and intended for user customization without embedded secrets or dynamic execution.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Data Flows**  \n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.  \n   - No external inputs or outputs are involved, reducing the attack surface.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**  \n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.  \n   - The security risk scores are 0, justified by the benign nature and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Overlooked Risks**  \n   - Given the code's purpose as a placeholder for user customization, it could potentially be misused if users insert malicious code later. However, the code as provided is safe.  \n   - No signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, or secret handling.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified in the static code)\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. They correctly identify this as a benign, boilerplate SDK template with no security issues. No adjustments are necessary based on the current static code analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a safe, standard placeholder template for SDK customization, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.",
