{
  "purpose": "A minimal SDK customization template containing licensing comments, import statements, an empty __all__ list, and a placeholder function for user modifications.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or dynamic code; static code with no data reading or writing.",
  "sinks": "None; no external outputs, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely structural code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, non-obfuscated, and benign code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, boilerplate template designed for user customization in SDK development. It contains no dynamic elements, no external data handling, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK scaffold with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent, and no modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
