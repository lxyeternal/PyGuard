  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or obfuscation:**  \n   All reports consistently identify the code as a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization, with no dynamic code, external inputs, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and static.\n\n2. **Potential vulnerabilities or security risks:**  \n   The code contains only a placeholder function (`patch_sdk`) and some import statements. It does not process untrusted data, perform I/O, or include any secrets or credentials. The reports correctly conclude that the code poses no security risk.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Analysis of the reasoning:**  \n   The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as a benign template with no malicious or security issues. The confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty.\n\n**Conclusion and Recommendations:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues are present.  \n- **Scores:** The assigned scores are reasonable and appropriate. No adjustments needed.  \n- **Risk justification:** The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are all correctly set to 0, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \nThis code is a safe, boilerplate template intended for user customization in SDK development. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports and the code's actual content.",
