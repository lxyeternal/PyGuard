{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing SDK-generated code, including a placeholder function for future modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines imports, a variable, and a function with no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or points where untrusted data could cause a leak or effect.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as there is no data input or output processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains minimal content, mainly comments, import statements, and an empty function. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward template for SDK customization. It includes no dynamic code execution, no data handling, no network activity, and no embedded secrets. Its structure is typical for a placeholder file and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template intended for customization of SDK behavior. No malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious anomalies are present.",
