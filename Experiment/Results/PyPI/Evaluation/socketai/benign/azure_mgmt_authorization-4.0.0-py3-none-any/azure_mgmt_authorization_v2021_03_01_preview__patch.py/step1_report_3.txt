{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a template or stub for customizing generated SDK code, likely for Azure SDK for Python, allowing users to add customizations to the generated SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only imports 'List' from 'typing' and defines a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and does not handle input or perform I/O.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, consisting mainly of comments, a variable declaration, and an empty function. No unusual or suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, clean template with no data processing, network activity, or execution logic. It is intended for user customization of SDK code, and contains no suspicious or malicious elements. The absence of dynamic code, external inputs, or sensitive operations indicates a very low security risk. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template for SDK customization with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides a placeholder function for user modifications and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
