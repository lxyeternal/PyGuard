  "purpose": "This code serves as boilerplate metadata, including licensing comments and a static version string assignment, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "The static assignment of VERSION and comments; no input or data reading points are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and non-executable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a static version string assignment. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with full confidence. The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign boilerplate with no security concerns or malicious intent. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified. The analysis confirms that the code poses no threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
