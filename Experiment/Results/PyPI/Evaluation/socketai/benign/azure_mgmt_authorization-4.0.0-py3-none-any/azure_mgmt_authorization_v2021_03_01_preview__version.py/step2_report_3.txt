  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely boilerplate, consisting of comments, licensing info, and a static version string assignment.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n   - Confirmed: **No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.**\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, untrusted data, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - **No errors or flaws identified in the reports.**\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.**\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, which is justified.\n   - No issues warrant a higher risk score since there's no malicious or vulnerable code.\n   - **No adjustments needed here.**\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate and correctly reflected in all reports.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on observable facts.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is conservative and accurate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThis code is standard boilerplate, metadata, and licensing comments with a static version string. It presents no security risks, malicious intent, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scoring and analysis are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
