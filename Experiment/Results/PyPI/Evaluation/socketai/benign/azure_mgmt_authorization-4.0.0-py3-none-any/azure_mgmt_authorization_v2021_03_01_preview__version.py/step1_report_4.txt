{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version identifier for a software component, likely part of a larger library or SDK.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of the string value '4.0.0' to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no data processing or output functions are included.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code merely assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The comments and licensing information are standard for open-source SDK code.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a version string assignment with licensing comments. No input, no data processing, and no potential security-sensitive operations are present. It appears to be auto-generated code, which is typical for SDKs or APIs. No malicious or suspicious elements are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define a version constant for a larger codebase. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
