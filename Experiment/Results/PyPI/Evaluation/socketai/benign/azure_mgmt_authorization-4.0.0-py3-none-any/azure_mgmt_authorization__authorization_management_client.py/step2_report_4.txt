  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an SDK client for Azure authorization management, with dynamic imports based on API version, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no signs of malware.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is auto-generated SDK boilerplate, with no signs of malicious activity. The dynamic import pattern is standard for SDKs supporting multiple API versions.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** The report assigns a low security risk (0.2) and malware score (0). This aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a generated SDK client with no malicious intent, no secrets, and standard structure.\n- **Analysis:** The assessment correctly notes that the code is for API interaction, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Security risk (0.1), malware (0). Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a client class for Azure API, with potential concern over dynamic imports if input data is untrusted.\n- **Analysis:** The key point is that the code uses dynamic import statements based on API version strings. If these version strings are controlled externally, there could be a risk of importing malicious modules. However, in typical SDK use, these strings are predefined or controlled.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Potential Concern:** If an attacker can manipulate the API version parameter, they might influence which module gets imported. But in normal SDK operation, this parameter is not externally controlled by untrusted sources.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Slightly higher security risk (0.2) due to dynamic import pattern, but no evidence of actual malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** The pattern is standard but warrants cautious handling of version inputs. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, noting the dynamic import pattern and the importance of input validation.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that if version strings are manipulated, it could lead to importing unintended modules. However, no signs of malicious code or backdoors are present.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Security risk (0.2), malware (0). Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The code is typical SDK boilerplate supporting multiple API versions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code is a structured SDK wrapper, with no malicious behavior, no backdoors, and standard design.\n- **Analysis:** The assessment aligns with the code structure—no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flow.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Security risk (0), malware (0). Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is an auto-generated SDK client with dynamic module imports based on API version, which is standard practice.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Potential concern:** The dynamic import pattern could be exploited if version strings are externally manipulated, but in typical SDK usage, this is controlled and safe.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign low malware and security risk scores, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, auto-generated SDK boilerplate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — standard pattern, with a slight caution on dynamic imports if inputs are untrusted, but generally safe in controlled environments.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK client for Azure authorization APIs supporting multiple API versions. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The dynamic import pattern is typical but should be used with input validation if version strings are externally controlled.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (depending on environment controls)  \n\nNo security threats are identified in this code.",
