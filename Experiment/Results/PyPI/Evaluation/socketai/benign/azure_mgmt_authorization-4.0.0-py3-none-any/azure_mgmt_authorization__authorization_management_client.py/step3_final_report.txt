{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated SDK client for Azure authorization management, supporting multiple API versions through dynamic module imports. It facilitates resource and policy management without containing any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as 'api_version' and 'profile' used to determine module imports and API configurations.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import statements based on 'api_version' which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted, potentially leading to importing unintended modules.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('api_version') influence the import paths and module loading, which then instantiate specific operation classes for API interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import statements based on external or configurable version strings; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, auto-generated SDK client that loads modules dynamically based on API version strings. While this pattern could pose a risk if version inputs are externally controlled, in typical SDK usage, these inputs are managed and trusted. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import pattern is standard for multi-version SDKs, and the code does not perform any suspicious actions such as network exfiltration or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK client with no malicious intent. The dynamic import pattern is common but should be used with controlled inputs to prevent potential exploitation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the dynamic import pattern, which is acceptable in a controlled SDK environment.",
