  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK client with no malicious intent. The dynamic import pattern is common but should be used with controlled inputs to prevent potential exploitation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the dynamic import pattern, which is acceptable in a controlled SDK environment."
