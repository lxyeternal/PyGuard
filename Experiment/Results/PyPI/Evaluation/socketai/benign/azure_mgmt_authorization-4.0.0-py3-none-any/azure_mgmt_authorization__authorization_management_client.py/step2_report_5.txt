  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is an auto-generated SDK client for Azure authorization, with no malicious intent, structured for resource management.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minimal, given the code's nature.  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard SDK boilerplate with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK patterns, no malicious behavior, no secret leaks, and typical dynamic module loading.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, as expected.  \n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's structure, and the low scores are justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential for untrusted data influencing module imports and API calls, raising a concern about dynamic import based on external input.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code's dynamic import pattern is typical for SDKs, and unless version strings are externally manipulated, it doesn't pose a malware risk.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — the only concern is the dynamic import pattern, which is standard but could be risky if version strings are externally controlled.  \n- **Analysis:** The report correctly notes that if version parameters are manipulated, it could lead to importing malicious modules. However, in typical SDK use, these version strings are controlled internally or by trusted configuration.  \n- **Justification for higher risk score:** Given the potential for external manipulation of version strings, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.2) is reasonable, but the malware score remains 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code execution.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the risk score is slightly elevated appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the dynamic import pattern and standard SDK structure, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — the dynamic import pattern is noted, but it's standard SDK practice.  \n- **Assessment:** The report's caution about external manipulation of version strings is valid but doesn't indicate malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a typical SDK client, with dynamic version-based imports, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no significant risk identified.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation appears justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Scores**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0; the code is an SDK client with no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear, auto-generated SDK code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** Slightly varying but generally low; considering the dynamic import pattern could be exploited if version strings are externally manipulated, a **risk score of around 0.2** is reasonable.\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and auto-generated, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.2** — due to the dynamic import pattern based on version strings, which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted. However, in typical SDK use, this is controlled.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, auto-generated SDK client for Azure authorization management, with no malicious intent. The dynamic import pattern warrants a cautious risk score but does not constitute malware. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and I concur with their conclusions.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a low-security threat profile, consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
