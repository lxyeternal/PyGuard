  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's structure, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an auto-generated SDK client for Azure authorization, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. It dynamically loads modules based on API version, which is standard SDK practice.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, structured code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — very low, considering the dynamic import pattern, but typical for SDKs.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is a standard SDK client with no malicious behavior. The dynamic import pattern, while potentially risky if input is untrusted, is common in SDKs supporting multiple API versions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is an SDK for Azure authorization APIs, with no signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — negligible, as no suspicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. The pattern of property-based access and dynamic imports is typical for SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code defining a client class for Azure Authorization APIs, with attention to data flow from parameters to API calls. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — very low, primarily due to dynamic import patterns if external input controls version strings.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that the dynamic import based on version strings could be a concern if inputs are untrusted. However, in normal SDK usage, these are controlled inputs, not user-controlled data.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, highlighting the structured, version-based dynamic import pattern, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — again, a minor concern due to dynamic import, but typical for SDKs.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a multi-version, dynamic SDK client with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no concerns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code's purpose and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is a standard auto-generated SDK client. It doesn't perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score Justification:** All assign 0, which is correct given the clear, structured code.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) due to dynamic import patterns, but this is typical in SDKs and not inherently risky unless inputs are maliciously controlled.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The dynamic import pattern based on version strings should be protected against external manipulation, but in a controlled SDK environment, this is standard.\n\n- No changes are necessary to the scores; they are reasonable and justified.\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and auto-generated.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to dynamic import pattern, but not a concern in controlled environments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, auto-generated Azure SDK client supporting multiple API versions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The current scores are appropriate.",
