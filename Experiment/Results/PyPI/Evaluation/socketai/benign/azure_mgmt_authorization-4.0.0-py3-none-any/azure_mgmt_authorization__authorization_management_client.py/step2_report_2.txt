  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the provided code and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an SDK client for Azure authorization management, with dynamic imports based on API version, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no signs of malware.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is auto-generated, structured SDK code, with no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a client SDK supporting multiple API versions, with standard class initialization and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature—auto-generated, version-dependent module imports, no secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the client class, with potential concern about untrusted data influencing module imports.\n- **Assessment:** While the code uses dynamic import statements based on API version strings, in a typical SDK context, this is standard practice. The input parameters are configuration data, not untrusted user input that could lead to code injection.\n- **Potential concern:** If the API version strings are externally controlled, theoretically, it could lead to importing unintended modules. However, in the context of SDKs, this pattern is common and controlled.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — acceptable, but note the slight caution about external control over version strings.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the pattern is standard SDK design.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the dynamic import pattern and configuration-based API calls.\n- **Assessment:** The code's dynamic import pattern is typical for multi-version SDKs. No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the structure and version-based dynamic loading, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard SDK pattern supporting multiple API versions, with no evident malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is an auto-generated SDK client, with no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Malware score justification:** All reports agree on the absence of malicious behavior. The dynamic import pattern, while potentially risky if version strings are externally manipulated, is standard for SDKs and not malicious in itself.\n- **Obfuscated score justification:** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and structured.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of dynamic import patterns but not indicating real security threats.\n\n---\n\n### My final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, auto-generated SDK.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — low, considering the dynamic import pattern but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Note:** The primary concern with dynamic imports is the potential for misuse if version strings are externally controlled. However, in a controlled SDK environment, this pattern is standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable.
