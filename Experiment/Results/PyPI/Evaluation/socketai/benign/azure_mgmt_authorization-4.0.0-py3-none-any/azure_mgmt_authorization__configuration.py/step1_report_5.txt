  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for Azure Authorization Management Client, setting up policies and credentials for Azure SDK communication.",
  "sources": "Credential parameter input, environment variables indirectly (if used for credentials), imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of credential input for authentication, configuration parameters for HTTP policies.",
  "flows": "Credential input -> stored in class attribute -> used in authentication policy setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual logic or backdoors. The code appears standard for SDK configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a configuration class for Azure SDK management client, setting various policies and handling credentials securely. It verifies that credentials and subscription IDs are provided and configures policies accordingly. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected; the code follows standard SDK practices. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. All data flows are from input parameters to SDK configurations, with no external data exfiltration or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It properly manages credentials and policies without exposing sensitive information or performing harmful actions.",
