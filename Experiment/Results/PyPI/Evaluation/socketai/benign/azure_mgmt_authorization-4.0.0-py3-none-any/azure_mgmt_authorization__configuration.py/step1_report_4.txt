  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for the Azure Authorization Management client, setting up policies and authentication details.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'credential' and 'subscription_id'; optional 'kwargs' for configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored as attributes; policies are configured based on input or defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. No use of obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration class for an Azure SDK client. It properly validates required parameters ('credential' and 'subscription_id'), assigns them to instance attributes, and sets default policies. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code follows typical SDK configuration patterns with no signs of hidden or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for configuring Azure SDK client behavior. No malware, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
