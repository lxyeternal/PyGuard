  "purpose": "Define configuration class for Azure Authorization Management client, managing credentials and policies.",
  "sources": "Credential input parameter, optional kwargs for policies, VERSION import.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Credential provided during instantiation is used for authentication policy setup; policies configured internally based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class for an Azure management client, initializing with credentials and subscription ID. It validates inputs, sets default policies, and configures an authentication policy based on provided credentials. All parameters are used for configuration only, with no evident data leaks, external calls, or malicious logic. The code is standard and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a normal, well-structured configuration class for Azure SDK client setup. There are no signs of malware, suspicious external communication, or malicious intent.",
