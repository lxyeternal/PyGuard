  "purpose": "Configuration class for Azure Authorization Management client, managing credentials, subscription ID, and policies.",
  "sources": "Credential parameter, subscription_id parameter, policy instantiations, optional kwargs for policies",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks; no external communication or data exfiltration present",
  "flows": "Credential and subscription_id are validated and assigned; policies are instantiated from SDK components; no external data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard SDK patterns, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK configuration class validating inputs, setting default policies, and conditionally creating an authentication policy. It uses standard Azure SDK components without any obfuscated or malicious code. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is well-structured, with proper validation and default settings, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK configuration class with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. All signals point to a safe, well-structured implementation.",
