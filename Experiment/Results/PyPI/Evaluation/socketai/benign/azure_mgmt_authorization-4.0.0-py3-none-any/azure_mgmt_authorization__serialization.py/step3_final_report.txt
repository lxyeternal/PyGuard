  "purpose": "Provides serialization and deserialization utilities for JSON, XML, datetime, enums, and data streams, primarily used within SDKs for data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data streams, headers, bytes, and internal attributes during serialization/deserialization processes.",
  "sinks": "Processes data for output, including JSON/XML parsing, encoding, and model instantiation; no external network or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through parsing functions, type conversions (notably eval), and into model objects or output formats.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() in serialize_basic() and deserialize_basic() for dynamic type conversion; standard pattern but potential security concern if data_type is externally influenced.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive utility for data serialization/deserialization, handling JSON, XML, date/time, enums, and models. Eval() is used for converting string type names to actual types, which is common in such libraries. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The pattern is typical for SDK internal utilities, with minimal security risk if inputs are controlled. No network activity or sabotage mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured serialization/deserialization utility with no malicious intent. Eval() usage, while a potential security concern, is acceptable in this controlled context. No evidence of sabotage, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. Overall security risk is very low.",
