  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports internal modules (_authorization_management_client, _patch, _version).\n- It defines `__all__` and `__version__`.\n- It attempts to import and execute `patch_sdk()` within a try-except block, ignoring ImportError.\n- It contains licensing and code generation comments.\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted data is present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Generated SDK module for authorization management.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted sinks, no data flow, no anomalies, benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, boilerplate code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is boilerplate SDK setup with no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Initializes and configures AuthorizationManagementClient, sets version info.\n- **Findings:** No evident sinks, benign try-except for patch_sdk, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Straightforward SDK setup, no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero, but justifiable as minimal risk)\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard SDK initialization with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** SDK initialization, version setup, optional patch.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data sinks, benign try-except, no secrets or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical SDK setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** SDK setup, versioning, optional patch.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious side effects, benign try-except, typical generated code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, safe.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** SDK module for authorization management.\n- **Findings:** No external effects, no malicious signs, standard structure.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no risks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is boilerplate SDK initialization code.\n- No untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n- The use of try-except around `patch_sdk()` is standard practice for optional patches.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final scoring:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward and generated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, mainly due to the try-except pattern which could be slightly suspicious if misused, but in this context is normal.\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard SDK boilerplate)\n\nThis code is a standard, generated SDK module with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.",
