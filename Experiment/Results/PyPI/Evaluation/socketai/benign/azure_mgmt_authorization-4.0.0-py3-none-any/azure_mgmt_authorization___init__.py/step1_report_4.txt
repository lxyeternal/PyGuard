{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures an SDK client for authorization management, setting up module imports and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Import statements: '_authorization_management_client', '_patch', and '_version' modules; use of 'patch_sdk' function.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and version assignment flow, with optional execution of 'patch_sdk' during import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block to conditionally execute 'patch_sdk' without logging or handling failures could be suspicious if misused, but in this context appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, sets the __all__ and __version__, and attempts to patch the SDK via 'patch_sdk'. The try-except block is designed to handle missing '_patch' gracefully, with no suspicious side effects. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual dynamic behaviors. The code appears to be a typical SDK initialization script generated by a code generator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to prepare the SDK environment and manage versioning. The try-except for 'patch_sdk' is benign and does not indicate malicious intent.",
