{
  "purpose": "The code is a generated SDK module for Microsoft Azure authorization management, primarily for initializing and exposing client classes and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_authorization_management_client, _patch, _version) and a try-except block attempting to import and execute patch_sdk.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external effects are present. The code does not process user input or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward. The try block may execute patch_sdk, which is a function imported from a local module, with fallback to no operation if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The try-except block is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Python package module with imports, version setting, and a conditional call to a local patch function. It does not process external inputs, handle sensitive data, or perform network operations. Its structure is typical for generated SDK code, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK module for Azure authorization management, with no indications of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
