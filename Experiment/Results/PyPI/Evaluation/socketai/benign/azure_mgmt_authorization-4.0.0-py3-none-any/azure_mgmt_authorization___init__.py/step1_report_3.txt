{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a client library for authorization management, sets version information, and applies optional patches for SDK modifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_authorization_management_client, _patch, _version). The only dynamic behavior is the conditional import and execution of patch_sdk().",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, executing patch_sdk() if available, and setting version variables. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a try-except block around the patch_sdk() import is standard. No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be boilerplate for a Python SDK, with license comments, imports, and optional patch application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The patch_sdk() function call is wrapped in a try-except to prevent errors if the module is missing, which is typical for optional patches.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard SDK initialization script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
