  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the findings with the code and assessing the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a boilerplate SDK module, generated by Microsoft, importing internal modules, setting version info, and conditionally applying a patch via `patch_sdk()`.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, untrusted data handling, network activity, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The use of try-except around `patch_sdk()` is standard for optional patches.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the code as generated SDK boilerplate with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) might be justified due to the try-except block, but it's standard and benign. The malware score remains 0.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with the benign nature; emphasizes that `patch_sdk()` is optional and wrapped in try-except.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** No issues; the minimal risk score is appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings; notes benign SDK initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard SDK setup with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — code is straightforward, generated boilerplate.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is acceptable given the try-except pattern, but still minimal.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is standard SDK initialization code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No changes are necessary to the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the try-except pattern, but still very low)\n\nThis code is benign, with no security concerns.",
