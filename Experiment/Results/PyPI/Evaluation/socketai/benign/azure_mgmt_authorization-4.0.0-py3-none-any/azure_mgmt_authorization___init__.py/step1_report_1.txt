{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a generated SDK module for managing authorization, likely used for interacting with Microsoft Azure's authorization services.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules (_authorization_management_client, _patch, _version), and the assignment of __all__ and __version__ variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly imports modules and executes a patch function if available.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a try-except block for optional patching, which is standard. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is boilerplate for a generated SDK.",
  "analysis": "The script imports internal client classes and applies a patch if available. It includes licensing and code generation comments, with no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns. The presence of a try-except for optional patching is normal for SDKs. No malicious behavior or anomalous activity is evident. The code's structure indicates it's a boilerplate SDK setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK module for authorization management with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as part of a larger SDK framework and does not perform any harmful operations.",
