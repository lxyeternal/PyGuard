  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content with the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a generated SDK module for Azure authorization management.\n- It contains only import statements, version setup, and an optional patch application.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- The try-except block around `patch_sdk()` is standard for optional patches.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a generated SDK module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks or data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard use of try-except.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, benign boilerplate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **securityRisk:** 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the purpose as initializing SDK components.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of try-except is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly high, but considering the code's benign nature, a very low risk is acceptable.\n\n**Suggestion:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is marginally above zero but still very low. It might be more accurate to set it to 0, given the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, with consistent observations.\n- The only potential concern is the try-except around `patch_sdk()`.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0 — more appropriate than 0.1, as no actual risk is identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score should be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Same as above; standard SDK setup.\n- The try-except is benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Similar analysis; no malicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but still high.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0 — more accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, except for report 2 which has 0.1. Given the benign nature, it should be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, generated boilerplate.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk identified; the try-except is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor risk score in report 2 should be adjusted to 0 for consistency.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Set all risk scores to 0.  \n- Confirm that no hidden dynamic behaviors or obfuscation are present (none detected).  \n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and typical for SDK initialization. The scores should reflect this with zero risk and malware scores.",
