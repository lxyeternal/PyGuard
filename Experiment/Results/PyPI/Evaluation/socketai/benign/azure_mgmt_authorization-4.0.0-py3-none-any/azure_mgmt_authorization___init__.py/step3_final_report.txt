  "purpose": "Generated SDK module for authorization management, involving imports, version setup, and optional patch application.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_authorization_management_client, _patch, _version), execution of patch_sdk() within try-except.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and optional execution of patch_sdk() without data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except around patch_sdk() is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, generated SDK module with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The try-except block for patch_sdk() is a common pattern for optional patches and does not introduce security issues. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All signals indicate benign, boilerplate SDK setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK initialization code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and appropriate.",
