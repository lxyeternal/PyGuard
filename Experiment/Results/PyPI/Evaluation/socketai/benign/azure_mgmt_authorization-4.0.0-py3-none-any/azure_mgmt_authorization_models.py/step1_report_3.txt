{
  "purpose": "The code imports models from various versions of a package, likely for use in a larger application that interacts with different API versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.v2015_07_01.models, .v2019_08_01_preview.models, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple versioned imports might be unnecessary or risky if versions are not properly managed, but it is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from versioned model modules, which is common in SDKs or API client libraries to support multiple API versions. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious behaviors. No signs of obfuscation or malware. The structure is straightforward and typical for such use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of import statements for versioned models within a software package. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
