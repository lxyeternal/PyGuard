  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code only performs import statements from versioned modules. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low), confidence=0.9.  \n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward import statements. No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** The zero malware score is justified; the code appears purely structural.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—importing multiple versioned modules, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, only import statements, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, benign import statements for multiple versions.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports confirm that the code is just import statements from versioned modules, with no execution, network activity, or data handling.  \n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.  \n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal risk associated with static import statements.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- The code is a standard pattern for managing multiple API or SDK versions.  \n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.  \n- The scores assigned are reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate (after critical review):\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal, structural nature of the code, but no actual security concern)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports and the logical analysis of the code snippet.\n\n**Final note:** The code is benign, and no changes to the scores are necessary.",
