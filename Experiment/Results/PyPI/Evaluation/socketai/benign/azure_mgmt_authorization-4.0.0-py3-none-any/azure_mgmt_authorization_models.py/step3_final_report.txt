  "purpose": "Import statements for multiple versioned modules within an SDK or client library to support various API versions.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local versioned modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; only static imports.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static import of models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from versioned modules, typical for SDKs managing multiple API versions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk score is minimal, reflecting the benign and structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard pattern for managing multiple API or SDK versions. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
