  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements from versioned modules within a package.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, network operations, data processing, or code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose appears to be supporting multiple API versions within an SDK or client library.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; straightforward import statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard for version management, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low), confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score is reasonable; no malware risk. The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is only for importing modules, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The scores align well with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, just versioned imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no malicious risk.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns; standard import statements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; typical multi-version SDK pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code content.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. The first report's 0.1 is slightly higher but still very low.\n\n**Considering the entire set, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0, since the code is purely structural and does not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent with the code content. The scores are reasonable, with no need for adjustments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks evident.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, harmless set of import statements within an SDK or client library.",
