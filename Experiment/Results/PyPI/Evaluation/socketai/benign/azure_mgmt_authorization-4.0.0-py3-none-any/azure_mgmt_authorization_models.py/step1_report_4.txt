{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple model modules from different versions of a library, likely for use in a larger project related to Microsoft services.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from local package paths (.v2015_07_01.models, .v2019_08_01_preview.models, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple versioned modules suggests maintenance or compatibility management, but no suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for different versions of model modules from a local package structure. It appears to facilitate version management or compatibility across multiple API versions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as dynamic code execution, network access, or data leaks. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to import various model definitions for use in a larger application. It does not contain malware or security risks based on its content.",
