{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple models from different versions of a package or SDK, likely for use in a larger application that interacts with various versions of an API or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules from local package subdirectories (e.g., .v2015_07_01.models).",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing are present; no external data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports without executing any further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The import statements are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from various versioned model modules within a package. There is no execution, data handling, or potentially malicious behavior. The structure suggests modular design for interacting with different API versions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are detected. The code appears to be purely structural, facilitating access to different model versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import setup for multiple API model versions. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It is likely part of a larger SDK or client library setup.",
