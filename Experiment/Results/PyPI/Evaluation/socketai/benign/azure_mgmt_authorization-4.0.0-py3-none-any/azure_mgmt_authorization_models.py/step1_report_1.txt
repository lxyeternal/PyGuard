{
  "purpose": "This code imports models from various versioned modules within a package, likely related to an SDK or API client library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module files and imports specific components from these modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to potentially utilizing these models elsewhere; no direct flow to untrusted sources is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The import statements are straightforward and versioned.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely composed of import statements from multiple versioned modules, suggesting it is part of a larger SDK or client library. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, code execution, or data exfiltration. The code appears standard for version management of API models. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation detected. The structure indicates a typical import pattern for modular code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements for different API model versions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior observed. It appears to be a legitimate part of a software development kit or client library without any security concerns.",
