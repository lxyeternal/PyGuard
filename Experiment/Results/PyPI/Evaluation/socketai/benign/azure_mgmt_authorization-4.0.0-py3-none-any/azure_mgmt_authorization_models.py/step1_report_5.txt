{
  "purpose": "The code imports multiple model modules from different versions of a library, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No direct data input; imports from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code that executes or processes external input or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Import statements are straightforward and versioned.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple versioned modules from relative paths, indicating an effort to support multiple API versions. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or network activity are present. The structure appears to be part of a SDK or client library setup, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import pattern for a multi-version SDK. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and typical for library version management.",
