  "purpose": "Define a version string for a software package or module.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not output or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; presence of license and copyright comments, but no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and a single variable assignment setting VERSION to '4.0.0'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no output sinks, and no executable logic. This is typical of a version declaration snippet in a larger project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
