  "purpose": "This code serves as a simple version identifier for the software, containing only a string assignment and licensing comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code assigns a constant string to a variable without any data movement or processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, minimal declaration of a version string with licensing comments. It contains no input sources, data flows, or sinks. The code is syntactically correct, standard for open-source versioning, and shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier with no security implications. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
