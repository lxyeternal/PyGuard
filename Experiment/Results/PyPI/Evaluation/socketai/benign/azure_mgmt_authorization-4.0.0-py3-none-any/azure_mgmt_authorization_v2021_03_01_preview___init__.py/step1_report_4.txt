{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a generated SDK module for Microsoft Azure's Authorization Management, meant to import necessary classes, set version info, and apply patches.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_authorization_management_client, _version, _patch) and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code mainly performs static imports and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard import (*) within a try-except block could potentially lead to namespace pollution, but it is a common pattern in generated SDKs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary components for a SDK, sets version info, and applies patches dynamically. The try-except block ensures fallback if certain modules are unavailable. No user input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing is evident. The pattern is consistent with SDK initialization scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical generated SDK initialization module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly handles imports and patching procedures with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
