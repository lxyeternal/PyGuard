{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures a Python client SDK for authorization management, including versioning and patching mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_authorization_management_client, _version, _patch) and dynamic import of patch functions.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no handling of untrusted input or data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and calling _patch_sdk() without data flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of try-except for optional imports is standard. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles module imports, version assignment, and applying patches. It follows typical SDK setup patterns, with safe exception handling and module extension. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious actions, or malicious code logic. It appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for a client SDK, with no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK initialization code with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or perform any network or system modifications. Overall, it appears safe.",
