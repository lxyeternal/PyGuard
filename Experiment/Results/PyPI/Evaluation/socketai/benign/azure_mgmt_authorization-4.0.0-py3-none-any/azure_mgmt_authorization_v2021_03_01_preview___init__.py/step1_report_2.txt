{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization script for a Microsoft authorization management SDK, setting up imports, versioning, and patching mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_authorization_management_client, _version, _patch).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted input or external data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and patch functions are invoked during module load, establishing SDK components but without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward SDK setup code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, handles optional patch imports with try-except, manages version info, and extends the __all__ list for exports. It calls a patch function at the end. No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be auto-generated SDK boilerplate meant for internal use and does not contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK initialization boilerplate without malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages imports and patching procedures for an SDK module, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
