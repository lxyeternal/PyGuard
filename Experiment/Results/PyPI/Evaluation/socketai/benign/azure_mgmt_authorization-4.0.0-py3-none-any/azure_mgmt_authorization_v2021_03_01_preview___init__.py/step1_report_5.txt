{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated SDK component for managing authorization, likely part of a larger Azure or Microsoft service SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, specifically _authorization_management_client, _version, and _patch.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "The code imports internal modules, sets version info, conditionally imports patch functions, and applies a patch via _patch_sdk(). No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. Usage of wildcard imports with comments to disable pylint warnings is standard in generated SDK code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes module versioning, imports core SDK components, and applies optional patches. It uses standard Python practices for optional imports and module exports. The conditional import of _patch and the invocation of _patch_sdk() are typical for SDK setup routines. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code is clean, well-structured, and consistent with auto-generated SDK modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK module initialization script with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It performs setup tasks typical for SDK components without any suspicious activities.",
