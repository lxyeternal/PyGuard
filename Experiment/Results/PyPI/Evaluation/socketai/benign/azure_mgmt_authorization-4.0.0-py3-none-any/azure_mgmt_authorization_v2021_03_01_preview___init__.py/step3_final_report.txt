{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Microsoft Azure authorization management SDK module, importing core components, setting version info, handling optional patches, and applying patches.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules, version assignment, optional patch import with try-except, and the call to _patch_sdk().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file operations; internal module calls only.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version setting lead to optional patch import, then extending __all__, and finally calling _patch_sdk().",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import within try-except, which is common in generated SDKs but can cause namespace pollution; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated SDK setup script with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads. It handles optional imports gracefully, sets up module exports, and applies internal patches. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of wildcard import is typical in such contexts and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's benign nature is consistent with the assigned scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and typical SDK boilerplate. No malicious or security issues are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
