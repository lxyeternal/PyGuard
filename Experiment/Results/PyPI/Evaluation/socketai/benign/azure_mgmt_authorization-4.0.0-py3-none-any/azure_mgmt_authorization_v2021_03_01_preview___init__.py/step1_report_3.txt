{
  "purpose": "This code is for importing and initializing modules related to authorization management, versioning, and patches, likely as part of a larger SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules such as ._authorization_management_client, ._version, and conditional import of ._patch",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or environment variable handling present",
  "flows": "Initialization flows involve importing modules and setting up the __all__ list, and calling _patch_sdk() at the end",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as obfuscated code, hidden network connections, or hardcoded secrets. Use of try-except for optional import is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary components for an SDK, manages module exports, and applies patches. It includes a conditional import with exception handling to ensure optional components are loaded if available. The call to _patch_sdk() suggests applying runtime modifications or patches, but there's no indication of malicious behavior. All operations are standard for a Python SDK setup and do not involve any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard SDK initialization script, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It manages module imports, versioning, and patching in a typical manner without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
