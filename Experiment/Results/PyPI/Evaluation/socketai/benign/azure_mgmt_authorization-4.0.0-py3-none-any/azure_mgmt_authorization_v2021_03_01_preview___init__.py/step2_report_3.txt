  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports internal modules related to authorization management, versioning, and patching.\n- It assigns a version number.\n- It attempts to import optional patch functions, handling ImportError gracefully.\n- It extends the `__all__` list with exported symbols.\n- It calls `_patch_sdk()` at the end.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - No evidence of obfuscated code, hidden network connections, or malicious payloads.\n   - The use of try-except for optional imports is standard.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or data leaks are present.\n   - The code performs typical SDK setup routines.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - The use of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) within a try-except block is common in generated SDKs, though it can sometimes lead to namespace pollution. However, given the context, it appears intentional and controlled.\n   - No logical errors or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0, consistent across reports and justified.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Risk score:** 0, as the code is standard initialization with no security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data directly.\n   - The patching mechanism is internal and standard for SDKs.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are cautious and based on observable code behavior.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated code, and a risk score of 0, which aligns with the code analysis.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical auto-generated SDK initialization module with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It performs standard import and patching routines safely.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is safe and does not pose security risks.\n- No changes needed in scoring or conclusions.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed review of any specific aspect or further analysis.",
