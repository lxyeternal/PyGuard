{
  "purpose": "The code provides test resource management and testing utilities, with no external input or data reading.",
  "sources": "Internal method calls, resource state counters, and mock resource classes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; internal resource management only.",
  "flows": "Resource creation, usage, dirtied, finishedWith, and reset methods within the test infrastructure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing utility suite with mock resources, resource lifecycle management, and test case helpers. It contains no external data input, network activity, or system commands. The logic is straightforward, with counters and resource management methods that are typical for testing frameworks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a testing infrastructure for resource management. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security risks. The low risk scores are justified given its testing purpose and internal nature.",
