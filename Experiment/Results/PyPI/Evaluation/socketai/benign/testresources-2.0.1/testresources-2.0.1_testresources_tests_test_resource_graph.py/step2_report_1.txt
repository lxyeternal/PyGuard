  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** All describe the code as a standard, benign test suite for the 'testresources' package, focusing on graph algorithms, resource management, and related unit tests. They consistently note:\n  - No external data sources or untrusted inputs.\n  - No network or file system operations.\n  - No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.\n  - No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n  - High confidence (mostly 0.9-1.0).\n\n**Confirming the code's safety:**\n\n- The code is purely test code, performing in-memory assertions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or external dependencies that could be exploited.\n- The functions tested are standard algorithms (graph conversion, MST, resource overlaps).\n- No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no network activity.\n\n**Logical flaws or mistakes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is straightforward, with no hidden behaviors or suspicious constructs.\n- The scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, the overall security risk should be very low, close to 0.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n\n- The last report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, which seems slightly high for such benign code. It might be a conservative default or a minor misclassification.\n- Since all other indicators are zero, I would suggest the overall risk score should be **0** or very close to it.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code is a typical test suite with no signs of supply chain compromise.\n- The consistent evaluations across reports reinforce the benign nature.\n- No need to adjust scores upward; the conservative approach is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, benign test suite for graph algorithms and resource management within the 'testresources' package. The scores should reflect this low risk.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0**",
