{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'testresources' package, focusing on graph algorithms and resource management functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from in-memory data structures such as frozensets, dictionaries, and class instances; no external or untrusted data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code only performs assertions on internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal test inputs through algorithm functions (_resource_graph, _digraph_to_graph, _kruskals_graph_MST) and into assertions, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite that verifies graph transformations and resource overlaps using standard Python testing frameworks. It involves no external data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All tests are in-memory and use well-known algorithms. No malicious patterns or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign test suite for graph algorithms and resource management within the 'testresources' package. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
