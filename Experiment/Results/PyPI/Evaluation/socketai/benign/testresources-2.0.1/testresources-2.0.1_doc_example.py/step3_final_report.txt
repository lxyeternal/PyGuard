{
  "purpose": "The code defines test resource management classes extending TestResourceManager for use in unit testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and method implementations within the code, no external data inputs or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data that could lead to leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists of static class definitions with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward class structures with placeholder methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, static class definitions for resource management in testing, with no network activity, external data handling, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. The code serves as scaffolding for tests and does not perform any harmful actions or contain vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
