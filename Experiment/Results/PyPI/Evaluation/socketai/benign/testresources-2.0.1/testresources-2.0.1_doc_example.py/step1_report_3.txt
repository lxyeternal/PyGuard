  "purpose": "Define sample resource management classes for unit testing, demonstrating resource setup and dependency handling.",
  "sources": "Import of TestResourceManager from testresources; class attributes and method definitions within SampleTestResource and SampleWithDependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output; no network, file, or system command interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No external input flows; resource creation flows within make methods, which currently return static or placeholder data.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be example or test scaffolding with placeholder implementations. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines resource management classes intended for testing purposes, extending a known testing utility. It uses standard class attributes and methods with no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or system interactions. No malicious or suspicious logic is present, and the code appears benign, primarily serving as illustrative or scaffolding code for unit tests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of resource management classes for testing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
