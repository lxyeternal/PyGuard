{
  "purpose": "The code defines test resource management classes for use with Python's unittest framework, allowing declarative resource setup and dependency management in tests.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; static code with class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily class and method definitions without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears standard for test resource management, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing resource management library, defines resource classes, and sets up resource dependencies. There are no indications of malicious code such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate testing utility classes. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be legitimate, standard test resource management code with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
