{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a test suite using testtools and testresources, loading tests from the current module and verifying the type of the test suite.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) for test discovery and imports standard testing libraries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or external data processing are present.",
  "flows": "Test loader loads tests from __name__, and the test case verifies the suite type; no external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard test setup script utilizing well-known testing libraries. It performs test suite loading and verification without external data, network activity, or malicious code. The code's simplicity and adherence to common patterns indicate benign intent. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all justified as zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless test setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
