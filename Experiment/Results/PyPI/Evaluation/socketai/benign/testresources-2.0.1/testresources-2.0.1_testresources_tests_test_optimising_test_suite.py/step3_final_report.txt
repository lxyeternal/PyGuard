{
  "purpose": "The code extends Python's unittest framework to manage resources and optimize test suite execution order, focusing on resource counting, test sorting, and suite management.",
  "sources": "Reads input from test case instances, resource managers, and test suite structures within the testing framework.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal resource management and test execution flow are contained within the testing environment.",
  "flows": "Test cases and resource objects are used as sources; resource acquisition and test execution are the main flows, with no external data flow or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code manages test resources, sorts tests based on resource costs, and handles test suite composition. It does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution. No external data leaks or malicious patterns are present. The resource management is internal and controlled, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, well-structured testing utility aimed at resource management and test execution optimization. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.05-0.1), justified by its internal, controlled nature.",
