  "purpose": "A utility class extending io.FileIO to read specific chunks of a file based on offset and size, enforcing read-only mode for safe partial file access.",
  "sources": "File path provided to the constructor; os.stat to determine file size when bytes is None.",
  "sinks": "seek(), tell(), read(), readall(), readinto() methods managing file position and data reading within the chunk boundaries.",
  "flows": "Initialization reads file size if needed; seek() adjusts position within chunk; read() and readinto() retrieve data constrained by chunk limits.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive call in seek() method for SEEK_CUR case (self.seek(self.tell() + offset)) could cause infinite recursion; should call super().seek() instead.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a safe, read-only file chunk reader with proper bounds checking and mode validation. It uses standard library functions and does not perform network operations or obfuscation. The only technical flaw is the recursive seek call, which may cause runtime errors but not security issues. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe utility for reading file chunks, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is a minor bug in seek() that should be corrected to prevent recursion errors. Overall, it poses minimal security risk and is suitable for use in secure environments.",
