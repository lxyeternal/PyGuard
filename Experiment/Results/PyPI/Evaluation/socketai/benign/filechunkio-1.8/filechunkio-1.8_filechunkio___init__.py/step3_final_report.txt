  "purpose": "Set package version information and import a local file handling class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__, local module import, assignment of __version__ and VERSION variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; straightforward assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'VERSION' is assigned after being used in the same line, which is valid in Python but may cause confusion; no malicious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing future features, importing a local class, and setting version variables. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code. The only minor point is that 'VERSION' is assigned after being used in the same line, which is syntactically valid but could be clearer if separated. The 'VERSION' variable is assigned here, so it is defined within this context, and no runtime error will occur. No data flows from untrusted sources, and no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, typical for package initialization, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor concern is the variable assignment style, which does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and well within normal expectations.",
