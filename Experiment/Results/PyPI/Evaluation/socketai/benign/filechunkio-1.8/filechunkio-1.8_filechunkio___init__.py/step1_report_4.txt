{
  "purpose": "Importing a future feature for absolute imports and importing a class named FileChunkIO from a relative module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .filechunkio import FileChunkIO",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows; only import statements and version assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and version assignment, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature to ensure consistent import behavior and imports a class from a local module, which is common practice in Python packages. The __version__ is set to 1.8, indicating package versioning. There are no suspicious operations, no user input handling, and no external network activity or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is straightforward module initialization code with no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks identified. The code appears benign and typical of Python package setup.",
