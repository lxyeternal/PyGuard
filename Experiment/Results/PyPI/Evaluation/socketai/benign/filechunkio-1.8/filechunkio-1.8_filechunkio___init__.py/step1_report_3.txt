  "purpose": "This code appears to set up import statements and define a version identifier, likely as part of a larger package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for FileChunkIO from a local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ import for compatibility; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; version assigned as a static number",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature to ensure compatibility across Python versions, then imports a class or function from a local module 'filechunkio'. It also defines a version number. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data handling, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module initialization code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
