  "purpose": "Unit tests for the FileChunkIO class, verifying file reading, seeking, and chunk handling behaviors.",
  "sources": "Temporary file creation and reading operations within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; interactions limited to local file I/O.",
  "flows": "File content is read and seeked within test cases; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a file chunk I/O class, involving local temporary files and standard file operations. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication is present. The tests verify expected behaviors without any signs of sabotage or security risks. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
