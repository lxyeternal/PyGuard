  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'filechunkio' Python module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, distutils.core, and __version__ from filechunkio.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules, defining a version variable, and calling setup() with package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The use of __version__ from the package is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard packaging practices to define package metadata, including the version, author info, and classifiers. It defines a Python 2 and 3 compatible setup. No input data is processed dynamically; no external data flows are present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
