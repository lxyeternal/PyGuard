{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'filechunkio' Python package, including metadata and package info.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`sys`, `distutils.core`, `filechunkio.__version__`), environment info (`sys.version_info`).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external outputs are directly influenced by external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file, importing necessary modules, defining package metadata, and configuring packaging options. It reads the version from the package's __version__ attribute, adapts to Python 2 and 3 environments, and does not perform any runtime actions beyond package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides package metadata and configuration.",
