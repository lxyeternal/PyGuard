  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'filechunkio' Python module.",
  "sources": "Imports '__version__' from 'filechunkio' and system info via 'sys.version_info'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or malicious output.",
  "flows": "Version information flows from '__version__' into setup() as a string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports version info and system details, then calls setup() with package metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing. The reliance on '__version__' is standard; unless '__version__' is maliciously altered, this is safe. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to common packaging practices indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
