{
  "purpose": "Build configuration and setup script for the 'tesserocr' Python package, involving environment detection, dependency checks, and extension compilation setup.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from files and subprocess outputs; accesses environment variables ('LIBPATH', 'INCLUDE'); calls external tools ('pkg-config', 'tesseract -v').",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to system tools; environment variables that influence build parameters.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs influence build configuration; subprocess calls depend on external system tools.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads detected; code is straightforward and standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build setup script for a Python extension wrapping Tesseract OCR, utilizing subprocess calls and environment variables for configuration. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The subprocess calls are controlled and standard, and the code handles errors appropriately. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. The slight risk score reflects potential manipulation of environment variables, which is common in build environments but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured build configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score appropriately accounts for environment reliance without indicating actual threat.",
