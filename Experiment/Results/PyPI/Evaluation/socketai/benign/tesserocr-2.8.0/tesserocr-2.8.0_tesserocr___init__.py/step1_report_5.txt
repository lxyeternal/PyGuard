{
  "purpose": "The code imports the version information and all components from the 'tesserocr' module, likely to facilitate OCR functionalities.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ and all symbols from the tesserocr package",
  "sinks": "Potential misuse of imported functions or data if the package is malicious, but no specific sink is evident in the code snippet",
  "flows": "N/A - The code simply performs imports without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered suspicious as it obscures what is imported and may hide malicious functions; no explicit malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute to possibly check the package version. The 'import *' imports all symbols from the 'tesserocr' package, which can be a security concern if the package contains malicious functions. However, on its own, this pattern is common and not necessarily malicious. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code operations in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements for a package likely related to OCR. The use of 'import *' is potentially unsafe or suspicious but not inherently malicious in this context. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
