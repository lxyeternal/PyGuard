{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and all components from the tesserocr module, likely for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .tesserocr, which may access module attributes or data.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only module imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __version__ attribute and all other members from the tesserocr module. This is typical for a module setup or initialization, with no evidence of malicious intent. The simplicity and clarity of the code reduce suspicion. No external inputs, network calls, or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, performing standard module imports without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger package that relies on tesserocr.",
