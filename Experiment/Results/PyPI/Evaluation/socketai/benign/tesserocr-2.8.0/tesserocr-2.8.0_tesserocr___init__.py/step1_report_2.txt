{
  "purpose": "This code imports version information and all symbols from the tesserocr module, likely for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local tesserocr module (__version__ and *), which read the module's version info and all its public components.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input sources or data sinks are explicitly present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly visible; the code only performs imports, which do not involve data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can lead to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward import operations from a local module, retrieving version info and importing all symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and standard for module setup. Since it only imports, there are no apparent security risks or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a typical module import pattern with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply loads necessary components from the tesserocr package.",
