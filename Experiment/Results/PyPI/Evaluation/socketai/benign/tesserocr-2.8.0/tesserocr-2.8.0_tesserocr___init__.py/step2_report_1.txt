  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n### General observations across all reports:\n- The code snippet is straightforward: importing `__version__` and all symbols from `.tesserocr`.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is common in package internal code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior; use of wildcard import is a concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The low security risk score reflects the minimal concern. The malware score is correctly zero.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Standard import pattern; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The minimal risk score is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Benign, standard imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; no malicious behavior, standard imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Use of `import *` can be suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score is reasonable due to the potential for namespace pollution, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the use of `import *`, which can be considered a minor risk but not a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher (around 0.1–0.2) is justified due to `import *`. No need to increase further.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the use of `import *`, but not a significant threat)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriately low, with the minor concern about namespace pollution acknowledged.\n\n**No changes necessary.**",
