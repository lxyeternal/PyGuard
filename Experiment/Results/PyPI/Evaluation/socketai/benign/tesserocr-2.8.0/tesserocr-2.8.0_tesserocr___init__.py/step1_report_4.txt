{
  "purpose": "The code is importing version information and all contents from the tesserocr package, likely to facilitate usage of OCR functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the package: 'from .tesserocr import __version__' and 'from .tesserocr import *'.",
  "sinks": "No specific sinks or data outputs are evident in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling present; only static imports are used.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can hide imported identifiers, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from the local tesserocr package. It imports a version identifier and then all symbols from the same package. There are no external inputs, data processing, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be standard for setting up a module or script that depends on tesserocr functionalities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation, and no external communication or system modification actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement for a Python package, with no indication of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It is standard and does not pose a security risk.",
