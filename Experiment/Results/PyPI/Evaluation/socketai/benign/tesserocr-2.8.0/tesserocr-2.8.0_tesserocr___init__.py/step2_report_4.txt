  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from a local package `.tesserocr`.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or data processing are involved.\n- The use of `from .tesserocr import *` (wildcard import) is noted as potentially risky for namespace pollution but is common in internal package code.\n- No signs of malicious behavior such as code obfuscation, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.\n- The confidence scores are high (0.8–0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only performs straightforward imports. There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Any errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  The reports are accurate in their assessment. They correctly note that the wildcard import is a potential namespace pollution concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The scores for malware (0) are appropriate.  \n  The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal risk.  \n  The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:** All zero, justified, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), indicating minimal concern, mainly about namespace pollution, which is acceptable in internal code but worth noting.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The use of `from .tesserocr import *` is generally discouraged outside internal modules because it can lead to namespace pollution. While not malicious, it could be flagged for best practices.\n- The scores should remain as is, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent or activity. The minor concern is the wildcard import, which is a common but discouraged practice, but it does not elevate the security risk significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code poses no security threat based on the provided snippet.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
