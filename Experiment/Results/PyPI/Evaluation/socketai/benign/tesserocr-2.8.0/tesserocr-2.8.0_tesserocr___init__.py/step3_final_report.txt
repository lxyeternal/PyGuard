{
  "purpose": "The code performs relative imports from the local package '.tesserocr', importing a version string and all symbols. It is likely part of package initialization or internal module setup.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ attribute and all other symbols from the '.tesserocr' module via relative import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The code imports data from the '.tesserocr' module into the current namespace; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can cause namespace pollution; no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward relative import statements, importing a version string and all symbols from a local module. No external inputs, network activity, or data processing occurs. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but common in package internal code; it does not imply malicious intent. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the minimal security concern primarily related to namespace pollution. No evidence suggests malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple import operations with no malicious intent or activity. The use of 'import *' is a minor concern but does not constitute a security threat. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
