  "purpose": "Build configuration script for compiling a Python extension module wrapping zlib/minizip functionalities.",
  "sources": "Static C source files for zlib and minizip, including platform-specific sources; reads README.md for description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution; only static file references and build configuration.",
  "flows": "Static source paths and configuration data; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minor omission of closing the file in 'read()' function, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building a native Python extension. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The source files are static and local, and the script's purpose is solely to facilitate compilation. The minor resource leak in 'read()' is a coding style issue, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for its purpose, and free of malicious behavior or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify this and assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No adjustments are necessary.",
