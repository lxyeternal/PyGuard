  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic test suite for bcrypt and key derivation functions. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's nature. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and suitable for testing cryptographic implementations."
