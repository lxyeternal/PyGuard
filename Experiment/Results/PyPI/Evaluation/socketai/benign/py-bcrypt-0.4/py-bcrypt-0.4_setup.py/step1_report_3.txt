{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for building and installing a Python package called 'py-bcrypt', which implements bcrypt password hashing and key derivation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from variables, imports from standard and third-party modules, and source files listed in 'sources' for extension compilation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the setup() function which packages the extension; no untrusted data or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the process is confined to static data and standard package build steps.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for package setup, defines extension sources, and invokes setup() with package metadata. All operations are standard for building Python C extensions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior are identified. The code contains only static configuration data and no dynamic or user input handling, which reduces risk. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a bcrypt-related Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security concerns based on the provided content.",
