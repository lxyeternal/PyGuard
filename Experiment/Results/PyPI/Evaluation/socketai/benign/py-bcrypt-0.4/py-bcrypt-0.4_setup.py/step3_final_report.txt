  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing the 'py-bcrypt' Python package with a C extension module.",
  "sources": "Static source files listed in the 'sources' parameter of the Extension object; package metadata such as author, URL, description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "The script imports setup tools, defines a C extension with static source files, and calls setup() with fixed metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and typical for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for compiling a C extension module for bcrypt. It imports setup tools, defines source files, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. There are no dynamic inputs, network communications, or obfuscated elements. The source files are typical C files for bcrypt implementation. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring is appropriate.",
