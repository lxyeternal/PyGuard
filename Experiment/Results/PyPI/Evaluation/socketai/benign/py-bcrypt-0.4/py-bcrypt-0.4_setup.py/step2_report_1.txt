  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python C extension, with no suspicious behavior, malicious code, or data processing.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (it's a setup script, but setup scripts can sometimes be misused, so a small risk score is reasonable).  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no data flow issues. The risk score is appropriately low but not zero, given the potential for setup scripts to be misused if malicious source files are introduced.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the analysis confirms the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The low risk score is justified; no malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the setup process is standard.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the report indicates a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The code is static, straightforward, and contains no suspicious elements.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No issues detected; the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, the code is a typical package setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally very low, reflecting the nature of setup scripts.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n- The code under review is a standard Python package setup script for a bcrypt C extension.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident.  \n- The scores assigned across reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since setup scripts can theoretically be misused, but in this case, there's no evidence of such misuse)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent. The low risk score is justified, and the malware/obfuscated scores are correct.",
