{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and build a Python package called 'py-bcrypt', including compiling C extensions for bcrypt hashing functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the source files listed in the 'sources' parameter of the Extension ('bcrypt/bcrypt.c', etc.), and from the setup configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data or external communication. The script only performs package setup and compilation.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, defining extension sources, and invoking setup() with configuration parameters. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward setup script. URLs point to a deprecated domain (code.google.com), but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' and falls back to 'distutils' if unavailable, which is standard. It defines a version and creates a C extension module for bcrypt functionality, then calls setup() with package metadata and extension info. No external input processing, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script for a bcrypt library, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It primarily compiles C source files into a Python extension for password hashing.",
