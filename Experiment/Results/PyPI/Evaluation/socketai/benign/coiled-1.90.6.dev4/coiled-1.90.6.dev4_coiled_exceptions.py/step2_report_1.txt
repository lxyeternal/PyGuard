  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Content:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions.\n   - No external data input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - Exception classes have descriptive messages, error codes, and optional additional context.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n   - Minor inconsistency: In `ParseIdentifierError`, the constructor does not explicitly call `super().__init__()`, but since it sets `self.message` and then calls `super().__init__(message, *args, **kwargs)`, this is acceptable.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are evident.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely structural.\n   - No evidence of supply chain sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - No need to adjust scores; they accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-implemented set of custom exception classes.\n   - No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n   - The detailed analysis confirms the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
