{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling with structured JSON output",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializations; no external input or data reading present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points observed; only internal exception handling structures",
  "flows": "Instantiation and raising of exception objects, primarily for error reporting within the application",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious logic; code appears to be standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of custom exception classes used for error handling, with added attributes for detailed error info. No external data input, network operations, or insecure code practices detected. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code behavior present. The code strictly focuses on exception structure and messaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error reporting. It contains no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, secure pattern for error management in Python projects.",
