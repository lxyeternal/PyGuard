{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for structured error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class attributes; constructors setting message and extras; no external data input or network operations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs; exception classes are purely structural.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data flows or execute logic beyond class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Exception, with descriptive error codes and optional message and extras. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The classes are well-structured, with constructors properly setting messages and additional context. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code serves as a standard pattern for error handling, and the implementation is correct and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
