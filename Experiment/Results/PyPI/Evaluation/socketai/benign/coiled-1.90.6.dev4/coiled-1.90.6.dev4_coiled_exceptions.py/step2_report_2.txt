  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - Each class has a `code` attribute and some constructors for setting messages and additional context.\n   - No external data input, network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The code does not contain any obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious payloads.\n   - There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and secure.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely for structured error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are apparent in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given & Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Since there's no malicious or obfuscated code, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0.\n   - Given the benign nature, this is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as non-malicious, with no unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They do not speculate about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Overall Summary & Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Final Critical Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, secure implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No signs of supply chain sabotage, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I agree with the assessments provided.\n- The code is safe, benign, and appropriate for its purpose.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- No changes needed; scores and conclusions are justified.\n- Maintain the current low-risk assessment.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
