{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, providing structured error information.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code defines classes and constants only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs involving untrusted data; the code only creates exception objects and string representations.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects and calling their methods; no untrusted data flow or external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with class-level 'code' constants and basic constructors. No data input, network access, file operations, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors. All classes serve as structured error types for application error handling. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic. The structure and content appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error categorization. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. It is safe for use in a larger codebase.",
