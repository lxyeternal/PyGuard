{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling specific errors in a Python application, with enhanced error reporting capabilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from exception instantiation and message arguments, as well as class attribute values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data; no output, network, or file operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated and potentially raised elsewhere; no explicit data flow paths are visible within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured set of custom exception classes inheriting from a base class. It includes methods for representing and serializing exception details. No input/output, network, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The exception classes and their attributes are standard and straightforward. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
