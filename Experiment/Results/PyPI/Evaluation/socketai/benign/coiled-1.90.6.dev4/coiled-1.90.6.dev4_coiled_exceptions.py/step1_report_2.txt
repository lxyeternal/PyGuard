{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Python application, with additional metadata and error codes for specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute initializations within the module.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "None of the code demonstrates data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions with descriptive messages and error codes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various custom exceptions that inherit from a base exception class. Each class has a unique 'code' attribute and some constructors that initialize messages and additional context. There are no inputs, external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for error handling in Python projects. No signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or supply chain sabotage are evident. The code is simple, well-structured, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a structured way to handle errors in an application without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
