{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, with enhanced information for debugging and logging.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, class attributes, and class initializers.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling and representation methods that output error messages, but no untrusted data is directly used in security-sensitive contexts.",
  "flows": "Input data (error messages, parameters) flow into exception constructors and are included in exception representations, but there are no external or untrusted data sources affecting logic or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python class and exception constructs without obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes primarily for categorizing different error types in an application. It includes constructors that set error messages and additional metadata. There are no external data sources, network calls, or code execution based on user input. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure is straightforward, serving as a clean exception management system without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a safe and typical pattern used in Python applications.",
