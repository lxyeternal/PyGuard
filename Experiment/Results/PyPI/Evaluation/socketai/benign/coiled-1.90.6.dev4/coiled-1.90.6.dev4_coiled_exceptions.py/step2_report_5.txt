  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a set of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with some constructors adding metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely for structured error handling.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are consistent with the code analysis, which shows no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely for defining exception classes; it does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n   - No external data, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is appropriate, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports base their conclusion on the code's structure and content, not on assumptions.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores or analysis.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk in this context)\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the detailed analysis.",
