The security risk is minimal, primarily related to operational configuration (e.g., insecure connections), and the malware score is zero. The overall risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects typical operational concerns rather than malicious intent."

The syntax error in '_callstack_item' should be fixed for correct operation. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate; the risk score of 0.2 reflects potential privacy concerns but no active security threat."

The dynamic config access is typical and safe if the configuration source is trusted. The low risk score (0.1) is justified, and no further action is necessary."

      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the insecure pattern of fetching and executing remote code without validation, signature verification, or sandboxing. This pattern can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, and supply chain attacks. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate, and this pattern should be considered a critical security vulnerability."
