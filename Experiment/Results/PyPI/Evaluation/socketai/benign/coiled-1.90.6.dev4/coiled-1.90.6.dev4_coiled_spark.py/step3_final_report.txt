  "purpose": "Manage Spark cluster components (master, worker, connect) via subprocess commands, environment variables, and Dask plugins within a distributed environment.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., SPARK_HOME, PYSPARK_PYTHON), scheduler info (host, port), scheduler's worker data, configuration dictionaries for Spark settings.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands to launch Spark processes, setting environment variables, network connections for Spark components, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and scheduler info feed into command strings and environment setups, which are then executed via subprocess to control Spark components.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic command construction from scheduler data and environment variables, but all data appears controlled; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. Warnings about insecure connections are operational notices, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code manages Spark cluster lifecycle through subprocess calls with controlled variables, setting environment variables for Spark configuration, and integrating with Dask via plugins. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. Subprocess commands are constructed using shlex.split, mitigating injection risks. Warnings about insecure connections are operational, not malicious. The code's structure and behavior align with standard cluster orchestration practices, with no obfuscation or malicious routines detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Spark cluster management script with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to operational configuration (e.g., insecure connections), and the malware score is zero. The overall risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects typical operational concerns rather than malicious intent.",
