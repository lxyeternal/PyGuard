  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Spark cluster management script with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to operational configuration (e.g., insecure connections), and the malware score is zero. The overall risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects typical operational concerns rather than malicious intent."
