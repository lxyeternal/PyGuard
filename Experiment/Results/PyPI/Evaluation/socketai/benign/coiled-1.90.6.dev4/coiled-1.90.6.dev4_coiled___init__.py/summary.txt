  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Python module for managing Coiled platform interactions. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The dynamic config access is typical and safe if the configuration source is trusted. The low risk score (0.1) is justified, and no further action is necessary."
