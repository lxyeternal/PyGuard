  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dependency management utility designed for environment auditing. It does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The primary security considerations involve potential information leakage through subprocess calls and URL parsing, which are standard in such tools. The malware score should be 0, and the overall security risk remains low to moderate, consistent with the detailed analysis."
