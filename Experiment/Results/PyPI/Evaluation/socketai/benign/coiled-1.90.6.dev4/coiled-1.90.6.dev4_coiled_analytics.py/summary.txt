  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the insecure pattern of fetching and executing remote code without validation, signature verification, or sandboxing. This pattern can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, and supply chain attacks. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate, and this pattern should be considered a critical security vulnerability."
