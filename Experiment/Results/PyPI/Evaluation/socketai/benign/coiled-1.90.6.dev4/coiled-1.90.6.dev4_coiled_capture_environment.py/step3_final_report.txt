{
  "purpose": "The code manages Python environment dependencies, fetching package info, approximating dependencies, creating wheels, and setting up environments in a cloud context.",
  "sources": "System info (platform, sys.prefix), user inputs (package lists), cloud API responses (dependency resolution, environment creation).",
  "sinks": "Cloud API endpoints for dependency resolution and environment setup, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Source data (local system info, package lists) -> cloud API calls for dependency resolution -> environment creation and package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. External API reliance is standard but could be a vector if compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment management tasks using standard libraries and cloud APIs. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External interactions are typical for such tools. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured environment management utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk reflects external dependency reliance but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
