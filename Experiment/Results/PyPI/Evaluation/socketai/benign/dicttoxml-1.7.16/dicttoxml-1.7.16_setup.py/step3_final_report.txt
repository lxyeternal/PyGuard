  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in filename 'LICENCE.txt' instead of 'LICENSE.txt'; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using 'distutils.core.setup' to package a Python module. It reads a README file for description and supplies static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The only minor issue is the typo in the license filename, which does not impact security but should be corrected for proper packaging. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and risk scores of 0. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and transparency of the code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor typo does not affect security. All evidence supports a conclusion of no malware, no obfuscation, and negligible risk.",
