  "flows": "File reading source to 'long_description' variable, used in setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from distutils.core to configure packaging. It reads 'README.md' for a long description, which is standard. No dynamic code execution, no input from untrusted sources, and no sensitive data handling. No external or malicious calls are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup script conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
