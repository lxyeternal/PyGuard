{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to print colored text to the console, with specific handling for Windows systems to change text attributes using Windows API calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system platform via 'from platform import system' and the input parameter 'text' for printing.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the console via print statements and Windows API functions to change console text attributes.",
  "flows": "The 'system()' function determines platform; on Windows, API calls set console text color; finally, text is printed. The color change is an indirect sink influenced by platform detection.",
  "anomalies": "The use of Windows API calls to change console text attributes is complex but standard for colored output; no hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a license comment and imports the 'system' function. The 'colored_print' function detects the OS. On Windows, it uses 'ctypes' to access Windows console API functions to change text attributes, setting color to green before printing, then restoring original attributes. On other OSes, it uses ANSI escape codes for green text. All operations are standard for cross-platform colored output. No external data inputs, network operations, or malicious behaviors are present. The API calls are used solely for aesthetic console output.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for printing colored text to the console across different operating systems. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. It is a well-structured, benign utility code.",
