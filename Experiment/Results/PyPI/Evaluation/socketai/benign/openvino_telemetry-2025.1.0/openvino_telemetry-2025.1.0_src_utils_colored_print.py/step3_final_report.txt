  "purpose": "Prints colored text to the console with platform-specific handling for Windows and other OSes.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'text' (input text to be printed). No external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs to stdout; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows directly into the print statement after platform-specific color handling; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard APIs and straightforward logic. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and applies appropriate console coloring methods: on Windows, it uses ctypes to call Windows API functions to change console text attributes temporarily; on other OSes, it uses ANSI escape sequences. The implementation is correct, clear, and uses standard libraries. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. The purpose is purely cosmetic, and the code does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence in benignity. No vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors are observed or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for printing colored console text, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
