{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to print colored text to the console, with platform-specific handling for Windows and non-Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via 'platform.system()' to determine platform type; reads no other external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Uses Windows API functions 'GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo', 'SetConsoleTextAttribute', and standard print function, but these are safe if used correctly.",
  "flows": "Retrieves console state, modifies console text attributes for Windows, then restores original attributes; on non-Windows, outputs colored text using ANSI escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The code uses standard libraries and system APIs for console formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly identifies the platform and adjusts console output accordingly, without performing any network communication, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations. Usage of Windows API functions is appropriate for console formatting. No untrusted data is processed, and there are no hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of cross-platform colored printing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
