{
  "purpose": "The code provides a cross-platform method to print colored text to the console, specifically green text, by using Windows API calls on Windows and ANSI escape codes on other platforms.",
  "sources": "The code reads the platform type using platform.system() and accesses Windows console buffer info via ctypes functions.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs text to the console using print(), which is a benign sink in this context.",
  "flows": "Platform check -> Conditional branch -> Windows API calls (if Windows) or ANSI escape code (if not) -> Output to console",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic behaviors. The Windows API calls are standard for changing console colors. No obfuscated or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script detects the operating system. On Windows, it uses ctypes to access kernel32.dll functions to modify console text attributes, specifically to change text color to green. On other platforms, it uses ANSI escape sequences to color the text. All API calls and imports are legitimate and standard for console color manipulation. No external data inputs, no network activity, no credential handling, no malware indicators. The code appears solely to enhance console output appearance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for colored console output with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is well-structured, and its purpose is straightforward. No malicious behavior or supply chain threats are detected.",
