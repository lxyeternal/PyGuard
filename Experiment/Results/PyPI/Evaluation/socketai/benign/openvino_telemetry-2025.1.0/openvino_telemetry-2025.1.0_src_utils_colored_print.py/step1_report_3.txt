{
  "purpose": "The function colored_print outputs colored text to the console, with platform-specific handling for Windows and other systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform.system() and console buffer info via windll.kernel32.GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo.",
  "sinks": "The code writes console text attributes with windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTextAttribute, affecting terminal display.",
  "flows": "System info (platform) is used to decide whether to modify console attributes. If Windows, it retrieves current console attributes, sets a new attribute for color, prints text, then restores previous attributes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The use of Windows API functions appears to be standard for colored output handling.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the operating system and conditionally uses Windows API calls to change console text attributes for colored output. On non-Windows platforms, it uses ANSI escape codes. The Windows API usage is proper for console coloring, and no external data input or insecure operations are present. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code performs a benign task with standard system libraries and API calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation for colored console output, employing platform-specific methods. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
