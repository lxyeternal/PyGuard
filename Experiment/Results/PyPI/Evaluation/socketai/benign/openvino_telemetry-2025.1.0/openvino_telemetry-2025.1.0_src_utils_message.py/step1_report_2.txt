  "purpose": "Defines message types and a message class for handling structured messages with type and attributes.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input reading or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or data processing vulnerable to injection or leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for message types and a simple class that initializes with a message type and a dictionary of attributes, copying the input dictionary to avoid external mutation. No external inputs, data flows, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears straightforward and intended for message handling within a larger system. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for message categorization and encapsulation. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
