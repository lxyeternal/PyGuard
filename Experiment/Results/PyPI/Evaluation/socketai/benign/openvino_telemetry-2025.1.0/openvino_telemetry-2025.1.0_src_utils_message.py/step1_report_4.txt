  "purpose": "Define message types and a message class for categorization and data storage.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the attrs parameter passed to the Message constructor.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak could occur if attrs contains sensitive information and is mishandled, but no explicit sink is present in the code.",
  "flows": "Attributes are copied into the Message object; no external data flow or processing evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for message types and a class to encapsulate messages with a type and associated attributes. It copies the attrs dictionary to prevent external modification, which is a good practice. No input/output operations, network communications, or dangerous code constructs are present. The code appears to be part of a message handling system and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious data structure setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
