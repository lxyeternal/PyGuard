{
  "purpose": "Defines message types and a message class for categorizing and storing message attributes, serving as a data structure for message handling or logging.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code initializes enum members and copies attribute dictionaries during object creation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (type and attrs) into object attributes, with attrs being copied to prevent external modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard enum and class definitions, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum for message types and a Message class that copies the attrs dictionary during initialization. It does not perform any input validation, network operations, or data leaks. The copying of attrs is a good practice to prevent external mutation. No malicious, suspicious, or maliciously obfuscated code is present. The code is a benign, standard data container with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data class for message categorization. There are no signs of malicious activity, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, and the overall assessment indicates no security concerns.",
