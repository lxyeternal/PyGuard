{
  "purpose": "Defines message types and a message class for handling message attributes, likely for logging or communication within a system.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, enum members, and the attrs dictionary passed to Message instances.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The use of Enum and copying attributes appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class for message types and a Message class that stores a message type and attributes, copying the attrs dictionary to prevent external modifications. No untrusted input handling, external data reads, or dangerous operations are present. The code appears to serve a benign purpose, possibly for internal message management or logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, safe, and appears to serve a standard purpose without any malicious intent or security risks.",
