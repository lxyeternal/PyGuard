{
  "purpose": "Define message types and a message class for handling different types of messages, likely in a logging or communication context.",
  "sources": "Constants in the Enum class and the attrs dictionary provided during Message object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of attrs data if manipulated or sent over networks or stored insecurely, but none explicitly shown in code.",
  "flows": "Attrs data is copied during Message instantiation; no further data flow or processing shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. Enum usage and copying of attrs are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class, defines an enumeration for message types with clear integer mappings, and a Message class that initializes with a message type and a dictionary of attributes. The constructor copies attrs to prevent external modification. No input validation, network activity, or insecure operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward data structure setup for messaging or logging, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data definition for message handling with no malicious or security concerns detected. It is well-structured and free of suspicious behavior.",
