{
  "purpose": "Defines module exports and version information for a telemetry component in a package, likely for tracking or analytics.",
  "sources": "The module imports Telemetry from a local .main module and accesses Telemetry.get_version().",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data are present; no data output or network connections are evident.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves version info from Telemetry.get_version() but does not process external input or data flows beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. License comment and version assignment are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up __all__ for module exports, imports a Telemetry class, and retrieves a version string via a class method. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious activities are detectable. The code appears standard and benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The only external dependency is the local .main module, which seems typical for a structured project.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It only exposes a Telemetry class and version info, with no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
