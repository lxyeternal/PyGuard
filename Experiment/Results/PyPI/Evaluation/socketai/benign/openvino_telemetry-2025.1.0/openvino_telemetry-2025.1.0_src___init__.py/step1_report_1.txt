{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports and import a Telemetry class to access its version.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own version information via Telemetry.get_version() and imports Telemetry from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or user input; no data is sent or received in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports Telemetry and then calls Telemetry.get_version() to assign __version__, which is a simple attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ for module exports, imports Telemetry from a local module, and retrieves version information via Telemetry.get_version(). There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The only potentially relevant point is the use of Telemetry, which could involve data collection, but that depends on the implementation of Telemetry, not this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving to define module exports and retrieve version info. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this code alone.",
