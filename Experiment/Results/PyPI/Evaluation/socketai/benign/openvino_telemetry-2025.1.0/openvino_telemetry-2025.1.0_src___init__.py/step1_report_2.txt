{
  "purpose": "Defines module exports and retrieves the version of the Telemetry component.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __all__ list for module exports and imports the Telemetry class from a local module; also calls Telemetry.get_version() to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "The call to Telemetry.get_version() could potentially retrieve sensitive version information, but as it is a method call, the risk depends on the implementation of get_version().",
  "flows": "Imports Telemetry from the local module, then calls Telemetry.get_version() to assign to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module export and version retrieval pattern. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Telemetry class and exposes it via __all__. It then calls Telemetry.get_version() to set the __version__ variable. All operations are straightforward and typical for a module setup. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only concern could be the implementation of Telemetry.get_version(), which is not provided here, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup that imports and exposes the Telemetry class and retrieves version info. There is no malicious behavior or security risk evident in this fragment.",
