  "purpose": "Defines public API exposure for a module and retrieves its version via the Telemetry class.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Telemetry class from local module '.main'. Access to Telemetry.get_version().",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data outputs, network connections, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import of Telemetry class -> Calling Telemetry.get_version() -> Setting __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class from a local module and assigns a version string to __version__ by calling a method of that class. There are no data inputs, external connections, or suspicious behaviors present. The structure appears straightforward, typical of a module's version definition, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module initializer that exposes a version number. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks are identified.",
