{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up exports for a Telemetry module and retrieves its version.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Telemetry from a relative module, and the call to Telemetry.get_version()",
  "sinks": "None directly, as the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any data leak operations",
  "flows": "The module imports Telemetry and uses its get_version() method to assign __version__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data flows or behaviors; only a simple import and attribute access",
  "analysis": "The code defines an export list, imports a Telemetry class, and retrieves its version number. No data is processed from external sources, nor are there any dangerous functions called. The import path suggests modular code organization. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It simply exports the Telemetry class and its version.",
