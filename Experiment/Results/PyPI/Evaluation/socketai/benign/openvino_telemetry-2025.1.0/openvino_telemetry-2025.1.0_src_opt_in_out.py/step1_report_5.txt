  "purpose": "The script manages user telemetry preferences by allowing users to opt in or out of anonymous data collection.",
  "sources": "Command line arguments '--opt_in' and '--opt_out' which determine user preference input.",
  "sinks": "Functions 'tm.Telemetry.opt_in' and 'tm.Telemetry.opt_out' which send user preferences to a telemetry service.",
  "flows": "User provides '--opt_in' or '--opt_out' via command line -> corresponding function is called with a fixed telemetry ID.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded telemetry ID ('G-W5E9RNLD4H'), but no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. No unusual code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for setting telemetry preferences. It imports 'openvino_telemetry' and calls its methods based on user input. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The hardcoded telemetry ID could be seen as a privacy concern, but not malicious. No obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple telemetry preference manager with no malicious intent. It only interacts with an external telemetry library based on user command line input. There are no security risks or malware present.",
