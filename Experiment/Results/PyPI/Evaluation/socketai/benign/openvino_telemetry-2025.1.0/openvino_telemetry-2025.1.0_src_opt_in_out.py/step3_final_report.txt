  "purpose": "Manage user telemetry preferences via command-line options, enabling or disabling anonymous data transmission.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments '--opt_in' and '--opt_out', and the static telemetry ID 'G-W5E9RNLD4H'.",
  "sinks": "External functions 'tm.Telemetry.opt_in' and 'tm.Telemetry.opt_out' which likely transmit telemetry data.",
  "flows": "User inputs '--opt_in' or '--opt_out' -> code calls corresponding telemetry function with static ID -> potential data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors; straightforward argument parsing and external function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that sets telemetry preferences, calling external functions with a fixed ID. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The external telemetry functions may transmit data, but this aligns with their purpose and is not malicious. The static ID is not suspicious. The argument validation is correct, and no security flaws are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero; the privacy concern is minimal and typical for telemetry scripts. The overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily privacy-related, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving as a telemetry preference manager. No malicious intent or behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature. The primary concern is privacy, not security or malware.",
