  "purpose": "This script manages user telemetry preferences for OpenVINO, allowing users to opt in or out of anonymous data collection.",
  "sources": "Command line arguments (--opt_in and --opt_out) that determine user choice.",
  "sinks": "Telemetry functions (tm.Telemetry.opt_in and tm.Telemetry.opt_out) that send data to a remote telemetry service with a fixed telemetry ID.",
  "flows": "User provides command line argument -> script determines choice -> calls telemetry API with fixed ID to set preference.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded telemetry ID ('G-W5E9RNLD4H') could be considered a static identifier, but not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code processes command line arguments to set user telemetry preferences. It imports the openvino_telemetry module and calls functions to opt in or out. No data is being leaked or transmitted outside of the intended telemetry service. The use of a static ID is typical for telemetry identification and does not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard telemetry configuration utility for OpenVINO, with no signs of malicious behavior. It responsibly manages user choice for data collection and communicates with a telemetry API using a fixed identifier. No malicious intent detected.",
