  "flows": "No data flows exist in this static comment block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present; the snippet is straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a non-executable comment containing licensing info. No code, data sources, sinks, or flows are present. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected. The content is benign and standard for open source projects. Given the absence of executable code or data handling, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, metadata-only comment with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain as is.",
