{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to package the openvino-telemetry library, including custom build steps and dynamic version retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version via Telemetry.get_version() during setup execution.",
  "sinks": "The call to Telemetry.get_version() can execute arbitrary code if implemented maliciously.",
  "flows": "The setup() function invokes Telemetry.get_version(), which may execute code depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Calling a method during setup that could execute arbitrary code is a potential security concern; no obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard packaging script with a custom build class. The main concern is the invocation of Telemetry.get_version() during setup, which could execute malicious code if the method is insecurely implemented. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The risk depends entirely on the implementation of Telemetry. The scores from reports are conservative, assigning low malware (0.2) and moderate security risk (0.4). Given the lack of evidence, the implementation of get_version() should be reviewed to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is standard for packaging, with the primary security concern being the execution of potentially untrusted code during setup via Telemetry.get_version(). Without inspecting the implementation, the risk remains speculative but warrants caution. The overall malware and obfuscation scores are low; the security risk score should be moderate if the implementation is untrusted. The package should be reviewed before distribution, especially the get_version() method.",
