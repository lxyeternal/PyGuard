  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the openvino_telemetry library, including custom build behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing 'Telemetry' from 'src.main'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'Telemetry' and calling 'Telemetry.get_version()' during setup, potentially executing code from 'src.main'.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically calls 'Telemetry.get_version()', which may execute arbitrary code. The 'Telemetry' class's implementation is not provided, raising potential concern if it contains malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup using setuptools, defining custom build steps and reading a README file for description. The key point of concern is the call to 'Telemetry.get_version()' during setup, which could execute code within 'Telemetry'. No other suspicious code or obfuscated constructs are present. The use of 'Telemetry' suggests telemetry-related functionality, which is generally expected in this context. However, since 'Telemetry' is imported from 'src.main', its implementation is unknown; if it contains malicious code, it could be executed during package build. The script does not perform any network activity or system modifications directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with a potential security concern revolving around the execution of 'Telemetry.get_version()'. If 'Telemetry.get_version()' contains malicious code, it could lead to unintended execution during package build. Without the implementation details of 'Telemetry', the risk cannot be fully determined, but the pattern of executing code during setup is noteworthy.",
