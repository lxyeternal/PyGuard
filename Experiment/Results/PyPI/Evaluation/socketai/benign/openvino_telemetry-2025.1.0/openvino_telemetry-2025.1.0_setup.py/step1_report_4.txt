{
  "purpose": "The script is used to create a Python package distribution (wheel) for the openvino_telemetry library, including custom build steps.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; importing modules such as setuptools and src.main.Telemetry; executing setup() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() which handles package building and metadata; calling Telemetry.get_version() to get version info.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> importing Telemetry -> calling Telemetry.get_version() -> executing setup() with package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Telemetry.get_version() during setup; no direct user input handling or network operations; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; the code appears standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup and distribution, importing the Telemetry class from src.main and calling its get_version() method for versioning. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed. The custom build class filters test modules from packaging. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard setuptools functions and straightforward package metadata indicates typical package setup behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with a custom build command to exclude test modules. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It appears to be legitimate code for packaging the telemetry library with no signs of malicious behavior.",
