  "conclusion": "The code itself is standard for packaging, with the primary security concern being the execution of potentially untrusted code during setup via Telemetry.get_version(). Without inspecting the implementation, the risk remains speculative but warrants caution. The overall malware and obfuscation scores are low; the security risk score should be moderate if the implementation is untrusted. The package should be reviewed before distribution, especially the get_version() method."
