{
  "purpose": "This script is used to package the telemetry library for distribution, including creating source and wheel distributions, and setting up package metadata and build instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing setup-related modules, and importing the Telemetry class from src.main.",
  "sinks": "Calling Telemetry.get_version() to determine package version; no direct data sinks for untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "The code reads the version via Telemetry.get_version(), then proceeds with package setup, which is standard for packaging scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script mainly handles packaging setup, with a custom build command filtering test modules.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package. It imports and uses the Telemetry class to obtain version info, which could potentially be malicious if the Telemetry class is compromised. The custom build command filters out test modules during packaging. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or code that executes untrusted input. The structure and content are consistent with standard packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging the openvino-telemetry library. The only potential concern is reliance on Telemetry.get_version(), which depends on the implementation of the Telemetry class in src.main. Without examining src.main, there are no clear signs of malicious activity in this script itself.",
