{
  "purpose": "The script generates color map images and updates documentation files with references to these images for various palette modules.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from external palette modules imported via import_module, and from file reads for template processing and file system checks.",
  "sinks": "File writes to create images and documentation pages, and dynamic module imports. No untrusted data directly influences sensitive system commands or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Module imports -> Palette extraction -> Image generation -> Template rendering -> File writing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of dynamic import_module is standard but could be misused if modules are compromised; however, this is typical for plugin-like systems.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific palette modules dynamically, extracts Palette objects, and generates corresponding images, saving them to disk. It also renders documentation pages using templates. The process is straightforward and relies on standard library functions and predictable external modules. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All file and directory operations are local. The script performs predictable, benign operations focused on static asset generation and documentation updates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for generating palette images and documentation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It functions as a standard static asset generator without any signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
