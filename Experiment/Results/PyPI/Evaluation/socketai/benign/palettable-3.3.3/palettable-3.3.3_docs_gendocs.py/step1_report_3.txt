{
  "purpose": "The script generates color map images and documentation pages for a collection of color palettes, facilitating visualization and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads modules via import_module, reads files such as 'index.md.tpl' from the filesystem, and potentially reads palette data from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Writes images to the filesystem (in 'img' directory), writes rendered markdown documentation ('index.md'), and loads template files for rendering.",
  "flows": "Imports modules to retrieve palette objects -> Generates images for palettes -> Renders documentation page using template and palette data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses import_module on module names from a predefined list, reads a template file, and writes output files. No user input handling or network activity observed. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform straightforward file and image processing tasks: importing color palette modules, generating palette images, and rendering documentation pages. It employs standard library functions and external libraries (jinja2, palettable). The use of import_module and file I/O is typical for such build scripts. No suspicious code behavior, network activity, or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present. It is a utility script for visualization and documentation generation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build utility for color palette visualization and documentation. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident based on static analysis. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
