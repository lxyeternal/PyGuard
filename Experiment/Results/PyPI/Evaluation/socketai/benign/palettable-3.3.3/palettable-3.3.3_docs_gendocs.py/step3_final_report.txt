{
  "purpose": "This script loads color palette modules, generates corresponding images, and updates documentation files to include references to these images.",
  "sources": "Module import via import_module, reading template files, accessing palette objects, and reading/writing image and markdown files.",
  "sinks": "Writing image files and documentation files; no untrusted data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported dynamically, palettes are extracted, images are generated and saved, and documentation templates are rendered and written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of import_module is controlled and predictable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for generating palette images and updating documentation. It uses standard libraries and external packages without obfuscation or malicious code. No network activity or secret handling is present. Dynamic import_module is used with predefined module names, which is safe in this context. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured utility for palette visualization and documentation. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The initial risk and malware scores are overestimated; they should be set to 0 to accurately reflect the code's safety.",
