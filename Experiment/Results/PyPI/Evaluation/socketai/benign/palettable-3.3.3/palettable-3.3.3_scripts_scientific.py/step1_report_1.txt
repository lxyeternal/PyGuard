  "purpose": "Convert RGB data from text files with float values (0-1) into a Python list format with integer values (0-255) for color mapping.",
  "sources": "Reading input filenames from command line arguments; opening each file in read mode.",
  "sinks": "Writing processed color data into an output file specified by the user.",
  "flows": "Input filenames -> read_rgb_txt() reads and converts data -> process_file() writes formatted data to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The script converts RGB float values to integers and formats them into Python tuples within a file. It uses standard libraries and 'click' for command-line interaction. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification observed. The code performs data transformation without executing external commands or accessing sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for data formatting with no signs of malicious behavior. It is safe based on the provided content.",
