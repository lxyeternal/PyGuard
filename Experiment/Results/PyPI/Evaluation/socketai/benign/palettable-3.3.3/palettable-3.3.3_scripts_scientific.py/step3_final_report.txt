  "purpose": "Convert RGB float values (0-1) from text files into Python list format with integer (0-255) RGB values.",
  "sources": "Reads text files containing RGB float values line by line.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted Python tuples to an output file.",
  "flows": "Reads each line from input files, converts float components to integers, and writes as tuples into the destination file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external network activity, no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward data transformation: it reads RGB float values from text files, converts each component to an integer in the 0-255 range, and writes the data as Python tuples. It uses standard libraries and the 'click' package for CLI. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The logic is transparent and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for data formatting with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
