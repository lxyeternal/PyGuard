{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'filters' object or module from a local 'filters' package or module within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import in Python, importing 'filters' from a local module or package named 'filters'. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no external interactions, data flows, or suspicious patterns. The code's simplicity and clarity support a conclusion of no malicious intent or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
