{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for palette management, including creating, splitting, and printing color palette names and data, as well as functions to generate palettes from data for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from standard input and system information (sys.version_info), and from sequences or dictionaries passed as parameters (names, data, lengths).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily manipulates and outputs palette data and names. The only output is through print statements in print_maps().",
  "flows": "Input data (names, lengths, color data) flows into functions to create palettes and name mappings. The get_map_factory creates palette objects from data, which could be used for visualization or further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, network access, file operations, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for palette creation and management. It uses safe data manipulations, standard library functions, and string formatting. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated code are present. The functions are self-contained and serve their purpose of palette handling without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility library for color palette management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It provides standard functions for data processing and output formatting relevant to palette handling.",
