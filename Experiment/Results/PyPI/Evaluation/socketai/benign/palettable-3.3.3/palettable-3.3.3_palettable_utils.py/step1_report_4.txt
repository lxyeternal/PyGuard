  "purpose": "Utility functions for palette creation, manipulation, and display, primarily for color map generation.",
  "sources": "Constants, standard library functions, and method parameters such as 'names', 'names_and_lengths', and 'name' strings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; functions mainly generate and print palette information or create palette objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions (like 'names', 'names_and_lengths', 'name') flow into data processing, with no indication of data being sent externally or used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Use of dynamic string formatting and data structures appears standard. No obfuscated code or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for palette management, including generating names, creating maps, and printing palettes. All data manipulations involve predictable string handling and list comprehensions, with no external or untrusted data handling, network calls, or secret data storage. No signs of malicious behavior, malicious side effects, or security risks identified. The functions are well-structured and serve legitimate purposes within a visualization or color mapping context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for palette management, with no malicious intent or security risks present based on the provided code. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, and the data flows are safe.",
