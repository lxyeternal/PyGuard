  "purpose": "A utility function that formats a date/datetime object into a string using a specified format.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'value' which is expected to be a date/datetime object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows into 'value.strftime(format)', producing a formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard library functions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple date formatting function that calls 'strftime' on the input 'value'. It registers this function in a 'filters' dictionary. There are no external inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, standard, and serves as a utility. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are justified given the benign nature. The confidence level is high (1) due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for date formatting with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
