{
  "purpose": "Define a simple date formatting function and register it in a filters dictionary.",
  "sources": "The function uses the 'value' parameter, which is expected to be a date object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is written or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is passed into 'strftime' to produce a formatted date string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'dateformat' that formats a date object using strftime with a specified format. The function is registered in a dictionary 'filters'. There are no input sources that handle external untrusted data, nor are there any data sinks or flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or use environment variables. It is a simple utility function with standard behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a straightforward purpose of date formatting. No malicious or security-risky behavior is present.",
