{
  "purpose": "Import future features, modules, and functions related to palettes and maps, likely for visualization or graphical purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, relative imports from parent modules, and a call to utils.load_all_palettes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potential data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "The code loads palettes via utils.load_all_palettes and updates globals, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports, which is normal; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls detected. The load_all_palettes function's behavior is not shown, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of imports and updating globals with data loaded from a utility function. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern could be the behavior of utils.load_all_palettes, but without its implementation, we cannot assess its security impact. The use of relative imports and standard import patterns do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup for importing and initializing palette data. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on the provided snippet.",
