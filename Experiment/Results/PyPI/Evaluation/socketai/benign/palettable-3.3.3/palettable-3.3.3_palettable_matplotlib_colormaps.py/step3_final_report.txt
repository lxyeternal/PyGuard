  "purpose": "Static definition of colormap data arrays (_MAGMA_DATA, _INFERNO_DATA, _PLASMA_DATA, _VIRIDIS_DATA) for visualization in matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Predefined RGB triplet arrays embedded directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static data used solely for visualization purposes.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; data arrays are straightforward, derived from known sources, with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static RGB data arrays with no functions, external dependencies, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data flow. Licensing comments indicate open-source attribution. The data is used for colormap definitions in visualization libraries. All indicators point to benign, static data intended for visual representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static dataset for colormap definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are consistent with the content.",
