  "purpose": "Define color map data arrays for visualizations in matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Constant variables (_MAGMA_DATA, _INFERNO_DATA, _PLASMA_DATA, _VIRIDIS_DATA) containing RGB triplets, static data only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed; no data output, external calls, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data arrays are static and used directly for colormap definitions; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. No external network calls or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains static RGB data arrays used to define colormaps for visualization purposes. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. The data appears to be standard colormap data derived from known sources. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, data leakage, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is simple and static, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of colormap datasets for visualization; it does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and solely intended for graphical rendering.",
