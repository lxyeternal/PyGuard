  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code contains only static data arrays (_MAGMA_DATA, _INFERNO_DATA, etc.) used for colormap definitions. No dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious activity detected.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is accurate; the code is benign. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.  \n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is static data for colormaps, with no external interactions or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the data is static, and the reasoning is sound. The scores are reasonable.  \n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, static data definitions for colormaps with clear attribution and no suspicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is benign is justified. The assigned scores are appropriate.  \n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; static, well-documented data arrays for colormaps, no external or malicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the data is standard and safe.  \n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; static data for visualization, no external data or malicious behavior.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion and scores are appropriate.  \n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code only contains static RGB data arrays for colormap definitions.  \n- **Malware/malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or hidden code features.  \n- **Security risk:** Zero, as the code is purely data definitions with no external interactions.\n\n### Final Score Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, static data)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, static dataset for colormap visualization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a standard, open-source colormap data definition file with no security concerns.",
