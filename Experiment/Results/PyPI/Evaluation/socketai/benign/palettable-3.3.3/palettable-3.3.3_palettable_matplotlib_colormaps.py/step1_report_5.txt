{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple color map data arrays for visualization purposes, likely used to generate color gradients in plotting libraries like Matplotlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined color arrays (_MAGMA_DATA, _INFERNO_DATA, _PLASMA_DATA, _VIRIDIS_DATA). There are no user inputs, environment variables, or external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data output operations, network connections, file writes, or other sinks that could be exploited for malicious data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the data is static, hardcoded within the script and used for color mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The arrays are standard data structures for colormap definitions. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static data definitions for colormap data points, with clear, unencrypted arrays representing color gradient mappings. The structure is straightforward and typical for such visualization data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns. The comments and licensing information are standard and provide context for the data source. The absence of executable logic, network operations, or user input indicates no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign collection of static color map data arrays intended for visualization. It poses no security threats, malicious intent, or supply chain risks. The data is publicly sourced and used as intended for plotting purposes.",
