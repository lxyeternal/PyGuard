  "purpose": "Define various color map data arrays for visualization purposes in matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded color data arrays for colormaps (_MAGMA_DATA, _INFERNO_DATA, _PLASMA_DATA, _VIRIDIS_DATA). No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources or network operations; the code only defines static data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the data arrays are static and do not interact with external systems or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static data definitions for color maps, with descriptive comments and licensing information. No functions, external calls, or data manipulations are present. The data appears to be precomputed color values for visualization, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious code insertion. The license comments clarify the open-source nature and attribution, with no evidence of tampering or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for defining static colormap data for visualization. There are no signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks. It is safe to use and contains no suspicious behaviors.",
