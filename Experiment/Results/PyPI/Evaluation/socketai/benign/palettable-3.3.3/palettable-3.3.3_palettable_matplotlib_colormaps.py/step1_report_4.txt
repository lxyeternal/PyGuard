{
  "purpose": "The code defines various color map data arrays for visualizations in matplotlib, specifically for colormaps like magma, inferno, plasma, and viridis.",
  "sources": "The data arrays (_MAGMA_DATA, _INFERNO_DATA, _PLASMA_DATA, _VIRIDIS_DATA) are hardcoded within the script. The script does not read external inputs or user data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network communication, file writing, or execution of untrusted data; the code solely contains static data definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes static color data variables with no further data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists of large static data arrays for color maps, which appear to be standard color map datasets. No obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or hidden code segments are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a data definition file for color map datasets used in matplotlib visualizations. It includes metadata comments indicating source attribution and licensing information. The data arrays are static, hardcoded, and follow expected formats for color map data points. There is no indication of malicious code, dynamic behavior, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is purely to provide color map data, with no external data dependencies or network activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dataset for colormap definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard, open-source color map data file, aligned with its intended visualization purpose.",
