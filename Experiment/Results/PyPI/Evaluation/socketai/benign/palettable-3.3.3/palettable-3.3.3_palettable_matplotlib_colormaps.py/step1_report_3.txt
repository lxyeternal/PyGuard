{
  "purpose": "The code defines several color map data arrays used for visualizations in matplotlib, providing color gradient data for colormaps like magma, inferno, plasma, and viridis.",
  "sources": "The data arrays (_MAGMA_DATA, _INFERNO_DATA, _PLASMA_DATA, _VIRIDIS_DATA) are hardcoded within the script, serving as color gradient definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points in the code where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted input could influence execution or data flow.",
  "flows": "The data arrays are statically defined; no dynamic data flow from external sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static definition of color map data arrays used for matplotlib visualizations. The data is hardcoded and appears to be precomputed color gradients. There are no input/output operations, no network communication, and no dynamic code execution. The arrays are simply assigned to variables, with no sign of malicious payloads or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code is benign, purely data definitions for color maps.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign collection of static color map data arrays used for visualization purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate part of an open-source library for colormap definitions.",
