{
  "purpose": "To provide access to various color maps for visualization in Python.",
  "sources": "The code imports multiple modules within the package, potentially reading local module files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module imports and versioning.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscation or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing multiple modules related to color maps and setting a version string. It does not perform any input/output operations, network communications, or data manipulations. All imports appear to be local modules, and the version assignment is standard. There are no signs of malicious activity, code injection, or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module initializer with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
