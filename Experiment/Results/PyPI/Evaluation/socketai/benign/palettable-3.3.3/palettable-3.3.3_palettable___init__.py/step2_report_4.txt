  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports multiple submodules related to color maps and sets a version string.\n- No dynamic data processing, external data sources, network activity, or user input handling.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- All imports are local modules, typical for a package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a simple import and variable assignment, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None. The code is standard for a package's `__init__.py` or module entry point.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Given the benign nature, the malware score should be **0**. The reports correctly assign 0 across all reports.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  No obfuscation is present, so 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since there's no malicious activity, no external data handling, or security concerns, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n- No reason exists to assign a higher score because:\n  - No malware or malicious intent.\n  - No suspicious or obfuscated code.\n  - No external data or network activity.\n  - No security vulnerabilities evident from this snippet.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, which aligns with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and typical for a Python package. The reports are consistent, and no adjustments are necessary.",
