  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Django bootstrap file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The potential security concern is the execution of arbitrary commands via sys.argv, which is inherent to such scripts but not malicious per se. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature."
