  "purpose": "This script initializes a Django application by setting the environment variable and executing command-line management commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variable setting via os.environ.setdefault, importing execute_from_command_line, sys.argv",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line with sys.argv (potentially executing arbitrary commands)",
  "flows": "sys.argv (user input) -> execute_from_command_line (executes commands based on input)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard environment setup and execution pattern",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings, then imports and runs Django management commands based on command-line input. The use of sys.argv allows execution of any management command, which is standard in Django scripts. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The script appears to be a typical entry point for Django CLI operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django management script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely delegates command execution based on user input. No malicious behavior or sabotage observed.",
