  "purpose": "The script initializes a Django management command environment and executes commands based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and sets an environment variable for Django settings.",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line executes commands that may include user input; environment variable setup influences Django behavior.",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> execute_from_command_line; environment variable setting influences Django execution context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard Django bootstrap process.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings, then invokes Django's management command execution with provided CLI arguments. The use of environment setting and execution of commands is typical for Django apps. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code relies on external inputs (sys.argv), which is standard, and does not process or handle untrusted data in a harmful way. It simply serves as a launcher for Django commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django management script without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely initializes Django environment and executes commands. No malware or security risks identified.",
