  "purpose": "Initialize and execute Django management commands based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv, environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line, which executes management commands potentially influenced by sys.argv",
  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line → management command execution",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward Django bootstrap pattern",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings, imports the execution function, and runs it with command-line arguments. It is a standard pattern for Django's manage.py. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary consideration is that passing sys.argv directly could allow execution of arbitrary commands if inputs are untrusted, but this is typical for Django management scripts and depends on deployment context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Django bootstrap file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The potential security concern is the execution of arbitrary commands via sys.argv, which is inherent to such scripts but not malicious per se. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
