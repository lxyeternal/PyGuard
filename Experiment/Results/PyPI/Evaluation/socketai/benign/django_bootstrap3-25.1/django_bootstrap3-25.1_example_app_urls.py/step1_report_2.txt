  "purpose": "Defines URL routing for a Django web application by mapping URL paths to their respective view classes.",
  "sources": "The URL patterns and the imported view classes from the views module.",
  "sinks": "The Django URL dispatcher executing the views, which may process untrusted input if the views are improperly implemented.",
  "flows": "URL requests to specific paths invoke corresponding class-based views; these views may handle user input data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is standard Django URL configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django URL routing setup, importing view classes and associating URL paths with views. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious code execution. It relies on standard Django patterns, with no dynamic code execution or insecure patterns visible. Since the code only maps URLs to views and imports views, and no other logic or data handling is present, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django URL configuration with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It merely maps URLs to views and does not process or handle untrusted data directly.",
