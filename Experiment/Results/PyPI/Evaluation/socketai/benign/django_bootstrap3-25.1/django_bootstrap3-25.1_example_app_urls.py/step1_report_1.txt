  "sources": "URL patterns and imported view classes.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of view methods (as_view()), which handle incoming HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "URL pattern matches -> calls corresponding view's as_view() method -> processes request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly sets up URL routes for various views within a Django application, with no user input handling or dynamic code execution present. It imports view classes and associates URL paths with their view handlers, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No external data sources, environment variables, or code injections are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django URL configuration module with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
