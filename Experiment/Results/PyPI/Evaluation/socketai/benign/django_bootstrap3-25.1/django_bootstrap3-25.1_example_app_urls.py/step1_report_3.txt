  "purpose": "Define URL routing for a Django web application by mapping URL paths to class-based views.",
  "sources": "The URL patterns list, which specifies URL paths and associated views.",
  "sinks": "The URL dispatcher invokes view methods, potentially handling user input, but no direct untrusted data sources are shown in this code.",
  "flows": "HTTP requests to specific URL paths are routed to corresponding view classes; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL patterns, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is straightforward URL routing.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet solely sets up URL patterns mapping static URL paths to imported view classes. It does not process user input directly, nor does it include any dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions. All views are imported, and their implementations are not shown, so any malicious activity would be within those views, not this routing configuration. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present in this module.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard Django URL routing code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as expected for URL configuration without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
