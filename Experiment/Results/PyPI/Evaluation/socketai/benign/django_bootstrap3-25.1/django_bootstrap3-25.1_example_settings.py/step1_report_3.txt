  "purpose": "Django application settings configuration for a web project.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, file paths, and configuration data for database, static/media files, and secret keys.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily sets configuration variables without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static assignment and configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; sensitive information such as SECRET_KEY is hardcoded but common in development settings. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module with configurations for database, static/media files, middleware, installed apps, logging, and templates. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is acceptable for development but insecure for production. The code does not include any network communication, external calls, or obfuscated segments. Overall, it appears to be a typical, benign configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Django settings file with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is suitable for development purposes, but sensitive secrets should be managed securely in production. No anomalies or suspicious activity detected.",
