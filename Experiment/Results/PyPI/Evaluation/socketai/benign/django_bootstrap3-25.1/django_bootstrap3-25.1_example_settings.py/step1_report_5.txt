  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django web application, including database setup, middleware, installed apps, and static/media file handling.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.join, and hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct data leaks, external data transmission, or sensitive data handling beyond standard configuration.",
  "flows": "No malicious source-to-sink data flow detected; configuration variables are used internally for setup without external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded SECRET_KEY, DEBUG set to True, and empty MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL values which could lead to misconfigurations if deployed in production. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module with typical configurations for database, middleware, templates, static/media files, and logging. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is a security concern in production but not malicious. DEBUG mode is enabled, which could expose sensitive information if not disabled in production. No use of untrusted inputs, external data, or suspicious logic detected. No malware or obfuscated code present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign configuration with some insecure defaults that should be corrected before deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings file with no malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. Security issues like hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG mode are present but do not indicate malicious intent. The configuration is typical for development environments; ensure to update these settings for production. Overall, no malicious activity detected.",
