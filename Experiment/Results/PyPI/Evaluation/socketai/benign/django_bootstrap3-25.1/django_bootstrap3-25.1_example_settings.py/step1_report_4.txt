  "purpose": "Configuration settings for a Django web application, including database setup, middleware, templates, static/media files, and security keys.",
  "sources": "Reading environment and configuration variables (e.g., SECRET_KEY), importing os module for path handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of SECRET_KEY, database credentials (if hardcoded or insecurely stored), or other sensitive configuration data.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables are set at import time; SECRET_KEY is hardcoded and static; no user input or external data sources are directly used.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, backdoors, or malicious code detected. SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is a security concern, but not malicious per se. No network connections, data leaks, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings file with standard configurations. No code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which can be a security vulnerability but does not indicate malicious intent. Static files and database configurations are standard. No suspicious or malicious logic is observed. The use of environment variables is absent, which could improve security, but this alone does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django project configuration file with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The main security concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY, which should be managed securely via environment variables. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
