  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard Django settings file with no malicious behavior. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is a security concern but not malicious. No suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score reflects that this is typical configuration code with a security concern about SECRET_KEY. The malware score is appropriately zero; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on DEBUG=True and empty MEDIA_ROOT/URL. No external inputs or malicious behavior. The security risk is slightly higher due to insecure defaults.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3\n\n- **Justification:** The increased risk score accounts for insecure configuration defaults, but no malware or obfuscation present.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical Django settings file. No untrusted data processing, no malicious code. SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, acceptable for development.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Justification:** Very low risk; only a minor concern about SECRET_KEY management.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, standard configuration, no malicious behavior. The concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk due to insecure defaults, but no malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard Django settings, insecure defaults (SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True), but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The security risk is justified; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.3) are justified based on insecure defaults (hardcoded secrets, DEBUG=True). These are configuration issues, not malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** Approximately 0.2, considering insecure defaults but no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No evidence of supply chain malware or malicious behavior. The primary concern is insecure configuration, which is common in development settings but should be addressed before production deployment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (average of the reports' scores)",
