  "purpose": "Standard Django settings configuration file for a web application.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters such as SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, DATABASES, ALLOWED_HOSTS, and static/media paths.",
  "sinks": "None; configuration parameters are set but do not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of configuration values; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True, empty MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL, insecure default database, and development settings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings module with no malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the hardcoded SECRET_KEY and DEBUG=True, which are acceptable in development but insecure for production. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The configuration issues are common in development environments and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of supply chain malware or malicious behavior. The security concerns relate to deployment practices rather than malicious code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting insecure defaults but no active threats.",
