{
  "purpose": "This code is a Django project settings configuration for a web application.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., __file__), static and media directory paths, SECRET_KEY, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive settings like SECRET_KEY, database path, allowed hosts, and media/static URLs that could expose sensitive info if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "No direct data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets static configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which is not best practice but not inherently malicious. No suspicious dynamic code execution, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials or secrets besides SECRET_KEY. No obfuscated code or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django settings file. It statically defines configuration options, including database location, security keys, middleware, installed apps, and logging. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware behavior. The SECRET_KEY being hardcoded is a security concern but not malicious. The code does not contain user input processing, external data sources, or network communications that could be exploited. Overall, the code is standard configuration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It includes sensitive configuration data, notably the SECRET_KEY, which should ideally be set via environment variables to improve security. No malware or supply chain attacks are present.",
