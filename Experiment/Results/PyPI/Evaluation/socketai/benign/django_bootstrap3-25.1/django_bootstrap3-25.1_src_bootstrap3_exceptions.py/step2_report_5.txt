  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports describe the code as defining two simple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. This matches the provided code.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' reasoning.**  \n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for exception handling.  \n- They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- No discrepancies or overlooked issues are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- **Malware score:** All assign 0, which is correct as there is no malicious activity.  \n- **SecurityRisk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any high risk scores (>0.5).**  \n- No report assigns a risk score above 0.0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Step 5: Check for any assumptions about vulnerabilities.**  \n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately identify the code as simple class definitions with no security implications.\n\n**Step 6: Confirm consistency of scores with the analysis.**  \n- The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning: all are 0s for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is purely for defining custom exceptions, with no security concerns.\n\n**However, for completeness, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nsince the code is standard, simple, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No changes needed. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
