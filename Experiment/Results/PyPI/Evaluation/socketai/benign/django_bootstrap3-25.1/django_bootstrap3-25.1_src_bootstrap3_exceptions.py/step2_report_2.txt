  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines two simple exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No logical errors or misjudgments are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct given the benign nature.\n   - If any report had assigned a higher risk, that would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly assign malware scores as 0, since there's no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious operations, dynamic code execution, or contain hardcoded secrets.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions solely on the code structure.\n   - No claims about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks present.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a textbook example of defining custom exceptions in Python.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and standard.\n\n**Summary**: All reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. The code poses no security concerns.",
