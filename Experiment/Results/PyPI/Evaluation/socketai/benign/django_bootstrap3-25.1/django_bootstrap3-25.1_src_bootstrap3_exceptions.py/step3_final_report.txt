  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the package.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward class declarations without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is simple, clear, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception with only docstrings. No data input/output, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is standard for error categorization, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, standard for defining custom exceptions, and poses no security risks. The reports accurately assess this, and their scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
