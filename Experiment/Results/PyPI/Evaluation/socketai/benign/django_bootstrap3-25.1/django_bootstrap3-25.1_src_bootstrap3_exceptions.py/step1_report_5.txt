  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as there are only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs detected. The code consists solely of standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from the base Exception class. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Python practices for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only establishing custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
