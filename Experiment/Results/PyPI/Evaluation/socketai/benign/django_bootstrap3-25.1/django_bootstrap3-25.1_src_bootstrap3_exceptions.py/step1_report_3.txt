  "flows": "No data flow or data movement observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. They are simple custom exception classes with docstrings. There is no dynamic execution, input handling, or data manipulation. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions in Python packages. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting only of standard custom exception class definitions. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
