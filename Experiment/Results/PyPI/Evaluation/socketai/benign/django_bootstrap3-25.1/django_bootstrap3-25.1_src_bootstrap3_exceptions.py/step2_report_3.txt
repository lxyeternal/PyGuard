  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:\n   - The code defines two classes: `BootstrapException` and `BootstrapError`, both inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - No input/output, data flow, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior is present.\n   - The classes are simple, with only docstrings explaining their purpose.\n\n2. **Issue Presence**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is solely for defining custom exception classes.\n   - No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and aligns with standard Python practices.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that there are no security risks, malware, or anomalies.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is appropriate.\n   - `obfuscated` = 0, correct given the code.\n   - `securityRisk` = 0, aligns with the benign nature.\n   - `confidence` = 1, justified by the straightforward analysis.\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - Malware score is correctly at 0; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly scored as 0.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code.\n   - They do not overstate the security implications.\n\n7. **Overall Consistency**:\n   - The scores and conclusions are consistent with the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (benign, standard exception class definitions)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is entirely benign, standard for Python exception handling, with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
