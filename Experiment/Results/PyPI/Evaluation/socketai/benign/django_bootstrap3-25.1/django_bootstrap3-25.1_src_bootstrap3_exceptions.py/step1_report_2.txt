  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a package.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources read by the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The classes are used to categorize exceptions related to a package, with no additional logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The simplicity indicates purpose for structured error handling rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and benign pattern for custom exception handling in Python. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
