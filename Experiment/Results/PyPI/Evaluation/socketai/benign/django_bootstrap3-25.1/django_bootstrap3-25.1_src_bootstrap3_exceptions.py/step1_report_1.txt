  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a package.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definitions with no unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It includes docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations. The structure appears straightforward and conventional for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining custom exception types without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard and safe.",
