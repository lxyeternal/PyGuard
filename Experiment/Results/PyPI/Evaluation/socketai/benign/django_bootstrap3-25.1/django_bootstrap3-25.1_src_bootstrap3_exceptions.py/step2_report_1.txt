  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines two classes: `BootstrapException` and `BootstrapError`, both inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - The classes contain only docstrings and no additional logic, data handling, or dynamic features.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Issue Presence & Security Concerns**:\n   - No input/output, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns.\n   - The code's purpose is purely for error categorization within a package.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - They assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Confidence levels are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, which makes sense given the simplicity and clarity.\n   - The risk scores are 0, as there's no indication of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Scores?**\n   - Since the code is purely for defining exception classes with no malicious or risky features, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - Any claims suggesting otherwise would be unfounded.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code is benign, with no security issues.\n   - The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- I agree with the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
