  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a package",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, no unusual or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. These classes are intended to categorize exceptions related to the package. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors observed. The classes are simple and serve standard error handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
