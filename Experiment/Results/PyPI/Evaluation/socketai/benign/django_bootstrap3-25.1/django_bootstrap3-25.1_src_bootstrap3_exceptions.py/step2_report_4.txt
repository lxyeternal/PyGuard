  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines two classes: `BootstrapException` and `BootstrapError`.\n   - Both inherit from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - They contain only docstrings and class definitions.\n   - No data input/output, dynamic code, or other suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Issue Presence & Security Concerns:**\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident.\n   - The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are present.\n   - The report correctly identifies that this is benign, straightforward code.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risk exists here.\n\n5. **Potential Overestimation or Underestimation:**\n   - The reports uniformly assign maximum confidence (1.0) and low scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, these scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; the analysis correctly states that the code is for error handling and poses no threat.\n\n7. **Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The conclusions align with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall,** the code is purely for defining custom exceptions with no security implications. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0               |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's simplicity.",
