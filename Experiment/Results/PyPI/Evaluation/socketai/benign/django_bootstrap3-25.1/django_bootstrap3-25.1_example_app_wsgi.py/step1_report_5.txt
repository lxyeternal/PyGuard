  "purpose": "Configure the WSGI application for a Django project to be used by servers and deployment environments.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', imported module 'django.core.wsgi', and commented middleware code.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is directly used in a risky manner or leads to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' influences the configuration of 'get_wsgi_application', which is used to serve the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The commented middleware section suggests possible extension but is harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings, imports the WSGI application, and exposes it as 'application'. No untrusted data flows directly into sensitive sinks. The code is standard for Django deployments. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads present. The commented-out middleware does not affect current behavior. Overall, the code appears safe and typical for a WSGI configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django WSGI configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical setup for deploying Django applications, with no indications of malware or security issues.",
