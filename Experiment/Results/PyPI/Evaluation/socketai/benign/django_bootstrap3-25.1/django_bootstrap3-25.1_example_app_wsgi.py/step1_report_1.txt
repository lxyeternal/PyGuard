{
  "purpose": "Configure and expose the WSGI application for a Django project to enable deployment via WSGI servers.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', import of 'os' module, call to 'get_wsgi_application()'",
  "sinks": "Environment variable access, application object creation",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE' is set at startup, then used by Django to load settings; application object is created from Django's WSGI handler",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no external network calls, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a standard WSGI configuration for a Django project. It sets a default environment variable for Django settings, imports the necessary Django WSGI application function, and creates the application object. The comments suggest best practices and potential extensions like middleware. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It follows standard deployment patterns without hardcoded credentials or insecure code. The environment variable setting is conventional and safe, and no external data flows are evident beyond environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign Django WSGI configuration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard deployment practices without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
