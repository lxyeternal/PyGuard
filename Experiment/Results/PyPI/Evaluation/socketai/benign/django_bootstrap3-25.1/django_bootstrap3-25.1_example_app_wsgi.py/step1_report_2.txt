  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious environment manipulation",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django WSGI configuration script. It sets an environment variable for Django settings, then retrieves the WSGI application object. The comments suggest standard usage and potential for middleware extension. No data leaks, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code is typical and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django WSGI setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for configuring the WSGI application in a secure and conventional manner.",
