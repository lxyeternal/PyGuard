  "purpose": "Configure the WSGI application for a Django project, enabling deployment via WSGI servers.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE), importing get_wsgi_application() from django.core.wsgi.",
  "sinks": "get_wsgi_application() initializes the WSGI application; environment variable setting influences configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting influences Django configuration used by get_wsgi_application().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard WSGI setup with commented placeholder for middleware.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django WSGI application, deferring to environment variables for configuration. It imports necessary modules, sets a default environment variable, and exposes the application object. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The commented middleware section is benign placeholder code. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, safe deployment configuration for Django, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Django WSGI configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly sets up the application for deployment without introducing any malicious code.",
