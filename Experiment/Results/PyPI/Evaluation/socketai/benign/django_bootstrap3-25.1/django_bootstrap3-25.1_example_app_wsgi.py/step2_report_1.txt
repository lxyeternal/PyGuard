  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard Django WSGI configuration script.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- Environment variables are used in a conventional manner.\n- No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or backdoors are indicated.\n- The code is consistent with typical deployment patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Configure and expose WSGI app.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar standard setup.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity, safe configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Standard, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious code; the only deviation is a `securityRisk` score of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Justification for securityRisk=0.1:**  \nThe code is very standard, and the only \"risk\" could be the environment variable setting, which is common. Since there's no actual vulnerability or malicious activity, a small risk score (0.1) might be acceptable, perhaps indicating a minimal configuration risk. However, unless there's a specific concern (e.g., environment variable misconfiguration), this seems unwarranted.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- **Security risk should be 0** unless there's an explicit concern about environment variable handling, which is standard here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:**  \n  - Most reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - Report 4 assigns 0.1, which seems unnecessary given the benign code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The small security risk in report 4 is unwarranted; it should be revised to 0.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores overall should be **0** for all reports, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 across all reports (except report 4, which should be revised from 0.1 to 0).\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard, safe Django WSGI configuration.",
