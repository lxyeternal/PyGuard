  "sources": "os.environ.setdefault, get_wsgi_application()",
  "sinks": "get_wsgi_application()",
  "flows": "os.environ.setdefault sets environment variable; get_wsgi_application initializes WSGI app based on environment variable",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no backdoors, no suspicious imports or runtime behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code primarily configures the environment for a Django application to run via WSGI. It sets a default environment variable for Django settings and imports the standard WSGI application. The code contains only standard Django deployment setup, with no external network calls, no code injection, or obfuscated logic. The commented-out middleware is benign and typical in Django projects. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django WSGI configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
