  "flows": "Environment variable setting influences the configuration, which is used by the application object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, straightforward Django WSGI setup. It sets a default environment variable, imports the WSGI application factory, and exposes the application object. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. Comments indicate potential middleware extension, but this is benign. The environment variable setting is standard and safe. No external network calls or code obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django WSGI configuration script with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate a safe deployment setup.",
