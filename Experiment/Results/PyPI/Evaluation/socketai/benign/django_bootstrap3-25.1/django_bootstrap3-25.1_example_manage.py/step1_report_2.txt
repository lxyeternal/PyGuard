  "purpose": "Set the default Django settings module and run Django management commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variable setting with os.environ.setdefault and command-line arguments with sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line, which executes management commands based on sys.argv.",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs influence the behavior of execute_from_command_line; environment variable influences Django configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django settings, then imports and runs Django's management command interface using command-line arguments. This is standard Django practice. No untrusted data flows, no suspicious logic, no embedded secrets, or malicious commands are evident. The code appears straightforward and intended for typical Django project management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django management script to run commands based on provided arguments. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware detected.",
