  "purpose": "Set the Django settings module environment variable and run Django management commands",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and sets environment variable (os.environ)",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line uses sys.argv to perform management tasks, which can include executing arbitrary commands",
  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line; environment variable setting influences Django behavior",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed; code is minimal and standard for Django CLI entry point",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default environment variable for Django, then invokes Django's command-line utility with arguments. No suspicious or malicious code is present. The only potential concern is if sys.argv is manipulated externally, but that is typical for CLI apps and not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward and standard for Django project entry points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django CLI bootstrap script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets an environment variable and runs management commands.",
