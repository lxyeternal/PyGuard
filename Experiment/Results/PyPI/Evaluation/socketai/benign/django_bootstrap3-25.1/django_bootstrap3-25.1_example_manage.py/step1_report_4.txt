  "purpose": "This script sets up the environment and executes a Django management command.",
  "sources": "Environment variable setting (os.environ.setdefault), command-line arguments (sys.argv)",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line (executes the command line arguments as Django commands)",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> execute_from_command_line; os.environ -> configuration for Django environment",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.environ.setdefault to set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is typical for Django apps; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code detected; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes the Django environment by setting DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE if not already set, then calls Django's command-line utility with the provided arguments. The code follows standard Django startup patterns with no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. The code only sets an environment variable and runs a management command, both of which are typical operations for a Django project entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard Django application startup routine without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code appears benign and typical for Django management scripts.",
