  "purpose": "To initialize and run a Django management command based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "os.environ.setdefault and sys.argv",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line processing sys.argv",
  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line → potential execution of commands",
  "anomalies": "Use of setdefault for environment variable; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The script sets a default Django settings module, then invokes Django's command-line utility with provided arguments. It does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or execute untrusted code beyond the expected Django management commands. No malicious behavior or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and typical for Django project entry points.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard Django management script, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares environment and runs commands, and does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies.",
