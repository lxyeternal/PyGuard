  "purpose": "Load project metadata from a local 'pyproject.toml' file and set up documentation configuration variables.",
  "sources": "Reading '../pyproject.toml' file, extracting 'project' name, version, authors.",
  "sinks": "Assigning extracted data to configuration variables; no untrusted data sinks or external commands.",
  "flows": "File read -> parse -> assign variables for documentation setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data extraction with standard libraries; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local configuration file using standard libraries, extracts project metadata, and sets variables for documentation purposes. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input beyond reading a local file. The data flow is simple and transparent. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the straightforward and safe behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
