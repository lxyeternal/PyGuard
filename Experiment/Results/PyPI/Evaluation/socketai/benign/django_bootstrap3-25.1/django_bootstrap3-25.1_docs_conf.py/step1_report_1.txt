  "purpose": "Load and process project metadata from a TOML configuration file to set up documentation build parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading the '../pyproject.toml' file and parsing its contents using tomllib.load.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the TOML file and used to define variables for documentation configuration; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; usage of standard libraries and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code loads project metadata from a TOML file, extracting project name, version, authors, and current year to define variables for documentation. It uses standard library 'tomllib' for parsing and 'datetime' for current year. The variables are then used for setting documentation parameters such as extensions, HTML theme, and filenames. All operations are typical for documentation setup scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard configuration setup for documentation purposes, securely reading project metadata without any malicious code or security risks.",
