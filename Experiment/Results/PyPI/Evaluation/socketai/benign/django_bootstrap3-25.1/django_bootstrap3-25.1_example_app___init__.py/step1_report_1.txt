  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific functionality in a Python package, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly from external modules or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into system calls, network connections, or file writes, though specific sinks are not explicitly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data from input or environment sources flows through processing functions and may reach output or system interaction points such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are apparent. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are evident. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and uses standard Python functions and library calls. No malicious or suspicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity are present. There are no signs of obfuscation or unusual code constructs. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and designed for typical application logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose without involving suspicious or harmful actions.",
