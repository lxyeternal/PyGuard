  },
  "justification": "Based on the review of all reports, the highest suspicion arises from reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic code execution, notably Reports 2 and 3. Adjusted malware scores upward to reflect the presence of eval/exec and obfuscation, which are significant indicators of potential malicious intent. Obfuscation scores are maintained high where described, and security risk is set moderate to account for the potential threat without confirmed malicious activity. The overall assessment balances the evidence, emphasizing cautious interpretation of obfuscation and dynamic features.",
  "recommendations": "Further dynamic analysis is advised for reports with high obfuscation and dynamic code features to confirm malicious activity. Static scores are adjusted to better reflect the potential risks identified.",
