{
  "purpose": "Defines various Django forms for input validation and rendering, including file uploads, contact info, and testing forms.",
  "sources": "Input fields such as EmailField, CharField, URLField, FileField, and ImageField; data from form submissions and user input.",
  "sinks": "Form validation errors, data storage, and potentially rendering HTML with help_text; no direct data leakage or insecure output identified.",
  "flows": "User inputs are received through form fields and processed in clean() methods, but no untrusted data is propagated to external sinks or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "All clean() methods intentionally raise validation errors for demonstration; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. Use of non-ASCII labels and help_text is benign. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard Django form definitions, with no external data fetching, network communication, or execution of untrusted code. The only notable behaviors are the intentional raising of ValidationError in clean() methods for UI demonstration purposes. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or insecure handling of data, are present. Third-party library usage is standard, and no dangerous code constructs are used.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of Django form definitions used for testing and user input validation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. All suspicious or malicious signals are absent.",
