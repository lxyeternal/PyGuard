{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django form classes primarily for testing, demonstration, or data collection purposes, with intentional validation errors for UI styling.",
  "sources": "Input fields such as EmailField, CharField, FileField, URLField, and choices; data is read from form submissions and initial values.",
  "sinks": "ValidationError raised in clean() methods; no data sinks or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from form inputs to validation logic; validation errors are intentionally triggered in clean() methods, affecting form rendering but not maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional raising of ValidationError in multiple clean() methods; use of initial=42 in CharField; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Django form classes with standard fields and intentionally triggered validation errors for testing UI error styling. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The raising of ValidationError unconditionally is a testing artifact, not malicious. Use of initial=42 is unconventional but benign. No suspicious data handling or security flaws are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily for testing and demonstration purposes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of approximately 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's intent.",
