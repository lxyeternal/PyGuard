  "purpose": "Implement custom hyperparameter searchers for Ray Tune, supporting list-based configurations for sequential and randomized search strategies.",
  "sources": "Input parameter grid or list of dictionaries for configurations; sampling from distributions or lists within the configurations.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or data leaks; configurations are generated internally without external influence.",
  "flows": "Input parameter grid or list -> configuration generation -> suggestion of configurations for trials.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two subclasses of Ray Tune's Searcher: ListSearcher, which sequentially suggests configurations from a list generated via sklearn's ParameterGrid; and RandomListSearcher, which randomly samples configurations and parameter values from lists or distributions. Both use standard libraries and methods, with no external data access or network activity. Use of random.randint without seed impacts reproducibility but not security. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with its purpose, with minimal security concerns primarily related to reproducibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate, and intended for hyperparameter tuning. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, mainly reflecting minor reproducibility considerations. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments.",
