  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate, and intended for hyperparameter tuning. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate, mainly reflecting minor reproducibility considerations. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments."
