{
  "purpose": "Define custom searcher classes for hyperparameter tuning with support for list-based parameter configurations, intended to be used with Ray Tune.",
  "sources": "Input source is the parameter_grid provided to the constructors of ListSearcher and RandomListSearcher.",
  "sinks": "Generated hyperparameter configurations returned by suggest methods; no direct data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameter_grid -> suggest() methods -> output configurations; no external data flows or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of random number generator appears appropriate for search purposes; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom searcher classes inheriting from Ray's Searcher. ListSearcher iterates over a list of parameter configurations, providing them sequentially. RandomListSearcher selects random configurations from a list, generating hyperparameters, including sampling from distributions or lists. The code uses standard Python modules and Ray's API without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external data transmission, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. No obfuscated code or hidden logic. The use of random functions is consistent with hyperparameter search and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements legitimate custom search algorithms for hyperparameter tuning, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for optimizing models with specified parameter grids.",
