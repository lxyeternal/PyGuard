  "purpose": "A cross-validation hyperparameter search class leveraging Ray Tune with early stopping, multi-metric evaluation, and resource management.",
  "sources": "Input datasets (X, y, groups), environment variables for resource configuration, user-defined configs, and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "No malicious sinks; data flows through standard ML pipelines, with results stored in cv_results_.",
  "flows": "Data from inputs (X, y, configs, environment variables) into training and evaluation routines, with results formatted into cv_results_.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network or file activity, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of a hyperparameter tuning framework using scikit-learn and Ray Tune. It manages configurations, resource allocation, early stopping, and result formatting securely. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Usage of environment variables for resource management is typical in distributed ML workflows. The code employs standard libraries and patterns, with no suspicious data leaks or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a hyperparameter search utility. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified, primarily due to reliance on environment variables for resource configuration, which is common practice. Overall, the code is safe for deployment and further use.",
