  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a hyperparameter search utility. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified, primarily due to reliance on environment variables for resource configuration, which is common practice. Overall, the code is safe for deployment and further use."
