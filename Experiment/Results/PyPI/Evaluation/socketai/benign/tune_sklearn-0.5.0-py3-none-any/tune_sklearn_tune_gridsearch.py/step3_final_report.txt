  "purpose": "A class implementing hyperparameter tuning via Ray Tune, integrating with scikit-learn estimators for distributed grid search with optional early stopping and logging.",
  "sources": "Input hyperparameter grid, datasets (X, y), estimator, and configuration parameters for tune.run",
  "sinks": "tune.run execution, estimator.fit calls, configuration dictionaries, and logging callbacks",
  "flows": "Data from param_grid and datasets flow into tune configurations and estimator training within tune.run",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for distributed hyperparameter search using Ray Tune and scikit-learn. It employs common APIs, manages configurations securely, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The data flows are typical for such workflows, with no external network activity or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard hyperparameter tuning utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
