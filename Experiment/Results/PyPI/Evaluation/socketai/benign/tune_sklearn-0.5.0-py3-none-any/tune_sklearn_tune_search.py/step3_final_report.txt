{
  "purpose": "This code implements a hyperparameter tuning framework using Ray Tune, supporting multiple search algorithms and validation strategies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'X', 'y', 'param_distributions', and external libraries for search spaces and optimization algorithms.",
  "sinks": "Configuration dictionaries and 'tune.run' execution, which orchestrate the hyperparameter search process.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and configurations into search algorithms and ultimately into 'tune.run' for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected; dynamic imports and dependency checks are standard for optional external libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured hyperparameter tuning utility that performs validation, manages external dependencies, and executes distributed search. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or covert activities are present. External dependencies are used as intended, and no obfuscation or malicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate implementation of a hyperparameter search framework. No malicious or obfuscated elements are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to external dependencies but no malicious intent.",
