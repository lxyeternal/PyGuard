{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check for the presence of specific machine learning libraries (xgboost, lightgbm, catboost) and whether a given classifier instance belongs to these models.",
  "sources": "Import statements within functions that check for library presence and model type (e.g., 'import xgboost', 'import lightgbm', 'from catboost import CatBoost').",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "The functions check for library existence and version, then verify class instances. Data flows from imported modules to class type checks, with no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code uses standard import and isinstance checks without dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for library detection and class type verification. It uses try-except blocks to detect the presence of optional dependencies and checks for specific class instances. There are no signs of malicious activities, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is clean, readable, and uses standard patterns for optional dependency management and type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely utility-based with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It facilitates model type checking for machine learning frameworks and performs no actions that pose security threats.",
