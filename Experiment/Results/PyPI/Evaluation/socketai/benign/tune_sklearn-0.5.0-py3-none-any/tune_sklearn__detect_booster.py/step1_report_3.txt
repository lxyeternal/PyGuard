{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to detect the presence and types of specific machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) in a Python environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements within functions that load model libraries and version information, notably 'import xgboost', 'import lightgbm', 'import catboost', and accessing 'lightgbm.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems. No data leaks, network operations, or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "The functions import ML libraries and check class instances. These are static checks and do not involve data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The import checks and version parsing are standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import attempts and type checks to identify if certain ML models are loaded or used. It handles ImportError exceptions gracefully. Version checking is performed via parsing __version__. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious logic observed. The structure is straightforward and adheres to common patterns for optional dependency detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for detecting specific ML libraries and models. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The functions are standard and serve an informational purpose without security implications.",
