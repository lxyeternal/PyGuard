{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check the availability and types of specific machine learning models from libraries like xgboost, lightgbm, and catboost.",
  "sources": "The code reads module import statements and version information from third-party libraries (xgboost, lightgbm, catboost).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or data; the code primarily checks library presence and types.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves checking import success (source) and then verifying if a classifier instance matches specific model classes (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no suspicious or unusual behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The functions primarily perform safe import checks and instance type checks for well-known ML libraries. Version checking for lightgbm is also performed. The code handles exceptions gracefully and uses standard practices. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. The structure is clear, and no potentially dangerous operations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for verifying library presence, versions, and model types. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risks and appears to be intended for use in a larger ML application for model validation.",
