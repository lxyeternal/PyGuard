  "purpose": "Utility functions to detect presence and versions of ML libraries (xgboost, lightgbm, catboost) and verify if classifiers are instances of specific models.",
  "sources": "Import statements within functions, version attribute of lightgbm, classifier object passed as argument.",
  "sinks": "Type checks on classifier objects, import statements, version parsing (no external data or network activity).",
  "flows": "Import attempts -> version parsing -> isinstance checks on classifier objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe, standard library detection and type verification. It uses try-except for optional dependencies, parses version strings, and checks object types with isinstance(). No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The functions are simple, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or secrets. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility module for ML library detection and model type verification. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and accurate.",
