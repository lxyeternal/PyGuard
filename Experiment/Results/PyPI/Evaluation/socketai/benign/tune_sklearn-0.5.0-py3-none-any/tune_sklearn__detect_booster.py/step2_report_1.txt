  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as utility functions for detecting ML libraries and model types.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or sensitive data processing is involved.\n- The code uses standard patterns: try-except for optional dependencies, version parsing, and isinstance checks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- It is purely utility-based, performing library detection and type verification.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or data leaks are present.\n- The code handles optional dependencies safely and correctly.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- Since the code only imports modules and performs type checks, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n- No assumptions are made about the presence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate** after this review aligns with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard utility module with no malicious or security concerns. The reported scores are appropriate and justified.",
