  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Behavior or Code:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, consisting of import checks and type verifications for ML libraries and models.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code uses standard patterns for optional dependencies and safe type checking.\n- **Conclusion:** There is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**2. Code Validation:**\n- The code snippets match the descriptions in the reports.\n- Functions perform import attempts within try-except blocks, check for library versions, and verify model types with `isinstance()`.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n**3. Score Justification:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware: 0`\n  - `securityRisk: 0`\n  - `obfuscated: 0`\n  - `confidence: 1`\n- These are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious code is detected.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; the code performs no harmful operations.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and readable.\n\n**4. Potential for Higher Scores:**\n- Since the code is purely utility functions with no malicious intent, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n- The only caveat could be if the code were part of a supply chain attack, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**5. Final Assessment:**\n- Based on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n\n**6. My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign utility for detecting ML libraries and models. All evidence points to a safe, standard implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores are necessary. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
