  "purpose": "Utility functions to detect presence and types of machine learning models from popular libraries (xgboost, lightgbm, catboost).",
  "sources": "Import statements within functions, particularly in has_xgboost, has_lightgbm, has_required_lightgbm_version, is_xgboost_model, is_lightgbm_model, is_lightgbm_model_of_required_version, has_catboost, is_catboost_model.",
  "sinks": "None identified; data flow primarily involves importing modules and type-checking variables.",
  "flows": "Import modules (sources) and check object types (sinks); no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code uses dynamic imports conditioned on package availability, which is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to check for the presence of specific machine learning libraries and whether given classifiers are instances of models from these libraries. It performs conditional imports inside functions, which is common for optional dependencies. Version checking for lightgbm is correctly handled through parsing __version__, and type-checking is done via isinstance() after importing the relevant classes. No data is read from external sources, no untrusted input is processed, and no network or system modifications are attempted. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains benign utility functions for detecting and verifying ML model types from popular libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code's design is standard and safe.",
