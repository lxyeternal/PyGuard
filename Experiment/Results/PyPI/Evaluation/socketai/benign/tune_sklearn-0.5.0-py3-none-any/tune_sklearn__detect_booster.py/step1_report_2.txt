{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to detect the presence and type of specific machine learning libraries (xgboost, lightgbm, catboost) and check model types.",
  "sources": "Import statements within functions, particularly within try-except blocks and conditional checks for library versions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports modules and checks types, with no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking for library existence, then importing and verifying model instances; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and mainly consists of conditional imports and type checks for well-known ML libraries. It handles ImportError exceptions properly, avoiding unnecessary crashes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The functions do not perform any network communication, system modifications, or suspicious operations. All library imports are within functions and are standard for ML detection scripts. Version checking is also standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for checking the presence and type of specific ML libraries and models. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger ML-related project.",
