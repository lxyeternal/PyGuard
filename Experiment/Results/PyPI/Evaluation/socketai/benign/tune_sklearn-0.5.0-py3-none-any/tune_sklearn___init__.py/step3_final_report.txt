{
  "purpose": "To re-export specific classes and version information from the 'tune_sklearn' package for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tune_sklearn' modules and the '__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Static import of classes and version info; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and version info from an external package and defines '__all__' for public API exposure. It is syntactically correct, simple, and adheres to standard Python practices. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export setup with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
