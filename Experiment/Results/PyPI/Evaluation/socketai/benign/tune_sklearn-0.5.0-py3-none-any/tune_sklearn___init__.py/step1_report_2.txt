{
  "purpose": "The code defines what symbols are exported from the module, likely serving as an entry point or interface for a package related to hyperparameter tuning in scikit-learn.",
  "sources": "Import statements for specific classes and variables from external modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks; the code only imports and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply re-exports imported components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The version import is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three entities: two classes (TuneGridSearchCV and TuneSearchCV) and a version string. It then defines __all__ for module exports. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows common Python packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module interface definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It merely re-exports classes and a version string for external use.",
