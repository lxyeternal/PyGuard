{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes and variables from a package called 'tune_sklearn' and defines the publicly accessible API of the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tune_sklearn' modules and the version attribute.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code simply re-exports imported components.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, importing and exposing components.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and version info from a third-party package, then defines the module's __all__ for public API exposure. There is no data input, no processing, and no external communications. The code appears standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module wrapper exposing parts of the 'tune_sklearn' package. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
