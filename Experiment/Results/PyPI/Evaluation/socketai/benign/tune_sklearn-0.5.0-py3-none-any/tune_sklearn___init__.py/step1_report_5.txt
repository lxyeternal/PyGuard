{
  "purpose": "The code exports specific classes and variables related to tuning machine learning models, likely to be used in a larger application for hyperparameter optimization.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'tune_sklearn' package, specifically modules for grid search, search, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; the code only defines what is exported.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process untrusted data or user input, nor does it contain runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script solely imports specific classes and a version variable from the 'tune_sklearn' package and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There are no data processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. The code is standard for a Python module preparing exports, with no suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module that re-exports components from an external library without any malicious intent or security issues. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
