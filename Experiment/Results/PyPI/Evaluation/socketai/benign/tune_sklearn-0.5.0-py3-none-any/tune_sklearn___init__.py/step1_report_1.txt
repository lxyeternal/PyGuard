{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for a package, specifying classes and version information to be publicly accessible.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'tune_sklearn' package modules: 'tune_gridsearch', 'tune_search', and '_version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing identified; no operations involve user input or external data handling.",
  "flows": "The imported modules and version info are assigned to __all__, establishing public API; no data flows leading to security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and version info from an external package and sets up the module's __all__ variable to define what is exported. It performs no computations, data processing, or network operations. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard Python module practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export declaration with no malicious behavior, no signs of obfuscation, and no security risks. It is standard in structure and purpose.",
