{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API of a module by importing specific classes and variables from submodules within the 'tune_sklearn' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes and variables from 'tune_sklearn.tune_gridsearch', 'tune_sklearn.tune_search', and 'tune_sklearn._version'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks related to untrusted data processing, execution, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only performs imports and sets the __all__ attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for defining module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and a version string from internal submodules and exposes them via __all__. There is no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or handling of untrusted input. It appears to be a typical module __init__.py pattern. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard module setup for exposing certain classes and variables. It contains no malicious code or security risks.",
