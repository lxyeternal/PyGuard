  "purpose": "Classes for training ML models with Ray Tune, supporting early stopping, checkpointing, and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Data from setup, cross-validation, and checkpoint files; no external network activity.",
  "sinks": "Model checkpoint files; no untrusted data flow or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into training routines; checkpoint files are saved/loaded locally; no network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard distributed ML training with checkpointing via ray.cloudpickle, early stopping, and cross-validation. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Serialization practices are typical for distributed workflows but should be used cautiously if deserializing untrusted data. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured ML training utility with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The use of pickle-based serialization is standard but warrants caution in untrusted environments. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal.",
