  "purpose": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a package version indicator.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the assignment is isolated and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward string assignment for versioning, with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. All reports confirm its benign nature, noting no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string declaration with no security risks or malicious behavior. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
