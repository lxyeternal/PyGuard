  "purpose": "Utility functions for early stopping, scoring, and logging in ML workflows using Ray Tune and scikit-learn.",
  "sources": "Configuration checks, attribute access, and import statements for ML utilities and logging setup.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network calls, or untrusted data handling; internal validation and setup only.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (configurations, class attributes) lead to validation, setup, and logger initialization without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no external network or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard utility functions for model validation, early stopping, and logging configuration. It imports well-known libraries, performs attribute checks, and sets up logging callbacks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or code injection. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent with benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for ML workflows with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The risk is very low, and the scores are appropriate.",
