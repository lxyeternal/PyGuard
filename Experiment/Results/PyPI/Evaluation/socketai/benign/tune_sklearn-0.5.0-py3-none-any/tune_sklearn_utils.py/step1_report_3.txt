{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for integrating machine learning model tuning with Ray Tune, including early stopping, scoring, and logging configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries, defines functions, and classes that do not process untrusted input directly; no explicit data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands; no data leaks or harmful actions observed.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining utility functions and classes to facilitate model tuning workflows, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard for machine learning workflows, with proper use of class checks, validation, and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for model validation, early stopping criteria, scoring checks, and logger configuration. It imports trusted libraries and performs standard operations such as type checking, validation, and conditional logic. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code does not execute any system commands, network requests, or handle untrusted data inputs. All imported libraries are publicly known and legitimate for machine learning workflows. The structure and functionality are consistent with typical open-source ML utility code, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for model tuning workflows with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It appears safe for use, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
