{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket server with static file serving capabilities, optional Flash policy server, and logging functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('PATH_INFO', 'HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH'), filesystem files for static content, and socket connections for WebSocket communication.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is used without validation, but currently filenames are derived from 'basename', limiting risk. No other untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and URL paths flows into file serving or WebSocket handling; filesystem reads provide static content; socket connections manage WebSocket data; exception handling covers error flows.",
  "anomalies": "Broad 'except:' clauses mask specific errors, which could hide bugs but are common in server code; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation detected; file serving based on URL path without explicit validation could pose directory traversal risks if not sanitized elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard WebSocket server with static file support and optional Flash policy server. It handles connections, serves files based on URL paths, manages WebSocket handshakes, and logs activities. Exception handling is broad, which could mask errors but does not indicate malicious intent. Files are served directly from the filesystem, and no suspicious code patterns or malicious payloads are present. External modules used are standard for such applications. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors like data exfiltration or backdoors are detected. The overall structure and behavior align with legitimate server code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical, benign WebSocket server with static file serving and policy support. No malicious or sabotage activities are evident. The low malware score (0), no obfuscation (0), and a low security risk score (0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
