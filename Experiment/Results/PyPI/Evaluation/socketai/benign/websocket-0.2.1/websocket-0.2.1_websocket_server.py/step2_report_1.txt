  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code implements a WebSocket server with static file serving, optional Flash policy server, and logging.\n- They note broad exception handling with 'except:' clauses, which can mask errors but is common in server code.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constants are identified.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, are evident.\n- The code relies on external modules (e.g., websocket, gevent), which are standard for such applications.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present in the code?**\n\n- The reports mainly focus on the structure, error handling, and potential security concerns.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code's logic matches the description: serving files, handling WebSocket connections, managing policy server, logging, and exception handling.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**\n\n- All reports correctly identify broad exception handling as a potential concern but do not consider it malicious.\n- They correctly note that no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.\n- They acknowledge that the code's behavior appears standard and safe.\n\n**3. Are the scores reasonable?**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.2 is assigned, indicating low risk, which seems appropriate given the code's functionality.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5?**\n\n- No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities justifies higher scores.\n- The low scores are appropriate.\n\n**5. Any claims based on assumptions?**\n\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on code analysis.\n- They recognize the broad exception handling but do not overstate its implications.\n\n**6. Consistency of scores with the report content?**\n\n- Yes, all scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate WebSocket server with static file serving and Flash policy support.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- Exception handling could be improved, but it does not indicate malicious intent.\n- The risk scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Scores:\n\n**Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk:** **0.2** — Low risk due to broad exception handling and standard server features, but no significant vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
