{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket server with support for serving files, handling WebSocket connections, and optional flash policy server integration.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables ('PATH_INFO', 'HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH'), the filesystem (via open(path).read()), and class attributes (self.environ, self.server.etags, self.socket, self.rfile).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to sys.stderr, sys.stderr.write, self.write() for HTTP responses, and log messages. Files are read from disk and served based on requests.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and filesystem flows into HTTP response handling, file serving, and WebSocket initialization. Data from requests influences server responses and WebSocket setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Use of 'except' without specific exception types can hide errors. The code logs exceptions, but this is standard. The code reads files and manages sockets normally. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides WebSocket server functionality, serving files, managing WebSocket connections, and optional policy server start-up. It reads environment variables for request info and filesystem for serving static files. Exception handling is broad, but this is typical for server code. No signs of malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code logs errors and manages sockets securely. No suspicious data flows or code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a WebSocket server with static file serving and policy server support. No malicious intent, malicious behaviors, or security risks are detected based on the provided code. The code does not contain suspicious or malicious payloads or behaviors.",
