{
  "purpose": "Implements a WebSocket server with file serving capabilities, policy server management, and logging.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'PATH_INFO', 'HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH'), files from disk (via open), and socket connections.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to sys.stderr, network sockets via self.socket, log files via self.log, and HTTP responses via start_response.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file inputs influence HTTP response logic; socket objects are used in WebSocket handling; logs are written during server start and error handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception handling with broad 'except' clauses, which can mask errors; file read operations without sanitization; traceback printing on errors; no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a WebSocket server with file serving and policy server management. It utilizes environment variables and file I/O but does not process untrusted input in a way that suggests malicious intent. Error handling is broad but typical for server code. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or network connections are present. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior is detected. The code mainly manages network communication, file responses, and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate server implementation for WebSocket and Flash policy serving purposes, with standard error handling and logging. No malware or security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
