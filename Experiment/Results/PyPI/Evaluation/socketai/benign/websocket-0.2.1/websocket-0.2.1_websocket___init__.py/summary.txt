  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, outdated WebSocket protocol implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security risks stem from protocol weaknesses and insecure hashing, but these do not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3)."
