  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No, the code appears to implement a standard WebSocket draft protocol (version 75/76). No obfuscation, suspicious variable names, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  Minor typo: 'self.websocket' used in one branch likely a typo or leftover from refactoring, but it doesn't impact security directly. Potential exception if headers are missing, but not a security flaw.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — accurate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — accurate.  \n  Risk: 0.2 — reasonable given the outdated protocol but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Justification for Risk Score**  \n  The code implements an outdated protocol draft, which can be insecure in modern contexts, but no active vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No malicious activity detected. The code supports an old WebSocket draft with known security weaknesses, such as lack of validation, use of MD5, and no encryption.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The report notes use of deprecated features, no validation, and weak hashing—these are protocol-level vulnerabilities, not malicious code.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0.4 — moderate, reflecting security vulnerabilities inherent in the protocol, not malicious intent.\n\n- **Justification for Risk**  \n  The code's security weaknesses stem from protocol obsolescence, not malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Similar to previous, supports an old draft with weak security practices, but no malicious code.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  Uses MD5, no validation, no encryption—these are vulnerabilities but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  Risk: 0.7 — high, due to insecure practices, but not malicious.\n\n- **Justification**  \n  The high risk score reflects insecure protocol handling, not malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Implements an older WebSocket draft, no malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  Similar issues with deprecated protocol, lack of validation, but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0.2 — low, reflecting protocol obsolescence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  No. Standard WebSocket server implementation, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  No significant flaws; some minor validation gaps, but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Scores?**  \n  Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** The primary concern is the use of deprecated WebSocket draft protocols, weak hashing (MD5), and lack of validation, which are security vulnerabilities but not malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code or payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Risk:** 0.3 — slightly higher than the reports' 0.2-0.4 due to the combination of outdated protocols, weak hashing, and lack of validation, which could be exploited in insecure environments but do not constitute active malware or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, albeit outdated, WebSocket protocol implementation. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The security risk is moderate due to protocol weaknesses but not malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Upgrade to modern WebSocket standards with secure hashing (SHA-256 or better).  \n- Implement input validation and validation of headers.  \n- Use secure transport (TLS).  \n- Avoid deprecated protocol versions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo malware, no obfuscation, but moderate security risks due to protocol obsolescence and weak cryptography.",
