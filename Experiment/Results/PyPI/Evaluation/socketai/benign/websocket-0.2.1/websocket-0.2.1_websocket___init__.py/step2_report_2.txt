  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Implements WebSocket handshake and messaging per an older draft. No obfuscation, no malicious payloads, no hardcoded secrets. Minor typo referencing `self.websocket` but no security impact.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward implementation with minimal security concerns. The low risk score aligns with the analysis. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Implements a deprecated WebSocket draft. Lacks input validation, uses MD5 for challenge response, no encryption, no authentication. Potential security vulnerabilities due to protocol obsolescence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4\n- **Assessment:** No malware or obfuscation, but the security risk is moderate due to outdated protocol and weak cryptography. The score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, outdated draft, insecure hashing, no validation, no encryption. No malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.7\n- **Assessment:** Higher risk score reflects the insecure practices. Still, no malware or obfuscation. The score appears justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Implements an older draft, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Uses MD5 as per protocol, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Low risk, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard WebSocket server handling handshake and messaging, no malicious code, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** No security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Varies from 0.2 to 0.7, mainly due to the use of deprecated protocols, insecure hashing (MD5), and lack of modern security practices.\n\nGiven the code's purpose and the analysis, **the core implementation is standard and does not contain malicious intent**. The main concern is its outdated protocol version and weak cryptography, which pose security risks but are not malicious per se.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimates:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — low, primarily due to outdated protocols and cryptography, but no active exploits or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, outdated WebSocket implementation with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. It poses some security risks if deployed insecurely, but these are not malicious in nature.\n\n**Recommendation:** Upgrade to current WebSocket standards, replace MD5 with secure hashes, and add validation and encryption for production deployment.",
