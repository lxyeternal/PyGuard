  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the provided assessments, and then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements WebSocket handshake and messaging, no malicious payloads or backdoors. Minor issues like a probable typo (`self.websocket`) but no security impact. Overall, standard implementation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  The low risk score seems appropriate given the absence of malicious activity, but the overall security risk is slightly elevated due to protocol obsolescence.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward, protocol-compliant implementation with no signs of malicious intent. The minor typo does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements an outdated draft WebSocket protocol, with known security issues: use of MD5, lack of validation, no encryption, and reliance on deprecated features.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4.  \n  The risk score reflects the security vulnerabilities inherent in the outdated protocol and insecure practices, but no malware or malicious code is present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is insecure by modern standards but does not appear malicious. The risk is moderate, consistent with the outdated protocol.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, outdated draft protocol, insecure hashing (MD5), no validation, vulnerable to MITM, but no malicious payloads or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.7.  \n  The high risk score is justified due to the insecure practices, even though no malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is insecure but not malicious. The high risk score aligns with the protocol's vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements an older draft WebSocket protocol, no suspicious code or malicious behavior, no backdoors, standard message handling.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  The low risk score is appropriate, given the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The implementation is standard and benign, with no security concerns beyond the protocol's obsolescence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard WebSocket server code, no malicious payloads, no suspicious code, handles handshake and messaging correctly.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  The low risk score seems justified.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected; code appears straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage. The code handles WebSocket handshake and messaging as intended, with no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Varies from 0.2 to 0.7, primarily reflecting the use of deprecated protocols and insecure hashing (MD5). These are security concerns but do not constitute malware or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.3** — considering the outdated protocol, insecure hashing, and lack of modern security measures, the overall risk is moderate but not high.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, albeit outdated, WebSocket draft protocol implementation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is security vulnerabilities due to protocol obsolescence and insecure hashing, but these do not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Therefore, my final scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.3**\n\nThese reflect a moderate security concern due to protocol and cryptographic weaknesses but confirm the absence of malicious behavior.",
