  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements WebSocket handshake and messaging per an older draft protocol. No malicious payloads, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Slight typo referencing `self.websocket`, but negligible.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a deprecated WebSocket draft, with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score seems appropriate given the context.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements a draft WebSocket handler supporting 2010 drafts, with known security issues like lack of validation, use of MD5, and deprecated protocol versions. No malicious code detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies security vulnerabilities inherent in the code (use of MD5, outdated protocols, lack of validation). The risk score of 0.4 seems appropriate, reflecting moderate security concerns but no active malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The malware score remains at 0, which is correct. The risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, emphasizing the insecure use of MD5, deprecated protocol, lack of validation, and potential for misuse. No malicious payloads.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.7.\n\n- **Assessment:** The risk score is higher here (0.7), indicating significant security concerns due to protocol obsolescence and insecure hashing. Since no malware or malicious code is present, but the code is insecure, a high risk score is justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Malware remains at 0, which is correct. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Outlines the implementation of an older draft WebSocket protocol, with no malicious code or backdoors. No obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified; the code is a standard, insecure but non-malicious WebSocket implementation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, implementing WebSocket handshake and messaging with no malicious activity or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, with no malware or malicious intent. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and based on the code review, no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code is a standard WebSocket protocol handler, albeit outdated.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Varies from 0.2 to 0.7, reflecting the security vulnerabilities inherent in using deprecated protocols, MD5 hashing, and lack of validation. These are security concerns but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.6** — Slightly higher than the highest in reports, considering the security vulnerabilities and potential for misuse in untrusted environments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.6            |\n\nThe code is a standard, outdated WebSocket implementation with known security issues but no malicious intent. The risk score should reflect the potential security vulnerabilities due to protocol obsolescence and weak hashing, but not imply active malicious behavior.",
