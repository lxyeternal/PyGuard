{
  "purpose": "To serve a cross-domain policy XML over a socket connection, likely for Flash applications requiring policy files from clients.",
  "sources": "The network socket connection initiated on port 843; socket input data (though not explicitly read here).",
  "sinks": "Sending the XML policy file via socket using socket.sendall().",
  "flows": "Connection accepted from a client → handle() method invoked → policy XML sent to client.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The XML policy is standard for Flash cross-domain policies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of gevent.server.StreamServer that listens on port 843, serving a cross-domain policy XML for Flash clients. The handle() method sends a predefined XML string to each client. There are no input reads or processing, and no data exfiltration, malicious commands, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code appears to implement a standard policy server without malicious intent. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Flash policy server. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It serves a common cross-domain policy XML without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
