  "purpose": "Serve a Cross-Domain Policy XML for Flash clients on port 843",
  "sources": "Input source: incoming socket connections to the server",
  "sinks": "Output sink: socket.sendall() sending the policy XML to clients",
  "flows": "Incoming connection -> handle() method -> socket.sendall() with policy XML",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code is straightforward and purpose-specific; no suspicious code or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server that responds with a fixed cross-domain policy XML to incoming connections on port 843. It uses gevent's StreamServer for asynchronous handling. The handle() method sends a predefined XML string without processing input data or executing any untrusted commands. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The server primarily facilitates cross-domain policy for Flash clients, which is a common and legitimate use case.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
