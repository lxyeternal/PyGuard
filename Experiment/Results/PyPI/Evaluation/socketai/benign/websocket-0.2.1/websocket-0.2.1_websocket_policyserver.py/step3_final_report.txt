  "purpose": "Implement a Flash cross-domain policy server that listens on port 843 and serves a permissive XML policy allowing all domains.",
  "sources": "Socket connection acceptance in handle() method, which triggers on incoming connections.",
  "sinks": "socket.sendall() sending static XML policy; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Connection accepted -> handle() invoked -> socket.sendall() transmits policy XML.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, serving a static policy without obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Flash cross-domain policy server using gevent's StreamServer. It listens on port 843, optionally logs connections, and responds with a static XML allowing all domains. No input processing, dynamic code, or obfuscation is present. The server's purpose is benign, serving a common policy XML. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The security concern is the permissive policy XML, which could be misused but is typical for such servers. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects the code's benign nature and policy permissiveness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate given the permissive policy XML, which could pose security concerns if misused but does not indicate malicious activity.",
