  "purpose": "This script is used to package and distribute a Python websocket library, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'websocket/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data outputs or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file; no untrusted data flow to other parts of the code.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a regex to extract version info; no anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setup tools, reads the version from a source file, and invokes the setup() function with package metadata. The version extraction method via regex on 'websocket/__init__.py' is standard for version management. No dynamic code execution, network access, or credential handling is present. No obfuscation or malicious code structures are detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
