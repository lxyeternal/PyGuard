  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard Python setup script.\n- Reads version info from 'websocket/__init__.py' via regex.\n- Calls setup() with package metadata.\n- No user input, network activity, or suspicious code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- Uses common practices for packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the code as a setup script.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No untrusted data or external sinks.\n- **Flows:** Version extracted from local file; used in setup.\n- **Anomalies:** Regex-based version extraction is common; no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior, only noting the regex approach.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (due to regex parsing, but very minimal), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also accurate; emphasizes the standard nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (again, minimal due to regex), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with others; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign setup script.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No significant errors. They uniformly recognize the code as standard, with minor notes on regex-based version extraction, which is common.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting minimal concern, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are appropriately low.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Correctly zero; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No unwarranted assumptions; all reports base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python setup script with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future changes, but based on this static analysis, the package appears safe.",
