  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script.\n- It extracts the version string via regex from 'websocket/__init__.py'.\n- It performs typical package setup tasks: specifying metadata, dependencies, and package data.\n- No user input, network operations, or external data processing are present.\n- No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** None apparent; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All consistently describe the code as a typical setup script.\n- They note the regex-based version extraction, which is common.\n- They correctly identify no untrusted data sinks, no external communication, and no suspicious code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9-1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **malware:** All 0, which is accurate.\n- **securityRisk:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified because the code performs only package setup.\n- **obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The **regex-based version extraction** is a common pattern; no issues there.\n- No evidence of **malicious intent**, **backdoors**, or **security vulnerabilities**.\n- No assumptions are made beyond the code's surface behavior.\n- The **scores assigned** in each report seem reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a **0** or very close to it is appropriate. Slightly higher (e.g., 0.1) in some reports is acceptable but not necessary.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely a setup script, there is no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.5.\n- The only minor concern could be the regex extraction, but it's a standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n- The scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal, almost negligible risk, just acknowledging the regex parsing pattern, but effectively zero in practical terms)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.",
