  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'websocket' library.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'websocket/__init__.py' via regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or user input.",
  "flows": "Version string extracted from local file and used in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for version extraction, which is common but could be fragile if source format changes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The regex-based version extraction is a common practice and does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The overall structure and content are benign and align with standard packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly zero. The minimal security risk score (0.1) accounts for the regex parsing but does not indicate any actual vulnerability.",
