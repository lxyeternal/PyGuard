{
  "purpose": "The script is used to set up and install the 'websocket' Python package by reading version information and calling the setup function with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'websocket/__init__.py' using regex; reads package files for data inclusion.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points; setup process is standard and local.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> passes data to setup() -> installs package locally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version from source file; no validation or sanitization of version string, but this is typical for setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup: it imports necessary modules, extracts version info with regex, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata. The version extraction assumes the presence of a specific pattern in 'websocket/__init__.py'. No external input or untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The setup configuration includes typical metadata and dependencies without suspicious modifications. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The script is a conventional setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
