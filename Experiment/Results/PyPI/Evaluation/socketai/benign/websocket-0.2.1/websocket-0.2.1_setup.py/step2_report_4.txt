  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library.\n- The code reads the version string from 'websocket/__init__.py' using regex, which is common.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The only minor concern is the regex-based version extraction, but it's a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n**Specifics per report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identified; no untrusted data or external sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes regex parsing, which is common.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low), confidence=0.9.\n  \n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, typical packaging code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just due to regex version extraction, which is standard)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores are reasonable and should not be adjusted upward.\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further action needed. The code is safe based on the provided analysis.",
