{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python websocket library.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'websocket/__init__.py' using a regex; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Calls the 'setup()' function with package metadata; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Extraction of version string from file -> use in setup() function; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The version extraction via regex is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup process: importing setup functions, extracting version info via regex from a file, and invoking setup() with package metadata. It does not include dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The regex-based version extraction is common practice and safe in this context. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns. It reads version info from a file and invokes setup() to prepare the package for distribution.",
