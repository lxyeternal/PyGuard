  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the websocket package including extracting version info from the source file.",
  "sources": "Reading 'websocket/__init__.py' to extract the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Reading version string from source file during setup; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Using regex to extract version info dynamically; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures; no obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads the version string from the source code using regex, which is a common practice. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependencies are standard, and there are no signs of data leakage, network communication, or malicious actions. Overall, the code appears benign and typical of a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely reads the version info and proceeds with package configuration without any suspicious activity.",
