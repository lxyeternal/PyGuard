  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup script; no malicious behavior or suspicious data flows. The only notable aspect is regex-based version extraction, which is common.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup script, no suspicious code or data handling.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern; no malicious behavior, straightforward version extraction, no suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Identical to previous; standard setup process, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Justified.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others; standard, benign setup script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports or the code snippets indicate any malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or encrypted code segments.  \n- **Risk scores:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, the risk scores are appropriately low, mostly zero or 0.1 for minor concerns related to regex parsing.\n\n### Justification for Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is correct given the code.  \n- Obfuscated=0 is also correct; no obfuscation detected.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The overall malware score should remain at **0**.  \n- The obfuscated score should be **0**.  \n- The security risk score is appropriately low, considering the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or 0.1 if considering minor regex parsing concerns, but 0 is more accurate)  \n\nThe code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
