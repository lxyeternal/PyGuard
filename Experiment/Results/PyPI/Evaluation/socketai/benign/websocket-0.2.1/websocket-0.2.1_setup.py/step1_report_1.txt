{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up a Python package named 'websocket', specifying its metadata, dependencies, and included data files.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from 'websocket/__init__.py' using a regular expression.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; setup configuration parameters do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from the source file and used in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The method of extracting version info relies on parsing the source code with regex, which is common but can be error-prone if the source format changes. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 're' and attempts to import 'setup' from 'setuptools' or falls back to 'distutils.core'. It then reads 'websocket/__init__.py' to extract the '__version__' string via regex. The version string is used in the setup() call to define package metadata. The setup configuration specifies package data, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input handling, environment variables, network operations, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The only notable aspect is the regex-based version extraction, which is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.",
