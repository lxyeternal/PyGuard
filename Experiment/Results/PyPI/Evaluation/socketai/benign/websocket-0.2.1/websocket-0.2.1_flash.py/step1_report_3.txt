{
  "purpose": "Starts a WebSocket flash policy server that listens for incoming connections.",
  "sources": "The code imports the FlashPolicyServer class and initializes it; the server reads network configuration during start.",
  "sinks": "Network socket binding (server.start(), server.serve_forever()) potentially exposes server ports; no other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Server initialization and start flow from creation to listening on network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The script simply starts a policy server with no additional logic or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard module from websocket.policyserver, creates an instance with a 'noisy' flag set to True, and starts the server to listen for WebSocket connections. It outputs the server's address to standard error. The code appears to be a minimal, straightforward server setup without any obfuscated or malicious code. No suspicious data handling, external data transmission, or system modifications are present. The only point of potential concern is whether the server is exposed unintentionally, but this is typical for a WebSocket policy server and does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic WebSocket policy server setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation for enabling WebSocket connections via a flash policy server.",
