  "purpose": "Start a WebSocket flash policy server to handle policy requests for Flash clients.",
  "sources": "Importing the FlashPolicyServer class from websocket.policyserver, initializing and starting the server.",
  "sinks": "The server listens on network sockets; no untrusted data sinks are explicitly present in the code.",
  "flows": "Initialization of server object -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever() (listening loop).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code merely starts a standard server.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a WebSocket policy server class, instantiates it with noisy output enabled, and starts the server to listen for incoming policy requests. It outputs its listening address to standard error. No untrusted input handling, no suspicious network connections beyond the standard server operation, and no malicious code present. The code appears to be a straightforward server setup with no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets up and runs a WebSocket Flash policy server without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard implementation for serving Flash policy files, with no malicious or security-risk indicators.",
