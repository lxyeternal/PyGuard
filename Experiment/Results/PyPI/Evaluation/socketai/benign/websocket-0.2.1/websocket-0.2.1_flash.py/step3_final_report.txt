  "purpose": "Setup and run a legacy Flash WebSocket policy server to serve cross-domain policy files.",
  "sources": "Importing FlashPolicyServer from websocket.policyserver, creating server instance, server.start(), server.serve_forever()",
  "sinks": "Network port listening for policy requests, no untrusted data handling or external input",
  "flows": "Server initialization -> start listening -> serve_forever loop",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward server setup, no obfuscation, no suspicious code or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, direct implementation of a Flash policy server with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not process external input, handle credentials, or perform network actions beyond listening. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The use of legacy Flash technology is outdated but not malicious. The server's exposure is typical for such services, and the code's simplicity indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate due to legacy technology, not active vulnerabilities.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
