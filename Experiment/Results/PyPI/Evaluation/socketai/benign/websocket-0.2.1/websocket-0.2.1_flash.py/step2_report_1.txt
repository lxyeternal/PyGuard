  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scoring, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe a simple setup of a WebSocket Flash policy server, instantiated via `FlashPolicyServer` from `websocket.policyserver`.\n- No external input, credentials, or data manipulation are involved.\n- The server is started and runs indefinitely, listening for policy requests.\n- No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is detected.\n- The use of a Flash policy server indicates legacy technology, but this alone is not malicious.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Code correctness and issues:**\n\n- The code as provided is straightforward and matches the descriptions.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The server is initiated and run as intended for a Flash policy server.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Errors or flaws:**\n\n- No errors or mistakes are evident in the code logic.\n- The use of deprecated Flash technology could be noted as a potential security concern due to legacy issues, but not an immediate vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n\n**Malware score:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n**Risk score:**\n\n- The risk scores are mostly 0.1 or 0.0, reflecting minimal security concern.\n- The only slight variation is a 0.1 in some reports, possibly due to the legacy nature of Flash, which could be considered a security concern in modern contexts.\n\n**Justification for higher risk scores:**\n\n- If a risk score were to be higher than 0.5, it would need to be justified by actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity, which is not present here.\n- The use of legacy Flash technology could be flagged as a security concern, but not a direct vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' conclusions.\n- Given the benign nature, no adjustments are necessary unless considering the legacy aspect as a security risk, which would be more about best practices than an actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to legacy technology, not actual security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects the outdated technology rather than an active threat.\n\n**Final note:** For modern security standards, replacing or removing legacy Flash policy servers is advisable, but this does not constitute a security incident.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and the scores are appropriate. The only concern is the legacy status of Flash, which is not a direct security vulnerability but worth noting for modernization.\n\n**If I were to assign scores independently:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0.1** (due to legacy tech)",
