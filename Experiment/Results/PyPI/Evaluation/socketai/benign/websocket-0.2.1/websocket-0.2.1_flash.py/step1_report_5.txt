{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and starts a WebSocket Flash Policy Server to listen for incoming connections.",
  "sources": "import sys, websocket.policyserver (specifically server.start() and server.serve_forever()), reading server_host and server_port for logging",
  "sinks": "Printing server host and port information to standard error; no other data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Server initialization → server.start() / server.serve_forever() → logging to stderr",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated Flash policy server which is not inherently malicious but indicates legacy technology; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed; no network communications beyond server start; no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a WebSocket policy server class, initializes it with noisy=True, starts the server, and logs the listening address. It does not process user input or handle untrusted data beyond server startup. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The use of a Flash policy server is legacy but not malicious per se. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a straightforward setup for a WebSocket Flash policy server, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is primarily legacy technology and does not perform any harmful actions.",
