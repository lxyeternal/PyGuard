{
  "purpose": "This script initializes and starts a WebSocket flash policy server, primarily for handling flash policy requests.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and uses internal class instantiation. The server object is created without user input.",
  "sinks": "The server's start and serve_forever methods initiate network operations, but there are no evident data sinks or untrusted data handling in the script.",
  "flows": "The script flows from importing the policy server module, creating the server instance, starting it, printing status, and then running the server loop indefinitely.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets up and runs a WebSocket policy server using the 'websocket.policyserver' module. It does not process untrusted input directly, nor does it contain any obfuscated or malicious constructs. The server's default behavior and the import are typical for establishing a flash policy service. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup for a WebSocket flash policy server. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet.",
