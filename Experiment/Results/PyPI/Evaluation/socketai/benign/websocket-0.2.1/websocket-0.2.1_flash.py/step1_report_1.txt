{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and starts a Flash policy server for handling WebSocket connections, primarily to serve cross-domain policy files.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly, but the server may handle WebSocket connection requests.",
  "sinks": "The server potentially sends data over the network as part of the policy server's operation.",
  "flows": "The server starts upon execution, listens on a specified host and port, and runs indefinitely serving WebSocket policy requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or malicious code are present. Usage of a Flash policy server might be outdated or potentially misused, but no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a FlashPolicyServer class and starts it, which is used to serve cross-domain policy files for Flash applications. It prints server details to stderr and runs the server indefinitely. No user input, credentials, or data manipulation occurs. The code does not perform any suspicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity. It simply sets up a server for a specific purpose. The comments indicate awareness of the server's default behavior. There is no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Flash policy server, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It facilitates WebSocket cross-domain requests, which could be misused if deployed maliciously, but the code itself is benign.",
