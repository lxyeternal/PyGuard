{
  "purpose": "A WebSocket server that serves static files and broadcasts status messages periodically to connected clients.",
  "sources": "Reading static files ('json.js' or 'follower.html') based on URL path; receiving data from sockets via socket.receive().",
  "sinks": "socket.send() method for transmitting messages to clients.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the server's broadcast message generation to socket.send() calls; static file content read from disk and served over HTTP response.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert message is None' after socket.receive(), which can cause crashes if a message is received; static file paths are fixed and not sanitized, but this is typical for such servers.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a WebSocket server with static file serving and periodic broadcasting. It manages sockets with a set, spawns tasks for receiving and sending messages, and handles exceptions gracefully. No malicious payloads, covert channels, or backdoors are present. The use of 'assert message is None' is unconventional but not malicious; it could cause crashes if a message is received, indicating a potential stability issue but not malicious intent. The static file serving relies on fixed filenames, which do not introduce injection risks given controlled filenames. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign WebSocket server with standard features. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity is evident. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal vulnerabilities related to static file handling and socket management. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent.",
