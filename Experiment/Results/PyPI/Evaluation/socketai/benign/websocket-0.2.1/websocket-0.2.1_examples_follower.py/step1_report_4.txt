{
  "purpose": "The code implements a simple web application that serves static files and manages websocket connections, periodically broadcasting status messages to connected clients.",
  "sources": "environ['PATH_INFO'], environ.get('websocket'), open(path), socket.receive(), socket.getpeername()",
  "sinks": "socket.send(), open(file).read(), print statements, gevent.spawn for asynchronous tasks",
  "flows": "environ['PATH_INFO'] -> serve_file() -> open() reading file -> socket.send() in update() -> print statements in receive()",
  "anomalies": "Use of print for exception handling and debugging, no input validation on file paths, use of broad except clauses, no authentication or validation of websocket data",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web application with websocket support, serving static files and broadcasting messages to all connected clients. It uses gevent for concurrency. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Exception handling is broad, but no malicious or suspicious logic is evident. The server broadcasts status messages indicating active connections. No obfuscated code or backdoors are detected. The design appears straightforward and benign, focusing on real-time websocket messaging without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple websocket-enabled web server broadcasting status updates. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident based on static analysis. The overall security risk is low.",
