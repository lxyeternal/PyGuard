{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'uwsgitop' Python package, defining metadata and dependencies for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file to set long_description; reads package metadata variables; specifies script files and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no execution of untrusted input or sensitive data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a local README file is normal; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures. The install_requires conditionally includes 'argparse' for Python versions below 3, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup, defines version info, and calls setup() with package metadata, including maintainer info, description, URL, license, and scripts. It reads a local README file for long_description, which is typical. The only conditional dependency 'argparse' for Python <3 is standard and not suspicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
