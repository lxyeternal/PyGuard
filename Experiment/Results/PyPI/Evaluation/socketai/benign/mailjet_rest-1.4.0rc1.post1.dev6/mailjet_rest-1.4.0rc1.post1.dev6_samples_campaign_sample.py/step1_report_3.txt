{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Mailjet API to create and manage email campaigns, including drafting, content addition, testing, scheduling, and sending emails.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for API keys; reads campaign and draft IDs (placeholder strings); reads data structures for email content and scheduling.",
  "sinks": "Calls Mailjet API endpoints that perform actions like creating drafts, adding content, testing, scheduling, and sending campaigns.",
  "flows": "API keys from environment variables flow into Client constructors; campaign IDs and email content flow from functions into API calls; data for email content and scheduling flow directly into API request payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of placeholder variables (e.g., '$draft_ID', '$ID_CONTACTSLIST') suggests this code is intended as a template or example. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present besides environment variables. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily composes and sends API requests to Mailjet for email marketing workflows. It securely retrieves API keys from environment variables, avoiding hardcoded secrets. The code uses placeholder strings for campaign and draft IDs, indicating the code is designed to be configured externally before use. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The functions are straightforward wrappers around API endpoints, and the overall structure is typical for email automation scripts. No unusual behavior, code injection, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious script for managing email campaigns via Mailjet. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The use of placeholders suggests it is a template intended for legitimate use, assuming proper configuration. No security risks or malicious behavior are evident.",
