  "purpose": "This code manages email campaigns via Mailjet API, including creating drafts, adding content, testing, scheduling, and sending.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API keys (MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC, MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE), placeholder variables like $draft_ID and $ID_CONTACTSLIST.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Mailjet endpoints for campaign creation, content addition, testing, scheduling, and sending.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from environment variables → API request construction with placeholders → API calls to Mailjet endpoints for campaign operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder variables ($draft_ID, $ID_CONTACTSLIST) indicating incomplete or template code; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with Mailjet's API using environment variables for credentials, following best practices. Placeholders suggest it is a template or incomplete implementation, not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The API calls are standard and directed at trusted endpoints. The overall structure is straightforward, with no suspicious logic or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, template-like API client for Mailjet email campaign management. It contains placeholders indicating incomplete setup but no malicious intent or activity. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The code is safe for use once placeholders are properly replaced.",
