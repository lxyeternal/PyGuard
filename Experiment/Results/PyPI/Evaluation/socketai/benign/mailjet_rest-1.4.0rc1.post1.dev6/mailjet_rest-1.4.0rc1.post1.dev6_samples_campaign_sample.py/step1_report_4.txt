{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with Mailjet API to create and manage email campaigns, including drafting, content addition, testing, scheduling, and sending.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API keys (os.environ['MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC'], os.environ['MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE']), hardcoded email addresses, static data within functions.",
  "sinks": "Mailjet API methods that send email campaign data and request actions, especially create, test, schedule, and send endpoints.",
  "flows": "API key sources are used for authentication; campaign data flows into API calls for creation, testing, scheduling, and sending emails.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder strings like '$ID_CONTACTSLIST' and '$draft_ID' suggests placeholder data; no actual hardcoded credentials or secrets besides environment variables; no obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs legitimate API interactions for email campaign management. Environment variables are used for API credentials, reducing risk of hardcoded secrets. The functions generate data for various campaign steps, with placeholders indicating incomplete or template code. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. All API endpoints and data formats appear standard and aligned with Mailjet's documentation. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious commands. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and intended for email campaign automation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Mailjet API interactions for email campaigns with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of placeholders suggests it is a template or in-development code rather than malicious payloads. No security risks or malware detected.",
