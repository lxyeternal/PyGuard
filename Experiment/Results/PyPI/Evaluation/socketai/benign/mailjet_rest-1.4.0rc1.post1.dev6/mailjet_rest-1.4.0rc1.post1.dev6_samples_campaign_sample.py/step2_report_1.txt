  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code interacts with Mailjet API for email campaign management.\n- Uses environment variables for API keys, which is good.\n- Contains placeholder strings like `$ID_CONTACTSLIST` and `$draft_ID`.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials besides environment variables.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or malicious network activity.\n- The code appears to be a template or incomplete implementation, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard email campaign script.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identified.\n- **Anomalies:** Placeholder variables like `$ID_CONTACTSLIST`, `$draft_ID`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; code is legitimate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, non-malicious; placeholders suggest incomplete code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 (low, reasonable)\n- Confidence: 0.9 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with detailed reasoning.\n- Emphasizes the use of environment variables, placeholders, and standard API interactions.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar assessment, noting the use of placeholders and environment variables.\n- No suspicious code or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern, emphasizing the placeholders and safe API interactions.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar conclusion, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- No obfuscation or malicious signs.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's nature, this score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign **0**; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** The risk score is consistently low (0.2), which is reasonable given the code's functionality and placeholders.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- Since the code contains placeholders like `$draft_ID` and `$ID_CONTACTSLIST`, which suggest incomplete or template code, it might be prudent to reflect this explicitly as a **minor concern**. However, since no malicious activity is present, this does not warrant a higher risk score.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** **0.2** remains appropriate, as placeholders do not introduce significant risk.\n- **Confidence:** **0.9** remains justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, template-like API client for Mailjet, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The placeholder variables suggest incomplete implementation but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk | Confidence |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2            | 0.9        |\n\nThis assessment aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
