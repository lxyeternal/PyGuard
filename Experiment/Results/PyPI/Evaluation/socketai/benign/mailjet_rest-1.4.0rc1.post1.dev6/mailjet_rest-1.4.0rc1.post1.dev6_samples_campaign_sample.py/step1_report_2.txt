{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Mailjet API to create and manage email campaigns, including creating drafts, adding content, testing, scheduling, and sending campaigns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC' and 'MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE' for API authentication; hardcoded email addresses and campaign data within functions; input parameters for API calls such as 'draft_ID' and contact lists.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Mailjet endpoints that send data over the network, including campaign details, email content, recipient info, and scheduling data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide API credentials (source). Functions construct data payloads and invoke Mailjet API methods (flow). API methods transmit data over the network to Mailjet servers (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no use of dynamic execution, or misleading variable names. The code uses placeholder strings like '$draft_ID' and '$ID_CONTACTSLIST' instead of actual dynamic data, which might indicate incomplete or template code rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs authorized interactions with Mailjet's API to manage email campaigns. It uses environment variables for sensitive credentials, avoiding hardcoding secrets. The functions construct JSON payloads for various campaign-related operations, such as creating drafts, adding content, testing, scheduling, and sending emails. All network communications are directed to trusted Mailjet endpoints. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The use of placeholder variables ('$draft_ID', '$ID_CONTACTSLIST') suggests the code is meant to be integrated with other systems or scripts that provide real values, not indicative of malicious tampering. There are no signs of malicious data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or harmful operations beyond standard API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client script for managing email campaigns via Mailjet. It securely manages API credentials using environment variables and constructs legitimate API requests. No evidence of malicious intent or malware is present. The placeholders indicate it may be part of a larger, templated system. Overall, the script appears safe and non-malicious.",
