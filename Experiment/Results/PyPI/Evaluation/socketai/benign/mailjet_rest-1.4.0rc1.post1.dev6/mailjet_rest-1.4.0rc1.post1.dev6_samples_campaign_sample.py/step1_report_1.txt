{
  "purpose": "This code interacts with the Mailjet API to create and manage email campaigns, including drafting, adding content, testing, scheduling, and sending emails.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables 'MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC' and 'MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE' for API authentication; it also uses hardcoded strings for email addresses, campaign data, and draft IDs.",
  "sinks": "The code makes API calls to Mailjet endpoints which send emails and create campaign data. No untrusted input is directly used in critical API calls beyond predefined variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide API credentials (source). Functions assemble data and invoke Mailjet API methods (sink). Data flows from environment variables and hardcoded values into API calls.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of placeholder variables like '$ID_CONTACTSLIST' and '$draft_ID' suggests incomplete or template-like code. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident besides environment variables. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves API keys from environment variables, which is best practice. It performs structured API interactions for campaign management. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found, and the API endpoints are standard for Mailjet. The use of placeholder strings indicates the code may be a template or incomplete implementation, but it does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious network activity. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate email campaign script with proper practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard email campaign management script interfacing with Mailjet API. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. Usage of placeholders suggests incomplete implementation, but no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
