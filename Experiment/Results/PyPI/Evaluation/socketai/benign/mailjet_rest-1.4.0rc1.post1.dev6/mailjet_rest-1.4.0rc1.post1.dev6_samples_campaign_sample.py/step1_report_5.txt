{
  "purpose": "The script manages email campaign drafts, content, testing, scheduling, and sending via the Mailjet API.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for API keys; hardcoded data for email campaign details; static draft IDs used in functions.",
  "sinks": "Mailjet API endpoints that send or modify email campaigns; potential exposure of email addresses and campaign data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide API credentials -> API calls perform campaign operations -> Data passed to API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder values like '$ID_CONTACTSLIST' and '$draft_ID' suggests incomplete or dummy data; no actual secret keys or sensitive data hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes environment variables for API authentication, which is good practice. The functions construct data payloads for email campaigns, including recipient info and content, then invoke Mailjet API methods. No hardcoded credentials or secrets besides environment variables. The placeholders such as '$draft_ID' indicate the functions are designed to be used with actual dynamic IDs. The code does not perform any suspicious actions like network data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoor functionalities. No malicious code, backdoors, or malware signatures are detected. The API calls are standard for managing email campaigns. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward email campaign management script with no malicious intent or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate email campaign management utility that interacts with Mailjet's API. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The use of placeholders suggests it is intended to be used with actual campaign data supplied at runtime. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious code. Overall, it is a benign and standard implementation for email campaign automation.",
