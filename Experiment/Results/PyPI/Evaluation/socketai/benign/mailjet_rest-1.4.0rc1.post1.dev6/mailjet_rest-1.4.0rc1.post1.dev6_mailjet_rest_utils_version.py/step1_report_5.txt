  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling and formatting version information of the Mailjet REST API client.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version string from mailjet_rest._version.__version__.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output effects that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The package version string is read and processed by regex matching, then used in internal functions; no external data flows or untrusted input processing beyond internal package version.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Regex is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or external network interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly extracts version info from a package string using regex and converts it into a tuple. The get_version function validates the tuple length and formats it into a string. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code performs standard version parsing and formatting tasks without external dependencies or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for version handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
