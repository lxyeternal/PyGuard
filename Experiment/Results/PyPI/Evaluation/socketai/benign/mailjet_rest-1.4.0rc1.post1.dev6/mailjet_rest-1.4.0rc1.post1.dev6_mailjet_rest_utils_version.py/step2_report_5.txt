  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward utility for version parsing and formatting.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, external data handling, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code relies on regex for version string extraction, which is standard and safe in this context.\n- The source of the version string is an imported module attribute, with no external inputs or network activity.\n- The functions perform validation and formatting, with proper error handling.\n\n**Assessment of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, with confidence level 1.\n- No anomalies, suspicious flows, or security risks are identified.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, as expected.\n- The purpose and analysis descriptions are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- The only minor point is that the `clean_version` function defaults to `(0,0,0)` if the version string is invalid or empty, which might mask issues with the version string source. However, this is a safe fallback and not malicious.\n- The regex used is straightforward and does not pose any security concern.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, is present.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is appropriate; the code performs a benign utility function with no security implications.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a simple, safe utility module for version handling. It does not pose any security risks or malicious threats. The reports' assessments are accurate and well-justified.",
