  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling version strings of the Mailjet REST API client, including cleaning version strings and retrieving the formatted version.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the __version__ attribute imported from mailjet_rest._version and from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Formats version information into strings; does not write or transmit data to external sources.",
  "flows": "Reads package_version, cleans it into a tuple, then formats it into a version string. No external data flow beyond internal processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of regex appears straightforward; no dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a version string, cleans it via regex into a tuple, and provides a function to format the version. The cleaning function defaults to (0,0,0) if no version or invalid version string is provided, which is a safe fallback. The get_version function validates the tuple length and formats it as a string. There are no external data transmissions, environment variable manipulations, or security-sensitive operations. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version handling and string formatting with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a simple utility module without harmful behavior.",
