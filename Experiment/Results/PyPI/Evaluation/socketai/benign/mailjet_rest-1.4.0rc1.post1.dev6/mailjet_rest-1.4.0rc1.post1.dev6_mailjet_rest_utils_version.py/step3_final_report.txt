  "purpose": "Provides version handling utilities for the Mailjet REST API client, including parsing and formatting version strings.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from mailjet_rest._version.__version__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "The version string is parsed by regex in 'clean_version' and then used in 'get_version' for formatting",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex parsing, default fallback to (0,0,0), no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string, cleans it with a simple regex, and provides functions to retrieve a formatted version string. It performs validation on input tuples and defaults to (0,0,0) if parsing fails. No external data handling, network activity, or secrets are involved. The regex is safe, and the logic is clear. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for version management with no security risks or malicious intent. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation.",
