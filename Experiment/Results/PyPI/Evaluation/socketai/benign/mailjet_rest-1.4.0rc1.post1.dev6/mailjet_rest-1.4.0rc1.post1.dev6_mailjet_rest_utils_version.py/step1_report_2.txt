  "purpose": "Utility module for handling version information of the Mailjet REST API client.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from mailjet_rest._version.__version__ and input parameter 'version' in get_version.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not output untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The version string is processed internally and returned; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; the regex is straightforward for version parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly extracts and formats version information, ensuring the version tuple has exactly three elements. It includes input validation and exception raising for malformed data. No external calls, no data leaks, and no dynamic execution are observed. It functions purely as a version utility, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for version handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It processes version data securely and predictably.",
