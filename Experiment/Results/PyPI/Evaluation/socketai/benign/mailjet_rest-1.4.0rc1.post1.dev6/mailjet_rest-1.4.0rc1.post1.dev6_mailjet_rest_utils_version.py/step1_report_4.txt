  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling and retrieving the version of the Mailjet REST API client.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'mailjet_rest._version.__version__' and input parameter 'version' in get_version function.",
  "sinks": "Formats version string output; does not write or transmit data outside the process.",
  "flows": "Reads version string -> parses with regex -> converts to tuple -> formats string for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of regex is standard. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, and no data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves the version string from an imported module, cleans and parses it with a regex to ensure it is in the 'X.Y.Z' format, and provides functions to format and validate version tuples. No input/output operations involve untrusted data sources, and the code performs straightforward string and tuple manipulations. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for version management, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
