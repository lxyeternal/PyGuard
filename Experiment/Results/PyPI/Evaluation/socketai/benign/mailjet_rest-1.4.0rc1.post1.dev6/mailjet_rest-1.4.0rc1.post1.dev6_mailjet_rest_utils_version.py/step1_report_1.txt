  "purpose": "Provides versioning utilities for the Mailjet REST API client, including retrieving and cleaning version strings.",
  "sources": "Imports '__version__' from mailjet_rest._version to obtain the package version.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external inputs.",
  "flows": "The package_version source flows into the clean_version function, which outputs the cleaned version tuple used by get_version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a version string from a module, cleans it using regex, and provides functions to return the version in string format. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or sensitive data handling. The code primarily performs string parsing and formatting, which are safe operations. No suspicious behaviors or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for managing version information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
