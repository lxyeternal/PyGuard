  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward utility for version string handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are mentioned or evident.\n- The code performs simple regex parsing, validation, and string formatting.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code correctly imports a version string and processes it.\n- The regex used is straightforward and appropriate for extracting \"X.Y.Z\" format.\n- The fallback to `(0, 0, 0)` on invalid input is safe.\n- The validation in `get_version` ensures the tuple has exactly three elements.\n\n**No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws, errors, or suspicious points:\n- The `clean_version` function returns `(0, 0, 0)` if the version string is empty or doesn't match the regex. This is acceptable, but it could potentially mask malformed version strings. However, since the code defaults to `(0, 0, 0)` and the `get_version` function validates the tuple length, this is safe.\n- The regex pattern is simple and does not handle pre-release or build metadata (e.g., \"1.2.3-beta\"). This could be a limitation but not a security concern.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present.\n\n**No logical errors or security flaws are identified.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Correct.\n- **Malware:** 0 — Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0 — Correct; no risks detected.\n\nThe scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None are necessary; the code is benign, with a risk score of 0 justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all observations are based on code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a simple, safe utility module.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, well-structured utility with no security concerns.",
