  "purpose": "Defines the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "The version string includes a pre-release and post-release tags, but this is common and not suspicious. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string indicating a pre-release ('rc1'), post-release ('post1'), and development ('dev6') tags to the variable __version__. There are no other code elements, input/output operations, or dynamic behaviors. The version string appears standard and does not suggest malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple version assignment with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is standard practice for versioning in Python packages.",
