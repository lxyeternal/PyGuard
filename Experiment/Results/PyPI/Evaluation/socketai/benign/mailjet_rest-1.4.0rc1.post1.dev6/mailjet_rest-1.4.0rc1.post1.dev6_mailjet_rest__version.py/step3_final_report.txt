  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the version string; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of pre-release tags (rc, post, dev) in version string, which are common in development versions but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with pre-release tags. No input, output, or data processing occurs. The version string's content is typical for development versions and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action is necessary.",
