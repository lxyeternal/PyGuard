  "purpose": "Defines the version string of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The code itself does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists in this isolated statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-standard, complex version string with multiple qualifiers (rc, post, dev) which may indicate pre-release or development state, but not malicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment setting the __version__ variable to a string indicating the package version. There are no data reads, no untrusted data inputs, no processing or output. The version string contains pre-release tags but no suspicious or malicious patterns. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. Since this is a common way to specify version info, it does not suggest malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version assignment statement without any malicious or suspicious elements. It simply indicates the version of the package or module. No security risks or malware are detected.",
