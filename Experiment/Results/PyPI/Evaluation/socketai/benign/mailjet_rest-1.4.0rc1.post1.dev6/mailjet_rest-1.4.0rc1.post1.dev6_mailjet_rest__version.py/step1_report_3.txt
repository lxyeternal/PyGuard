  "anomalies": "Version string includes pre-release and development indicators, but this is common for versioning; no unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. The version string indicates a pre-release and development version, which is typical for ongoing development. No input, output, or data processing occurs. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscation or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
