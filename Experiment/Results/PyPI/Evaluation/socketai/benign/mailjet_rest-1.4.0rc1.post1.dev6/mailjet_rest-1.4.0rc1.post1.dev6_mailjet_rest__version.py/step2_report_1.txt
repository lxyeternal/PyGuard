  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n1. **Code Content**: `__version__ = \"1.4.0rc1.post1.dev6\"`\n\n---\n\n### Confirm if issues are present:\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No input reading, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- The version string contains pre-release tags (`rc`, `post`, `dev`), which are common in versioning but do not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the version string and note the absence of malicious patterns.\n- No false positives or negatives are evident.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code is present.\n\n**Verdict**: The reports are well-reasoned and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Suggestion**: No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since all reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` as 0, and the code is a simple version string assignment, there is no justification for higher scores.\n- The `malware` score should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The `securityRisk` score should also stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all interpret the version string as a normal pre-release indicator.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are inferred.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Overall conclusion**:\nThe code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThe version string contains pre-release tags but nothing suspicious or malicious. The code is safe and typical for version declaration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The reports are correct.\n- The scores are justified.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
