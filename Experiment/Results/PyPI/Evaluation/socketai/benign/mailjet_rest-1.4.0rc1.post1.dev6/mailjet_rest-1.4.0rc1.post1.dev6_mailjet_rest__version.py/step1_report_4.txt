  "purpose": "Defines the version string of the package or module",
  "sources": "The assignment of the version string to the __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external output",
  "flows": "N/A, simple assignment without data flow or external influence",
  "anomalies": "The version string includes a complex pre-release and development suffix, but this is common in development versions; no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, indicating package versioning. The string '1.4.0rc1.post1.dev6' suggests a release candidate with post-release and development identifiers. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no code execution beyond this assignment. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version string assignment with no malicious intent or security issues. It is typical for package versioning and does not pose any security risk.",
