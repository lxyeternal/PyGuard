{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python module that wraps the Mailjet API client and version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from mailjet_rest.client and mailjet_rest.utils.version modules, as well as the get_version function call.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data or external inputs processed directly in this code.",
  "flows": "The code calls get_version() and assigns its result to __version__, which is then exposed. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and relies on external modules for functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and defines package metadata. It calls get_version() to set __version__, and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no inputs, no processing of untrusted data, and no side effects. It appears to be standard package initialization code with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard package module initialization with no malicious behavior detected. It simply exposes API components and version info. No security risks or malware are present.",
