{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the mailjet_rest package by importing core components and setting version attributes, serving as an entry point for users to interact with the Mailjet API.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information via get_version(), imports classes and functions from mailjet_rest modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code primarily sets up module attributes and imports.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function provides version info, and imported classes/functions are exposed for API interactions but do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module initialization by importing classes and functions, setting version attributes, and defining the public API. All operations are straightforward and typical for package setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module setup script for the mailjet_rest package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports necessary components, sets version info, and defines API exports.",
