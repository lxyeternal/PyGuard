  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is straightforward module setup, importing classes and functions, setting version attributes. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are zero, which is appropriate. Security risk is zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, standard package initialization. The get_version() function could access external sources, but this is typical and not suspicious.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware remains zero, obfuscated zero, security risk low (0.2) which is acceptable given the potential external access during version retrieval.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Again, standard import and attribute setup. No malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are zero, security risk is zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** The only potential concern is the get_version() call, which could be malicious if compromised. However, based on the code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No, but it’s worth noting that if get_version() is malicious, it could pose a risk, but this cannot be confirmed from this code alone.\n- **Scores:** Malware is zero, obfuscated zero, security risk zero. Given the information, this is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others, standard setup.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Correctly zero for malware and obfuscated, security risk minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign zero, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Most are zero; one report assigns 0.2, which is acceptable given the potential for external access during version retrieval, but not indicative of a real security risk.\n\n### Final remarks:\n- The code is a typical package initialization script, importing modules, setting version info, and exposing API components.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The only minor point is the call to `get_version()`, which could access external data, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (standard package setup, no security issues)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
