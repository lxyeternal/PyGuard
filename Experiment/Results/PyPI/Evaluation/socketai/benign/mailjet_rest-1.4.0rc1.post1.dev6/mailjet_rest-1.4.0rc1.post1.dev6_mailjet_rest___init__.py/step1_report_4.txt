{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the `mailjet_rest` package by importing core components and exposing public API attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing `Client` from `mailjet_rest.client` and `get_version` from `mailjet_rest.utils.version`.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of `__version__` using `get_version()`, which could potentially be malicious if `get_version()` is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and functions -> calling `get_version()` -> assigning its output to `__version__`.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code appears straightforward with standard import and assignment statements. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and functions necessary for the package's operation, then assigns a version string via `get_version()`. This is typical package initialization. The only potential concern is the call to `get_version()`, which could be malicious if the function is compromised. However, based on standard practice and the limited code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code execution. The code does not perform network communication, data collection, or any other suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple initialization script for the `mailjet_rest` package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
