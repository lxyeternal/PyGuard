  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, the validity of the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard package initialization, importing components, setting version info, and defining API exports.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo suspicious behavior, no external data processing, no obfuscation, and no malware indicators. The reasoning is sound. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that `get_version()` might access external sources but considers this standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe mention that `get_version()` could access external sources is valid, but this is typical for version functions. The risk score of 0.2 reflects a minimal concern, which is reasonable. No malicious activity is indicated. The reasoning is consistent, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard package initialization with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll points are consistent. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any risky operations. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that `get_version()` could be malicious if compromised, but finds no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe concern about `get_version()` potentially being malicious is valid in theory, but without evidence, it's speculative. The code itself is straightforward, and no malicious activity is detected. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard package setup, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues detected; the reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and standard pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.2, reflecting minimal concern about `get_version()` possibly accessing external sources. This is a reasonable assessment given the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a straightforward package initialization script, importing modules, setting version info, and defining API exports. No untrusted data flows, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The minor concern about `get_version()` is acknowledged but not substantiated by any evidence, so a low risk score is justified.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a slight increase over 0 to reflect the theoretical concern, but still very low)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected.",
