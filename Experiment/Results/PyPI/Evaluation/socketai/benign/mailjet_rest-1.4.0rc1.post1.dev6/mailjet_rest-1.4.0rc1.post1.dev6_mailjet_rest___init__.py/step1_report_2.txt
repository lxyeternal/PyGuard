{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports for the mailjet_rest package, facilitating API interactions with Mailjet.",
  "sources": "Import statements from mailjet_rest.client and mailjet_rest.utils.version, and the get_version() function call.",
  "sinks": "The assignment of __version__ using get_version(), which may access external version data.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function retrieves version info and assigns it to __version__, no external data flows beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_version() to set __version__ is standard; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of module-level docstring, imports, and attribute definitions. The get_version() call could access external sources or files, but this is typical for version functions. No suspicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The structure and syntax are straightforward and standard for a Python package's initialization module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It mainly handles metadata and imports, with no external data leaks or harmful activities detected.",
