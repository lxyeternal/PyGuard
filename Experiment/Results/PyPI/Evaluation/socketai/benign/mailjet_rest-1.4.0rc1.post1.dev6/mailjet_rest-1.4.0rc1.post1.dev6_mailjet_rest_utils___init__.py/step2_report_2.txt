  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely documentation or comments, with no executable logic.\n- The code snippet is minimal, consisting only of descriptive comments about the package and its modules.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are identified.\n- The mention of 'versionI' appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, descriptive nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of executable code or security concerns.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- The descriptions are thorough in ruling out malicious activity.\n- The only minor point is the mention of 'versionI' which appears to be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The overall assessment is that this code snippet is benign, purely documentation, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual content of the code.\n\n**Final note:**\n- No changes needed; the assessments are accurate and consistent.",
