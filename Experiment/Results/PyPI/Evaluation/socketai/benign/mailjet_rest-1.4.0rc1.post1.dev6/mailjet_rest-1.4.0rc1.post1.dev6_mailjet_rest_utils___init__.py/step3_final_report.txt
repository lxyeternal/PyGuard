  "purpose": "The code provides descriptive documentation for the `mailjet_rest.utils` package, specifically mentioning version management modules.",
  "sources": "The comments and docstrings within the package, including the mention of 'versionI'.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no executable code or data flows present.",
  "flows": "None, since the code is purely documentation without runtime data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "The mention of 'versionI' appears to be a typo or placeholder, but it is benign and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of descriptive comments and docstrings with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign documentation. The mention of 'versionI' is a minor typo, not a security concern. Scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely documentation with no executable or malicious content. All reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign, non-executable nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
