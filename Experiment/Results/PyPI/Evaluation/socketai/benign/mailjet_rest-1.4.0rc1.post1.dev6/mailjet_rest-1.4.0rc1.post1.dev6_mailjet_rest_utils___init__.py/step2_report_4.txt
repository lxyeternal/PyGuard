  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the provided code is purely a docstring/comment describing the package and its modules. There is no executable code, data handling, or external interactions present. Therefore, no issues such as data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports mention the phrase \"versionI,\" which appears to be a typo or placeholder, but this is a minor documentation inconsistency and not a security concern.  \n- No report claims the presence of executable code, which aligns with the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the content.  \n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature of the code.  \n- The reports correctly interpret the code as non-executable documentation, so no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**  \n- Since the code is only documentation, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.  \n- No assumptions about hidden or embedded malicious code are justified here, as no such code exists.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Personal Estimation**  \n- The provided assessments are consistent and accurate.  \n- Given the absence of executable code, data flows, or suspicious patterns, I agree with the reported malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 across all reports.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- The malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk scores should remain at **0**.  \n- The confidence scores are appropriate at **1**.  \n- The reports are thorough and correctly interpret the code snippet as benign documentation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a straightforward, non-executable package documentation comment with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
