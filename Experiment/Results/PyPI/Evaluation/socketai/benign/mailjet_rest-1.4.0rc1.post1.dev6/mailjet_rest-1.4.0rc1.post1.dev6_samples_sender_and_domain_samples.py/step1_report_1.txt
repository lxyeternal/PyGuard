{
  "purpose": "The script interacts with the Mailjet API to perform DNS validation, sender validation, and other email-related operations, likely for email configuration or verification tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for API keys (MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC and MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE), and uses hardcoded IDs ('$dns_ID', '$sender_ID') for API requests.",
  "sinks": "Calls API endpoints that perform DNS lookups, DNS checks, sender validation, and metasender creation. These are intended API interactions, not directly malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "API key retrieval from environment variables → API requests using hardcoded IDs → API responses processed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder strings ('$dns_ID', '$sender_ID') suggests the code may be incomplete or template-based. No hardcoded secrets beyond environment variables. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves API keys from environment variables, avoiding hardcoded credentials. The functions are straightforward wrappers around Mailjet API endpoints for DNS and sender validation. The use of placeholders indicates the code may be a template or incomplete; no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, secret theft, or system compromise are present. The code's purpose appears benign, focusing on email configuration validation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, API-driven email validation utility with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only concern is the placeholder IDs, which should be replaced with actual identifiers in production. Overall, it poses no malware threat or security risk based on current analysis.",
