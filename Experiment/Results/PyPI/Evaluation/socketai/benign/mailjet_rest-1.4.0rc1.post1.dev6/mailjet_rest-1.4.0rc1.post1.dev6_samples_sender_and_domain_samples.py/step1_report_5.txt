{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the Mailjet API to perform domain validation, DNS checks, sender validation, and create metasenders for email campaigns.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for API keys (`os.environ['MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC']` and `os.environ['MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE']`) and uses hardcoded placeholders for IDs (`$dns_ID`, `$sender_ID`).",
  "sinks": "Makes HTTP requests to Mailjet API endpoints, potentially transmitting data such as email addresses and DNS information.",
  "flows": "API keys from environment variables are used to authenticate requests. Functions send API requests using hardcoded IDs, then process and output the responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder IDs (`$dns_ID`, `$sender_ID`) suggests the code is designed to operate with specific resource IDs, which could be manipulated. No actual secrets are hardcoded. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code accesses API keys stored securely in environment variables, reducing the risk of hardcoded secret exposure. All API interactions are standard HTTP requests to Mailjet services for email and DNS validation tasks. No suspicious data flows, no code injection, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The placeholders for IDs imply that the script is meant to be parameterized externally, and the functions perform legitimate API calls for email validation workflows. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior in the code. The only notable aspect is reliance on external resource IDs, which are not hardcoded but placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs routine API interactions with Mailjet for email validation and DNS checks. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks evident. The use of environment variables for API keys and placeholders for IDs suggests the code is designed for legitimate operational use, assuming proper external management of resource IDs. Overall, the code appears safe and straightforward.",
