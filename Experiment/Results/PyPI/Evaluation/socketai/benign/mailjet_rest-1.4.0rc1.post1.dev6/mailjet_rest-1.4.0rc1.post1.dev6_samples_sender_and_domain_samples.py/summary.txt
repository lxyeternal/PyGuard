  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client for email validation workflows. It employs environment variables for secrets and uses placeholders for resource IDs, which should be replaced in deployment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor risk score accounts for configuration placeholders but does not indicate a security threat."
