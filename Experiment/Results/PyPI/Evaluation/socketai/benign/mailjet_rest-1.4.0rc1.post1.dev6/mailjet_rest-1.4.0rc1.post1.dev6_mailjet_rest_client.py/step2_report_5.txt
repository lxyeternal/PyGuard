  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues, scores, and conclusions are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured SDK for Mailjet API interaction. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion aligns with the detailed analysis. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** Scores are reasonable and consistent with the report's findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's standard nature, proper handling, and lack of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The analysis confirms no malicious or obfuscated code, and the risk score reflects a low security risk.\n- **Assessment:** Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard, secure nature of the code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) might be due to the mention of debug logging that could expose sensitive data if misused, but this is a common feature and not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are reasonable; no malware or obfuscation is indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard API client, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the detailed analysis, the low risk score is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a well-structured, standard API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** The analysis confirms no malicious or obfuscated code, and the risk score is low.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. This is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to debug logging features that could expose sensitive info if misused, but not malicious.\n\n**Summary:** The reports' assessments are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented SDK for Mailjet with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
