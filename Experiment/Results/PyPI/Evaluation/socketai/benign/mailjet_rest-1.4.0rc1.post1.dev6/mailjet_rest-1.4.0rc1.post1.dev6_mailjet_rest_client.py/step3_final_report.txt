{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python SDK for interacting with the Mailjet API, including configuration, request handling, and endpoint management.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, request responses, environment variables, and input data for API calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Mailjet API endpoints, response parsing, logging outputs, and potential exposure of debug information.",
  "flows": "Source data (config, input) flows into request construction, which then sends data over the network; responses are parsed and logged.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Logging may expose sensitive info if misused, but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK for API interaction, with functions for URL and header building, request execution, and response parsing. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or sabotage behaviors are present. It handles authentication, request types, and error handling appropriately. The logging system includes timestamped file logs and stdout, which could potentially expose sensitive debug info if enabled in production, but this is a common feature. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are found. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1), reflecting typical SDK risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-implemented SDK for Mailjet API interaction. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate and justified.",
