  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a typical API SDK structure, reading from parameters, responses, environment.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, response parsing, logging.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard, legitimate SDK patterns. No malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, no hidden code.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely a genuine SDK, malware score 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 (low, standard SDK risk).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client.\n- **Sinks:** Requests, URL/header building, logging.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Legitimate, well-structured, standard practices. Warnings about disabling SSL verification could be noted, but common.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious signs, malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, standard API client.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, logging.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Typical API client, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, obfuscation, low risk. Scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated are justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API interaction.\n- **Sinks:** Requests, URL/header building, response parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Routine API client, no malicious signs.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk low.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks:** Requests, URL/header building, response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Typical API client, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code being a standard API SDK with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting typical SDK risks, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for Mailjet.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code.\n- The logging and request handling follow standard practices.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, typical SDK risk)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
