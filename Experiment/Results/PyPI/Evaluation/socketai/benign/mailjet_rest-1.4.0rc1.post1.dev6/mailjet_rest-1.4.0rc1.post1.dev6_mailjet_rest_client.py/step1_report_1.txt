{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for interacting with the Mailjet API, including request construction, response parsing, configuration management, and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, request responses, and environment variables. Key sources include API request data, URL parameters, headers, and configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests (requests library), response handling (json parsing), and logging outputs. Data is sent over HTTP and logs are written to stdout or files.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters or environment variables is used to build API requests; requests are sent via requests library; responses are parsed and potentially logged; errors are raised based on response status.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code uses standard libraries and well-known patterns for API interaction. Logging includes file writing with timestamped filenames, which is normal. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements a typical API client with configuration, request building, response parsing, and error handling. It uses safe practices such as parameterized URL construction and exception handling. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system damage, or covert network activity, are present. The logging mechanism writes timestamped logs, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code structure and logic are consistent with a legitimate API SDK.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK for interacting with the Mailjet API. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The code adheres to standard practices for API clients and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
