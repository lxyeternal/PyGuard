{
  "purpose": "The code initializes Mailjet API clients and calls a function to edit contact data, then outputs the result.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables 'MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC' and 'MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE' for API credentials.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data output when printing 'result.json()' or 'result.text'.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Client initialization → edit_contact_data() call → printing results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for API keys is standard; no hardcoded secrets. No unusual code or backdoors observed. No obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves API credentials from environment variables, minimizing hardcoded secrets. It initializes two Client instances with the same credentials but different versions, which is not inherently malicious. It imports and executes a function 'edit_contact_data' from a local sample module, then prints the HTTP status code and JSON response or text. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or code that performs unauthorized system actions. The exception handling for JSON decoding is appropriate. Overall, the code appears to perform legitimate API interactions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code securely manages API credentials, executes a contact data editing function, and outputs results without any signs of malicious behavior. It demonstrates standard API client usage with no evident security risks or malware.",
