{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a client for the Mailjet API using credentials stored in environment variables and calls a contact editing function from an imported sample module, then prints the result.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables 'MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC' and 'MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE'. Importing and executing 'edit_contact_data' from 'samples.contacts_sample'.",
  "sinks": "Printing the JSON response or raw text from the API call result.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are used as trusted input for API authentication; the result of 'edit_contact_data()' is outputted directly to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; no unusual code constructs. Use of environment variables is standard. No malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The script uses environment variables for API credentials, which is a best practice. It imports a sample module and calls a function, then prints the response data. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only external data source is environment variables, which are common for secrets management. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward API client setup and invocation for mailing contact data updates. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code is standard and secure with respect to supply chain concerns.",
