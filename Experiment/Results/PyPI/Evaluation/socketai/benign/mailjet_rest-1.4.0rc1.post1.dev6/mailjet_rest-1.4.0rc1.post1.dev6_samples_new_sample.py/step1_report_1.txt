{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Mailjet API client with environment variables and calls a contact editing function, then outputs the result.",
  "sources": "Reads API keys from environment variables 'MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC' and 'MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE'. Imports 'edit_contact_data' from a sample module.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables for API credentials; prints API response data, potentially exposing sensitive info if output is captured.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Client initialization → API credentials used for authenticated requests → Response data printed to console",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; usage of environment variables is standard. No suspicious or malicious code structures. The imported 'edit_contact_data' could be a concern if malicious, but it appears to be from a sample module.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves API keys from environment variables, avoiding hardcoded secrets. It sets up two Mailjet clients with similar credentials, possibly redundant but not malicious. The main block imports a function to edit contact data and prints the response. No suspicious data flows or obfuscation are evident. Since the actual 'edit_contact_data' function implementation is external, its security cannot be fully assessed here, but assuming standard usage, no malicious behavior is apparent. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network connections outside the API client, or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for interacting with the Mailjet API, with credentials managed via environment variables. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It uses best practices for secret management and does not contain suspicious patterns.",
