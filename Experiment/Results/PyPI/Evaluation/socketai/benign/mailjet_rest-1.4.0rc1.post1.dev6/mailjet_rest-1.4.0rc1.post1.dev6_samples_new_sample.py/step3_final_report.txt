{
  "purpose": "The code initializes Mailjet API clients using environment variables for credentials, calls an external contact editing function, and outputs the response data.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC' and 'MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE' for API keys; external function 'edit_contact_data()' for contact data manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Printing response status code and JSON/text data, which could potentially expose sensitive information if logs are insecure.",
  "flows": "API response received from 'edit_contact_data()' flows through print statements, potentially exposing data; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures; redundant initialization of two similar clients; printing response data could leak sensitive info but is standard during debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code employs best practices by using environment variables for secrets, has straightforward API client setup, and calls an external sample function. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are apparent. The main concern is potential sensitive data exposure via printed output, which is a common risk but not malicious. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal threat. External function security is outside this scope but should be reviewed separately. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with secure coding standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for interacting with the Mailjet API, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.",
