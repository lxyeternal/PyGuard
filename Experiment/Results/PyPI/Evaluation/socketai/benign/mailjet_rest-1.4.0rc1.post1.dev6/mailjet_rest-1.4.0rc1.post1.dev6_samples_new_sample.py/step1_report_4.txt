{
  "purpose": "This script initializes a Mailjet client using API keys from environment variables and calls a function to edit contact data, then outputs the result.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC' and 'MJ_APIKEY_PRIVATE', imported function 'edit_contact_data' from 'samples.contacts_sample'.",
  "sinks": "Printing the status code and JSON/text response; no external data sinks or suspicious output channels identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide API keys to the Client; the 'edit_contact_data' function likely interacts with Mailjet API; output is printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for API keys is standard, but no validation or fallback handling is present. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Mailjet client with credentials sourced from environment variables, which is typical for secure API access. It then imports and executes a contact editing function, printing the results. There is no suspicious logic, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials or secret data are present in the code; reliance on environment variables is standard practice. The code's flow appears straightforward, with no data leakage or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for interacting with the Mailjet API, focusing on updating contact data and displaying the response. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of environment variables for API keys aligns with security best practices, and there are no signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
