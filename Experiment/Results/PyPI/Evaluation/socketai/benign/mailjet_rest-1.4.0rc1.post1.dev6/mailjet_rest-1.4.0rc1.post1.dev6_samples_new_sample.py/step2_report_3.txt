  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Behavior & Logic:**\n   - The code initializes two Mailjet API clients with the same credentials from environment variables.\n   - It imports and calls `edit_contact_data()` from an external sample module.\n   - It prints the response status code and JSON or raw text from the API call.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n   - The code uses environment variables for API keys, which is a best practice.\n   - The external function `edit_contact_data()` is from a sample module; its implementation is not provided here, so its security cannot be fully assessed, but assuming standard usage, it is unlikely malicious.\n\n2. **Security Concerns & Anomalies:**\n   - No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections outside the API, or system compromise.\n   - The printed output could potentially expose sensitive info if logs are insecure, but this is a common pattern in debugging and API interactions.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious actions are evident.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports give a low score (~0.1–0.2). Given the code's straightforward API interaction and proper secret management, this seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Issues & Assumptions:**\n   - The main concern could be the imported `edit_contact_data()` function. If that function were malicious, it could introduce security risks. However, based on the report, it appears to be from a sample module, likely benign.\n   - Printing raw API responses can leak sensitive data if logs are not protected, but this is a standard practice during development or debugging.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard API client setup, with secure secret handling.\n   - No malicious or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low risk, standard API interaction)\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the information, the code appears secure and benign. The only minor concern is the exposure of API responses in logs, but that is a common and manageable risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is secure, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- The risk score could remain at 0.1–0.2.  \n- The malware score should stay at 0.  \n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis of the external `edit_contact_data()` function is available.",
