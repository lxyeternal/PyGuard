  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores; network activity and minimal safeguards justify a malware score of 0.5 in the most suspicious case. Obfuscation is not present. Overall security risk remains low but warrants cautious monitoring. Minor score adjustments enhance accuracy, particularly increasing malware suspicion where network activity is involved."
