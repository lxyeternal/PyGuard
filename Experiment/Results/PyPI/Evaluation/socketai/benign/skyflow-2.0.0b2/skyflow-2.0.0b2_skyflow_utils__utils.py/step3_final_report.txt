  "purpose": "Utility functions for credential management, request construction, response parsing, and error handling within an SDK for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., SKYFLOW_CREDENTIALS), function parameters, request headers, request body, API responses.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, JSON serialization/deserialization, error raising, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Credentials and data flow from environment variables and function inputs into request construction; responses flow into parsing functions; errors are raised or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no backdoors, no malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SDK utility tasks: loading credentials from environment variables, validating API keys, constructing URLs, encoding request data, parsing responses, and handling errors. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The use of environment variables for credentials is typical but should be externally secured. Response parsing and error handling are straightforward and secure. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
