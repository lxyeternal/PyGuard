{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling API requests, responses, and configuration management in the Skyflow SDK, including credential retrieval, URL construction, request preparation, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SKYFLOW_CREDENTIALS), function parameters (e.g., config_level_creds, api_key), user-supplied request data, headers, and body content.",
  "sinks": "Requests being prepared and sent over the network, JSON serialization, error handling/logging, and potential data leakage through error messages.",
  "flows": "Credentials are fetched from environment variables or parameters; URLs are constructed from parameters; request data is serialized and prepared; responses are parsed, errors raised, or data returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for credentials without validation; JSON and data serialization routines are standard; no evident hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Error handling is comprehensive, but no suspicious or hidden code is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to follow standard patterns for API request handling, response parsing, and configuration management. The credential retrieval via environment variables involves no hardcoded secrets; data serialization uses standard libraries; request construction includes input validation. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The only minor concern is the handling of environment variables and JSON data, but these are typical for such SDKs. The functions for parsing responses and handling errors are straightforward, with no hidden or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate SDK utility code for API handling. No signs of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present.",
