  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is standard utility functions for API interaction, with credential retrieval, request construction, response parsing, and error handling. The confidence is high (0.9), and the malware score is 0.\n\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound. No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious network activity are evident.\n\n- **Score evaluation:** The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. The overall security risk is low (0.2), consistent with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the review finds standard patterns, no malicious code, no obfuscation, and no signs of sabotage.\n\n- **Justification:** The functions perform typical SDK utility tasks. No suspicious data flows or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n- **Score evaluation:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The review confirms no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code handles credentials, requests, responses, and errors securely.\n\n- **Justification:** The code's operations are within expected parameters, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Score evaluation:** Malware score of 0 matches the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the review indicates standard SDK utility functions, no malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network activity.\n\n- **Justification:** The code handles environment variables, JSON data, and request/response cycles securely and legitimately.\n\n- **Score evaluation:** Malware score of 0 is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the code is typical for SDK utilities.\n\n- **Justification:** No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n\n- **Score evaluation:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the findings.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the detailed reasoning. The code appears to be standard SDK utility functions with no malicious behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected, which is accurate.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) but generally low, matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, standard SDK utility functions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The scoring across reports is appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** No changes needed. The reports are consistent, and the scores accurately reflect the code's security posture.",
