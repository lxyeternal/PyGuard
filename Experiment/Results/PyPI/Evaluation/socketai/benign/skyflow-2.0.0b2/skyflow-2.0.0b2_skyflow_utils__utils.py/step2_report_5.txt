  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for credentials, request construction, response parsing, and error handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. The reviewer assigns malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed uses environment variables for credentials, constructs requests, parses responses, and handles errors. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores align with the findings.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, standard practices, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions perform typical SDK operations: environment variable loading, URL encoding, response parsing, error handling. No suspicious code or malicious intent detected.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard SDK utility functions with credential retrieval, request construction, response parsing, error handling. No malicious behavior or malware signs. Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code handles data securely, with no backdoors or malicious patterns. Use of environment variables is standard, and response/error handling is straightforward.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for credentials, URL construction, request/response handling. No malicious code or obfuscation. Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical for SDK utilities, with no signs of malicious activity. The lower securityRisk score (0.1) reflects the reliance on environment variables, which is standard but should be externally secured.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard SDK functions for credentials, validation, request/response, error handling. No malicious activity or malware. Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code performs typical operations: environment variable loading, regex validation, JSON parsing, error handling. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's analysis—no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting typical SDK practices with environment variables and request handling—reasonable and consistent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports — **correct**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports — **correct**.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a slightly higher score (e.g., 0.2) is justified, but not higher than 0.3, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation exists in the provided code.",
