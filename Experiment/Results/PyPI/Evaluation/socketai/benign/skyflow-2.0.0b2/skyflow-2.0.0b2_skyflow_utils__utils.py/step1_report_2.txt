  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for handling credentials, constructing requests, parsing API responses, and managing errors for a Python SDK interacting with Skyflow services.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), function parameters (e.g., request bodies, headers, path_params, api_response content), and external inputs such as request objects.",
  "sinks": "Requests prepared with potentially untrusted data, error handling that could process untrusted API responses, and URL encoding functions.",
  "flows": "Input data from environment variables or function arguments flows into request construction, response parsing, and error handling routines without any evident data exfiltration or malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code does not include malicious network connections, data exfiltration, or system tampering. Usage of environment variables for credentials is standard; no evident misuse. Functions like 'http_build_query' and 'r_urlencode' are typical URL encoding utilities. Error handling procedures do not reveal sensitive information beyond typical error messages. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations such as environment variable loading, credential parsing, request construction, response parsing, and error handling. Credential retrieval from environment variables is common and not inherently malicious. URL encoding functions handle data serialization securely. Response parsing routines check for valid JSON and handle errors appropriately, with no indication of data leaks or malicious manipulation. No network activity occurs outside of standard request preparations; no hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are present. Error handling routines process external responses but do not leak sensitive information. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of utility functions used for API interaction, credential management, and response parsing. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The functions operate within expected parameters, with no suspicious data flows, network connections, or obfuscated logic. The use of environment variables for credentials is standard practice. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
