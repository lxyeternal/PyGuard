{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing credentials, validating API keys, constructing and parsing API requests and responses, and handling errors within a Python SDK for a vault service.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SKYFLOW_CREDENTIALS), function arguments (e.g., api_key, config_level_creds), request objects (headers, body, path_params), API responses (content, headers, status code).",
  "sinks": "JSON decoding, request construction (requests.Request), response handling, error raising (SkyflowError), URL construction, credential extraction.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and function arguments provide input data; data is processed or validated; credentials are fetched or validated; requests are constructed and sent; responses are parsed and errors are handled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of json.loads on data that may originate from untrusted sources, although in this context, data seems controlled within the SDK; no suspicious code for backdoors or hidden behaviors; no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication beyond standard API interactions. The code does not perform any unsolicited data transmission, system manipulation, or covert activities.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly performs data processing, request building, response parsing, and error handling functions typical of SDK utility modules. It loads credentials from environment variables, validates API keys with regex, constructs API URLs, serializes and deserializes JSON data, and handles HTTP errors appropriately. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network behaviors are detected. Error handling functions process server responses and raise exceptions accordingly. There are no indications of malware such as data theft, system sabotage, or covert communications. Use of environment variables and JSON handling appears legitimate within an SDK context. Overall, the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical SDK utility module responsible for request/response handling, credential management, and error processing. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform any unauthorized actions or covert operations. It appears safe for use from a security standpoint.",
