  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for credential management, request construction, response parsing, and error handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low).  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard SDK utility code with no signs of malicious behavior. The low security risk score is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no malicious code, no obfuscation, and safe handling of data.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No suspicious patterns or malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** The code performs typical SDK functions—credential retrieval, request building, response parsing—without signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No issues found.  \n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard SDK utility functions, with secure handling of credentials and responses, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low).  \n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate given the absence of suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. The code is utility functions for API interactions, not malware.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, appropriate given the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in handling environment variables and network requests, but nothing malicious.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code snippets are standard SDK utility functions for credential management, request construction, response parsing, and error handling.  \n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.  \n- The use of environment variables for credentials is common practice, provided external security controls are in place.  \n- The response parsing and error handling routines process data securely, with no evident data exfiltration or malicious manipulation.\n\n### **Estimated Final Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**  | **0**       | **0.2** |\n\nThese scores reflect a benign assessment consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
