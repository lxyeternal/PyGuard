  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for Skyflow errors with logging capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method: message, http_code, request_id, grpc_code, http_status, details",
  "sinks": "log_error function call with error details, which may log to external systems or files",
  "flows": "Parameters received -> log_error is called with these parameters -> exception initialized with message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard exception class with logging. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class SkyflowError that captures various error details and logs them via log_error. It uses parameters provided during initialization and defaults http_status if not specified. The log_error function is invoked with detailed error info, which is typical for error handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling. The class solely manages exception information and logging.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard custom exception class with logging functionality, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
