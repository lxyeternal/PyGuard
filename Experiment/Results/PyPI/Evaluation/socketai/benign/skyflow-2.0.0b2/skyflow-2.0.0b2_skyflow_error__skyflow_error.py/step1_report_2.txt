  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for Skyflow errors, including logging functionality.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ method: message, http_code, request_id, grpc_code, http_status, details.",
  "targets": "log_error function call which may send logs to an external system or store logs.",
  "flows": "Parameters are passed into the class constructor; log_error is called with these parameters, potentially transmitting or storing error details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. Usage of external logger is typical but warrants checking the log_error implementation for malicious actions, which is outside this code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class that initializes various error-related attributes. It calls log_error with error details, which could potentially send sensitive data externally. The class itself contains no malicious behavior or malicious code. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present. The overall structure appears standard for error handling with logging. However, the security risk depends on the implementation of log_error, which is external. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward custom exception class with logging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The only consideration is ensuring the external log_error function does not send sensitive data maliciously. Overall, it appears safe.",
