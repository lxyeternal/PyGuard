  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code defines a straightforward custom exception class that logs error details. No malicious behavior or suspicious code is observed. The logging is standard, and parameters are typical for error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Note:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the external `log_error`. The report correctly notes that maliciousness depends on `log_error` implementation, which is outside this snippet.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Note:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion. The code is standard error handling with logging, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 appropriate.\n- **Note:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, standard exception class with logging. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 suitable.\n- **Note:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard pattern, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for error handling and logging.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting standard error handling with minimal security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical custom exception class that logs error details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities within this snippet.\n- The only potential concern is the external `log_error` function, which could theoretically be malicious, but that cannot be determined from this code alone. Given the context, the risk remains very low.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (as already assigned), since it is standard code with minimal security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are reasonable and justified based on the code provided. No changes needed.",
