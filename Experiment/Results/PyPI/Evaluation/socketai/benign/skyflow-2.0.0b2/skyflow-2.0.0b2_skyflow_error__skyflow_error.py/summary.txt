  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom exception class with logging, showing no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. The main consideration is ensuring that log_error handles data securely, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident."
