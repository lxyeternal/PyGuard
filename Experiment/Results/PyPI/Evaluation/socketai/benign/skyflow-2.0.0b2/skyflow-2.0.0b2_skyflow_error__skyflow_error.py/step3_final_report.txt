  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard error class with logging",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class SkyflowError that captures error details and logs them via an external log_error function. It initializes attributes like message, http_code, request_id, grpc_code, http_status, and details. The call to super().__init__() does not pass the message, which is a minor design note but not a security concern. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The security implications depend on the external log_error implementation, which is outside this snippet. The code is typical for error handling with logging, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom exception class with logging, showing no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate. The main consideration is ensuring that log_error handles data securely, but within this code, no malicious activity is evident.",
