  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it defines a custom exception class that logs error details.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None observed. The code is straightforward.\n   - **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which aligns with no malicious behavior. Security risk is 0.1, which seems reasonable given it's just error handling and logging.\n   - **Justification:** The code does not perform any malicious activity. The logging is external, but no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n   - **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it defines a custom exception with logging.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.\n   - **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0.2, which is reasonable considering the potential for logs to contain sensitive data.\n   - **Justification:** The code itself is safe; concern about external logging implementation remains, but not within this snippet.\n   - **Conclusion:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code matches; it's a standard exception class with logging.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious logic.\n   - **Scores:** Malware score is 0, aligning with the code's behavior.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious behavior; the external log function's behavior isn't known but isn't suspicious here.\n   - **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code matches; standard custom exception with logging.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies.\n   - **Scores:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the code.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious intent; the code is typical for error handling.\n   - **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code matches; standard exception class with logging.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None observed.\n   - **Scores:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, which are appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard custom exception class with logging.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct; the code does not contain malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of an error class with logging.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, typical error handling with logging)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe and standard.",
