  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for Skyflow API errors, including logging of error details.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ (message, http_code, request_id, grpc_code, http_status, details)",
  "sinks": "log_error function call, which logs error details",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters (sources) pass to log_error (sink) for logging purposes",
  "anomalies": "None observed; the code appears straightforward in defining an exception class with logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception SkyflowError that captures various error details and logs them via log_error. It uses provided parameters and defaults for http_status. No data is read from external or untrusted sources directly; input parameters are typical exception attributes. The logging function is invoked with all relevant error info, but without evidence of malicious behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious data handling is detected. Overall, it appears as standard exception handling with logging.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines an error class that logs its details; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It appears to be standard, secure error handling code.",
