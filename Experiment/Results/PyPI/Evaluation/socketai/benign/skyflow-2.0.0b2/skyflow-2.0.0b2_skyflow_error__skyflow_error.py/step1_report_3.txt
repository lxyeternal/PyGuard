  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Skyflow-related errors with logging.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Skyflow utility modules; usage of input parameters in the __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "Calling log_error with error details, which may log sensitive information depending on implementation.",
  "flows": "Initialization of SkyflowError with message and error details → log_error is called with these details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code present. No dynamic execution or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class that initializes with error details and logs the error. The log_error function is called with potentially sensitive error information, but without knowing its implementation, it's uncertain whether sensitive data might be exposed. The class itself is standard and does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or backdoors are present. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward error handling logic with logging.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a structured way to handle and log errors related to Skyflow operations. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no significant security risk based on the provided snippet.",
