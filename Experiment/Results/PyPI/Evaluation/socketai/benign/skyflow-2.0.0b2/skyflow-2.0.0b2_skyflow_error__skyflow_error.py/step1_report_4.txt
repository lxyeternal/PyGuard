  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Skyflow-related errors with logging.",
  "sources": "Imports from skyflow.utils and skyflow.utils.logger, class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "Logging function log_error, assignment of exception attributes.",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters -> attribute assignments -> log_error call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual control flow observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'SkyflowError' that initializes with various error-related parameters. It logs the error details via log_error and sets attributes accordingly. The implementation appears standard for custom exception handling with integrated logging. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. The imported modules seem to be for utility functions and logging, which are typical for such classes. The super().__init__() is called without arguments, which is acceptable but may omit error message propagation, though this is not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears to serve as an error handling utility without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom exception class for error handling and logging within the Skyflow SDK. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as intended for error management.",
