{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing URLs to obtain base URLs and for formatting scope lists into a string with role prefixes.",
  "sources": "The get_base_url function reads input URLs; the format_scope function reads a list of scopes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input URL from get_base_url is parsed but not used further; scope list from format_scope is formatted but not used in sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. No unusual code patterns or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions are simple utility functions: get_base_url extracts the scheme and netloc from a URL, which is standard parsing; format_scope converts a list of scope strings into a formatted string. There are no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no external communications. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears benign and intended for URL processing and scope formatting, common in authentication/authorization contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs URL parsing and scope formatting without any suspicious behavior. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
