  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting base URL from a given URL and formatting a list of scopes into a string with role prefixes.",
  "sources": "Input URL parameter in get_base_url, scopes list in format_scope",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform parsing and string formatting without external or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Input URL flows through urlparse to produce base URL; scopes list flows through join to produce formatted string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple utility functions: get_base_url parses a URL and returns its scheme and netloc; format_scope joins a list of scope strings with a 'role:' prefix. Both functions perform basic string and URL parsing operations with no external communication, code execution, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is standard, safe, and free of vulnerabilities or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary; the code is safe and well-understood.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or modifications are needed.",
