  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL parsing and scope formatting, likely part of a larger application dealing with URL manipulation and role-based scope formatting.",
  "sources": "The URL parameter in get_base_url(), scopes parameter in format_scope()",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output processed URL and scope strings; no untrusted data output or external communication observed",
  "flows": "Input URL is parsed to extract base URL; input scopes list is formatted into a string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: get_base_url() parses a given URL to extract its scheme and network location, returning the base URL; format_scope() formats a list of scope strings into a space-separated string with role prefixes, or returns None if input is empty. Both functions perform straightforward string and data manipulation without external data leakage, network communication, or insecure operations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears benign and utility-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple utility functions for URL parsing and scope formatting with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and does not perform any harmful operations.",
