  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to parse URLs and format scope strings for roles.",
  "sources": "Input URL string in get_base_url function, input scopes list in format_scope function.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; functions return processed data without external outputs or side effects.",
  "flows": "Input URL flows through urlparse to produce base URL; input scopes list is transformed into formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; functions perform straightforward processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: get_base_url parses a URL to extract scheme and netloc, returning the base URL; format_scope joins list items into a space-separated string with role prefix. Both functions use standard library methods and simple string manipulation without external side effects or data leaks. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The logic is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic URL parsing and string formatting with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
