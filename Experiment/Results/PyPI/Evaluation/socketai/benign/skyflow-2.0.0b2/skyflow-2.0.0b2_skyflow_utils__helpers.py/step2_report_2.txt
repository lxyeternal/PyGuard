  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists of straightforward utility functions: `get_base_url` and `format_scope`.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- No data leaks, external communications, or dangerous data handling are observed.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, indicating benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the original code provided.\n- No issues are present in the code snippets.\n- The functions are simple, well-understood, and do not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and correct.\n- The analysis correctly identifies the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n- The functions do not process untrusted data in a dangerous way; they are utility functions.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the reports and code, I agree with the assigned scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code is standard utility code, often used in larger applications.\n- No hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The functions do not perform any dangerous operations like code execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action is needed. The code is clean and secure as presented.",
