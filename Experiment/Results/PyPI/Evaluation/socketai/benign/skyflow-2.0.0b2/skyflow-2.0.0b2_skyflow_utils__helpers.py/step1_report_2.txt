{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL parsing and formatting scopes, likely used for access control or configuration.",
  "sources": "The function get_base_url reads input from the parameter 'url'. The function format_scope reads input from the parameter 'scopes'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources or perform operations that are typical sinks for untrusted data (e.g., network, file, eval).",
  "flows": "Input URL from get_base_url flows through urlparse to produce a sanitized base URL. Input scopes in format_scope are joined into a string. No data flows to external sinks or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two simple functions: one parses a URL to extract the base URL components; the other formats a list of scopes into a string with 'role:' prefix. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious network activities. Both functions operate on input parameters without side effects or external calls. The code appears benign and standard for URL handling and scope formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and free from obfuscation or malware.",
