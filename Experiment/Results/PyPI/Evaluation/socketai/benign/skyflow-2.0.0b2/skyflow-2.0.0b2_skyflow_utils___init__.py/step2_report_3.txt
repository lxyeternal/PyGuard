  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the import code snippet, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\nThe provided code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, including enums, messages, version info, helpers, and utilities. There is no executable logic, data processing, or network communication visible. The functions imported suggest they are used for credential management, request construction, response parsing, validation, and encoding, typical for an SDK setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code is just import statements with no malicious activity. The confidence is high (1), and malware score is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms the code is standard import statements with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct, with high confidence and malware score 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, only import statements with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still accurate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Recognizes that functions like `get_credentials`, `get_vault_url`, etc., could handle sensitive data but notes that the code is only import statements, so no immediate risk.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious activity inferred from import statements alone.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizes that these are setup imports with no signs of malicious intent. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but justified.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly state that the code is just import statements with no malicious or security issues visible.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \n  No significant errors. The reports appropriately refrain from assuming malicious activity solely based on import statements.\n\n- **Scores and justifications:**  \n  All malware scores are 0, which is consistent with the code snippet. Security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern given the nature of the code.\n\n- **Higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Since the code only contains imports, and no runtime or network activity, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  No reports make unwarranted assumptions. They acknowledge that some functions could handle sensitive data but clarify that the code snippet itself does not perform such operations.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the entire analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code snippet is benign, consisting solely of import statements necessary for the SDK's operation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward import statements)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, reflecting minimal setup-related risk)\n\n**Overall:** The code is standard SDK setup code with no security concerns.",
