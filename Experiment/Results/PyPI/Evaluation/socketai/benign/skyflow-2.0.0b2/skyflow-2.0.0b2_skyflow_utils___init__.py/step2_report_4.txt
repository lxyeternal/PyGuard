  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and determine the appropriate scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is just import statements, no runtime logic or suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, malware, or security risks detected.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (slightly conservative but acceptable)\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK setup code.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard import statements with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malware.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (reasonable)\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—import statements, no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malware.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (reasonable)\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Import statements, functions that handle sensitive data are imported but not executed here.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious activity; standard SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (slightly cautious but acceptable)\n- **Conclusion:** No immediate concerns.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, only import statements.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (acceptable)\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements with no runtime logic or network activity.\n- **Malware Scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, correctly indicating the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly conservative at 0.1, which is reasonable given the context—import statements alone are low risk but could, in theory, be part of a malicious setup if malicious modules are imported. However, these are internal modules, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0 for all reports. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0.1 for a conservative approach, but could be lowered to 0 if desired, given the lack of runtime behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\nConsidering all reports and the nature of the code:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0 if further context suggests this is purely setup code)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
