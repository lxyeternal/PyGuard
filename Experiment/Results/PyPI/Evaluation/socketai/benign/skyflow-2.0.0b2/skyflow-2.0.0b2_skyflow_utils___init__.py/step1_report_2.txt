{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and functions related to utils, enums, messages, version info, and helper functions for a SDK, likely to facilitate interactions with a service such as Skyflow.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from internal relative paths, notably 'utils', '_skyflow_messages', '_version', '_helpers', and '_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data is processed or outputted in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is apparent in the provided import statements; they only set up dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hardcoded secrets are evident in the import statements; no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely comprised of import statements to include modules and functions necessary for the SDK's operation. No runtime code, data processing, or external network interactions are present at this stage. The imports seem standard and do not indicate malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, the code appears to be standard import statements setting up dependencies for a Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks within these imports. The snippet is benign and likely part of a larger, secure codebase.",
