{
  "purpose": "This code contains only import statements from internal modules, with no executable logic or data handling, serving as setup for an SDK or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules such as enums, messages, version info, helpers, and utils.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code is purely import declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions and constants related to credentials, messaging, versioning, and utilities. There is no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. The imported functions are typical for SDK setup and do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of code execution, data handling, or network communication means there are no security risks or malicious behaviors. The import statements are standard and do not involve obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The malware score is therefore 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1) due to the potential for these modules to handle sensitive data internally, but no actual risk is evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of import statements necessary for SDK initialization. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
