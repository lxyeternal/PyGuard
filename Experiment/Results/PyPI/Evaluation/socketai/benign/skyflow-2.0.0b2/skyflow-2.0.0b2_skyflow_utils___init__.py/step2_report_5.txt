  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the scores, and the underlying logic.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely import statements, with no runtime logic, data flow, or external network activity visible.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both are correctly scored as 0, given the benign nature.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 seems reasonable, as import statements alone are low risk but could, in some cases, be part of a malicious package if combined with other malicious code elsewhere.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high confidence), appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes only import statements with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, which aligns with the content.\n- **Risk:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, only import statements, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, matching the code.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower at 0.9, perhaps reflecting a slightly less certain stance, but still reasonable.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The report notes that some imported functions handle sensitive data, but the code snippet only contains imports, not execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, obfuscated 0, consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 is acceptable, considering the functions could process sensitive data later, but nothing malicious is evident here.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard import statements with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, matching the code.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 is acceptable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely import statements with no malicious or obfuscated code present.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are all appropriately set at 0.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code snippet.\n- Confidence levels are high, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk score:** Given the import-only nature, a score around 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable, but not higher.\n- **Adjusted scores:** No significant changes needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Summary:** The code snippet is a standard import section of an SDK or library, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks evident. The current scores and assessments are appropriate.",
