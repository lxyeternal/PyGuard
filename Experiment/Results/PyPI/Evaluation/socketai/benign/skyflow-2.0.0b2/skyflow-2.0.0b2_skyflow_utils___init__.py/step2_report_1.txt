  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is just import statements; no runtime logic or suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no anomalies, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies this as benign setup code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard import statements with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate, no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, import statements only, no runtime logic.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9 — consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies this as benign setup code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Imports modules/functions that handle sensitive data, but only as setup.\n- **Findings:** No actual data handling or execution here; functions may process sensitive info later.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Since only import statements are present, no immediate risk. The slight securityRisk score accounts for the functions' potential to handle sensitive data later, but as per this snippet, no actual risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; import statements for modules/functions related to credentials, messages, and utils.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies this as standard setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Evaluation:\n\n- All reports agree these are import statements with no malicious activity.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of suspicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1), reflecting minimal risk at this stage, which is appropriate given the code is only importing modules.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is justified.\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mostly due to the functions that could handle sensitive data, but no actual risky operations are present in this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:** This code fragment is a standard setup for an SDK, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nI would keep the malware score at **0**, obfuscated at **0**, and the overall risk at **0.1**. The reports are aligned with this assessment.",
