{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python SDK or library, importing various utility modules, enums, messages, version info, and helper functions likely used for interacting with an API or service related to Skyflow.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules, such as ..utils.enums, ._skyflow_messages, ._version, ._helpers, and ._utils.",
  "sinks": "None present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external network operations are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicit in the given code; it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The imported functions and enums are standard for SDK modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely import statements, indicating setup for a larger module. No runtime logic, input handling, or network communication is visible. The imported functions seem related to credential handling, request construction, response parsing, and validation, which are typical in secure SDK design. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a typical part of an SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as an import section setting up dependencies for further operations in the larger module.",
