  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable (`SDK_VERSION = '2.0.0b2'`).\n   - The original code snippet confirms this. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is minimal, benign, and contains no malicious activity.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, which is justified by the code's simplicity.\n   - No risk of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n   - No need to challenge this.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the presence of a beta version indicator ('b2') but correctly interpret it as a pre-release marker, not malicious.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the current scores. However, I would note that the presence of a beta version indicator ('b2') might suggest ongoing development, which could be a minor concern in some contexts, but not a security risk per se.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0      | No malicious behavior present                                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0      | Code is clear, straightforward, no obfuscation             |\n| Security Risk    | 0      | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors detected             |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet is benign, with no security or malicious concerns.",
