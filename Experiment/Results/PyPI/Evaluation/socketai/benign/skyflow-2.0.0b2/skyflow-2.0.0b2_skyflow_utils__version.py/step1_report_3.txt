  "sources": "Assignment statement setting SDK_VERSION from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a version string with a 'b' suffix indicating a beta release, which may be less stable, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple variable assignment setting SDK_VERSION to a specific version string. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The presence of a beta version suffix ('b2') suggests this may be a pre-release, but it does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward assignment of a version string. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
