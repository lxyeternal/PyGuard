  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**  \n   All reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable (`SDK_VERSION = '2.0.0b2'`). There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows beyond this assignment. The code snippets are minimal and consistent across reports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and simple. They note the presence of a pre-release version indicator ('b2') but correctly interpret it as a development or testing version, not malicious. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity is suggested or present.  \n   - **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports consistently indicate no malicious intent, no vulnerabilities, and no obfuscation, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The presence of the 'b2' beta indicator does not imply malicious activity; it is standard for pre-release versions. No suspicious patterns or behaviors are observed.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard version assignment statement with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a simple, benign assignment of a version string, including a pre-release indicator.  \n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.  \n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
