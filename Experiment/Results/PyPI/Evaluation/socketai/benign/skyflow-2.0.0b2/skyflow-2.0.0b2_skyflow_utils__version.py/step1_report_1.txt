  "sinks": "No data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths since the code only assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a beta indicator ('b2') could suggest pre-release, but not suspicious by itself. No other unusual code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version variable to a string indicating version 2.0.0 beta 2. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing. No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The snippet is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard version declaration.",
