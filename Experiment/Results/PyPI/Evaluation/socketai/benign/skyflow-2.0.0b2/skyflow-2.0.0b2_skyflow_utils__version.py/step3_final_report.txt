{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the SDK_VERSION variable, indicating the version of the SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assigned to SDK_VERSION; no external inputs or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a pre-release suffix ('b2') in the version string, which is typical in development versions but not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string, including a beta indicator. No inputs, outputs, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. The presence of 'b2' indicates a pre-release version, which is common and not inherently risky. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
