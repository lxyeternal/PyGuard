  "purpose": "Defines the SDK version as a string identifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string assigned to SDK_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no additional operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a potentially non-stable beta version indicator ('b2') in the version string, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string representing the SDK version. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions. The version string indicates a beta release but contains no malicious indicators or suspicious behavior. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version assignment statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The presence of a beta version identifier is normal for pre-release software and does not pose security concerns.",
