  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**1. Confirm if issues are present in the code:**\n- The original code is a straightforward assignment: `SDK_VERSION = '2.0.0b2'`.\n- All reports agree that there are no inputs, outputs, or data flows beyond this assignment.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is present in the code.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the use of a pre-release version string ('b2') is normal in development cycles and not suspicious.\n- No logical errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n**3. Review the scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Security risk scores are 0, matching the analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which seems reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n**4. Justify any risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The presence of a 'b2' pre-release tag does not constitute a security risk by itself.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- There is no indication of malicious behavior or code.\n\n**6. Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- All assessments correctly dismiss the possibility of vulnerabilities or malicious intent based solely on this code snippet.\n- No assumptions are made that could be challenged; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The presence of a 'b2' suffix indicates a pre-release version, which is common in development but not inherently risky.\n- The code's simplicity and lack of data flow or external interactions support a benign classification.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence to suggest any security concern beyond normal development practices.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep the scores as they are: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No further action needed for this code snippet.",
