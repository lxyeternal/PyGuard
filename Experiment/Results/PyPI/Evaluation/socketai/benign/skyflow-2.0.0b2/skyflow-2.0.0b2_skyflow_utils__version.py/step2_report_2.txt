  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the code in the original snippet:**\n   - The original code is simply: `SDK_VERSION = '2.0.0b2'`\n   - All reports describe the same code: a straightforward assignment of a version string, including a beta indicator.\n\n2. **Are the issues present?**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a static string to a variable.\n   - No external inputs, data flows, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The presence of a pre-release ('b2') suffix is common in development cycles, not suspicious.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, untrusted sources, or malicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, this is appropriate.\n   - The only potential concern could be the pre-release version indicator, but it does not constitute a security risk.\n\n6. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied by the code.\n\n7. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they recognize that the code is benign and standard.\n\n8. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n**Summary and final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The presence of a beta indicator ('b2') is typical in development and does not imply security issues.\n- All reports are accurate and reasonable in their scoring and reasoning.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, and the reports are accurate. No adjustments are necessary.",
