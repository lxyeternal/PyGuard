{
  "purpose": "Importing specific classes or constants (LogLevel, Env) from a local utils module and a Skyflow class from a client module, likely for configuration and client operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .utils and .client.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling occurring in these lines; potential data flows depend on usage within the imported classes and modules.",
  "flows": "Not applicable at this import stage; source-to-sink flows depend on subsequent code execution involving these imported components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this snippet; imports appear standard for modular Python code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import statements, referencing relative modules within a package. No execution or data handling occurs here, so no security concerns are immediately apparent. The classes LogLevel, Env, and Skyflow suggest configuration and client management functionality, which could be misused if the implementations are malicious, but no such behavior is evident from import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of import statements, which are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior or security risks on their own. No anomalies or malware indications are present at this stage.",
