  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules (.utils and .client).\n   - No execution, data handling, or external input/output is visible.\n   - The code snippets are minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that import statements alone do not pose security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all snippets are just import statements with no malicious behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would be unjustified unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts.\n   - They recognize that import statements alone do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable based on the provided code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code snippets are standard import statements from internal modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Without additional context or execution code, these imports are benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The scores are appropriate given the minimal and standard nature of the code. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
