  "purpose": "Importing classes LogLevel and Env from a local utils module, and the Skyflow class from a client module, likely for configuration and API interaction.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.utils and .client)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling evident in the provided snippet",
  "flows": "No execution flow involving untrusted data or external inputs is visible in this minimal code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious import patterns detected",
  "analysis": "This code fragment solely consists of import statements from local modules, which is standard practice for modular Python code. No data processing, input handling, or untrusted data flows are present. As it is only a fragment, it does not show any potential malicious behavior or security issues beyond normal code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this minimal snippet.",
