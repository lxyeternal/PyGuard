{
  "purpose": "Importing specific classes LogLevel and Env from a local utils module, and the Skyflow class from a client module, likely for configuring or initializing a system or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.utils and .client). No external input reading or data sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, untrusted data flows, or suspicious operations are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is standard practice in modular Python code. There are no embedded data reads, external communications, or complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic execution. The structure and syntax are typical and do not indicate obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, performing standard module imports without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where these classes are used for legitimate purposes.",
