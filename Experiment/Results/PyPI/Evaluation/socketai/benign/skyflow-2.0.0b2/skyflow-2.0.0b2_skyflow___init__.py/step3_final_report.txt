{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and constants from local modules within a package, likely for configuration and client initialization purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.utils' and '.client' modules, which may read internal configuration or class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules; no data flow or execution occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with no executable logic, data handling, or external communication. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the minimal and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only standard import statements with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
