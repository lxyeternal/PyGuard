  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules (.utils and .client).\n   - No execution, data handling, or external input/output is present in these snippets.\n   - The original code is straightforward and standard for modular Python applications.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware and securityRisk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable since the analysis is based on minimal code.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is only import statements with no execution or data flow, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher risk scores here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the limited scope and benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable ratings are apparent.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code snippets are benign import statements with no security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, standard nature of the code. Without additional context or further code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
