  "purpose": "Validation of configuration objects, request data, and parameters for Skyflow SDK operations to ensure correctness and security.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries, request objects, environment variables, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Errors logged via logger, exceptions raised (SkyflowError), no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources into validation functions, errors are logged or exceptions raised, no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive validation checks, including type validation, presence checks, logical consistency, and token expiration validation. It employs standard practices for error handling and logging. No external calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. The detailed error messages could potentially leak internal details if logs are exposed, but this is typical for validation routines. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured validation module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the low risk associated with detailed error messages that could reveal internal logic if logs are not secured. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
