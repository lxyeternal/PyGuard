{
  "purpose": "The code provides various validation functions for different configurations and requests related to the Skyflow SDK, ensuring proper data types, required fields, and logical consistency.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data (dictionaries, strings, lists), request data (objects with attributes), and input parameters for validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as system commands, network calls, or file writes are present; the code only raises exceptions and logs errors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources into validation checks; on failure, errors are raised; no data is transmitted or stored elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments detected; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive validation of configurations and requests, including type checks, presence of required fields, value constraints, and logical consistency. All functions utilize standard validation patterns, error handling, and logging. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The functions raise exceptions on invalid input, but do not execute external commands or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code features are present. The logic is straightforward and focused on data validation, with no suspicious flow or anomalous patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be purely for validation purposes with no malicious intent. It performs necessary checks to ensure correct usage of the SDK's functions. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this module. Overall, it is safe, and the security risk score is low.",
