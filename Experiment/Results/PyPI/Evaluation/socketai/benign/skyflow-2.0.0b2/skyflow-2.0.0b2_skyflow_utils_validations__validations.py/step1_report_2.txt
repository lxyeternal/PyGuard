{
  "purpose": "This code provides validation functions for different configuration and request objects related to the Skyflow SDK, ensuring proper data integrity and security checks before further processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as config, credentials, request objects, and query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Errors and logs generated during validation, raising exceptions or logging errors; no data leaks or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated via a series of checks; no external or untrusted data flows into unsafe operations. Validation functions ensure correctness and integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious side-effects observed. Use of external libraries appears standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically validates configurations, credentials, and request parameters, with detailed error handling and logging. It performs checks for required fields, data types, value constraints, and logical consistency. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Validation routines focus on correctness and security best practices, including expiration checks for tokens. No suspicious external calls or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive validation suite designed to enforce data correctness and security standards for the SDK's operations. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. The routines are straightforward, with no indicators of supply chain attack or hidden malware. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured.",
