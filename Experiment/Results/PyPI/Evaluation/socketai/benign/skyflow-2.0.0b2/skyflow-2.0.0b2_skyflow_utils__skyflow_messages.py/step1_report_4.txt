{
  "purpose": "This code defines various constant messages, error codes, and enums used for logging, validation, and error handling within a Python SDK for Skyflow.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, enum class definitions, and imported version information.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process external untrusted data or perform network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident; primarily static definitions and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic execution. The code contains a consistent pattern of formatted error messages and info logs.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a structured repository of message templates, error codes, and status indicators for the SDK. It imports a version identifier, which is used to prefix error and info messages. No code execution, data parsing, or external data handling occurs here. All messages are static or formatted strings, with no suspicious dynamic content or obfuscation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. The structure appears standard for SDK logging and error management. No signs of sabotage or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured collection of message definitions and enums used for error handling and logging within the SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain threats. The code's purpose is to standardize message outputs and error codes, with no indications of harmful intent.",
