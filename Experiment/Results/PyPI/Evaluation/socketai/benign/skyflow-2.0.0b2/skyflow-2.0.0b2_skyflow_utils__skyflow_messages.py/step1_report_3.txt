{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of enumerations containing constants for messages, error codes, info logs, and warnings used throughout the Skyflow Python SDK for error handling, logging, and validation messaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string messages, enum values, and imported constants such as SDK_VERSION and potentially external version files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data are present. All data are static string messages stored in enums.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining message templates and constants. No dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no signs of hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data. It does not perform any input/output, network operations, or dynamic execution. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured collection of static message templates categorized into various enums for error messages, info logs, and warnings used for logging and error handling within the SDK. It imports a version constant, but this is standard practice for version tracking. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be purely declarative, intended for maintaining standardized messages across the SDK. There are no input sources or output sinks, nor any code that could be exploited for supply chain attacks or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a well-structured, static collection of message templates and constants for use within the SDK. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It appears to be standard SDK messaging infrastructure with no malicious behavior.",
