  "purpose": "Static definitions of error codes, message templates, info logs, warnings, and enums for SDK error handling and logging.",
  "sources": "Constants, enums, and string templates used for error messages, info logs, and warnings within the SDK.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or handle untrusted input or external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static message definitions are used solely for internal SDK messaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of static constants, enums, and string templates for error handling, info logs, and warnings. It imports SDK_VERSION for message prefixing but does not include any dynamic code, data processing, secrets, or obfuscated logic. No external data handling or executable code is present. The structure is typical for SDK message management modules, and no malicious or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static resource module for structured messaging within the SDK. It poses no security or malware threat, and the scores assigned in the original reports are appropriate. The code's static nature and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
