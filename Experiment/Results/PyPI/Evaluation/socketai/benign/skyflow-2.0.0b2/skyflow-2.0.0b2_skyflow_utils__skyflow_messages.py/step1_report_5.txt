{
  "purpose": "Defines structured and standardized error, info, and warning messages, as well as enumerations for error codes, HTTP statuses, and interface actions for the Skyflow Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Constants and enum definitions that provide message templates, error codes, and action labels. No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions that handle untrusted input; no untrusted data flows or output generation beyond static message definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code strictly defines static message templates and enums without dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden functionalities observed. The code structure is consistent with a message constants module.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises static definitions of messages, error codes, and enums for use throughout the SDK. It uses string templates for error messages and categorizes messages into nested classes. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to serve as a centralized message repository. There are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity, and no sensitive data or secrets are embedded.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, well-structured set of constants and enumerations used for logging, error reporting, and interface definitions within the SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
