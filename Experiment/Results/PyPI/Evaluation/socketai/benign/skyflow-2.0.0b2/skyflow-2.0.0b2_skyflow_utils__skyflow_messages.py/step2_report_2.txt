  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely static, defining constants, error codes, and message templates.\n   - No functions, dynamic data processing, external data handling, or obfuscated logic are present.\n   - The code does not include any hardcoded secrets, credentials, tokens, or backdoors.\n   - The imported `SDK_VERSION` is used only for message prefixing, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is static and benign.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each report:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 1, with confidence levels of 1. They are reasonable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n   - Since the code is purely static constants and enums, a malware score higher than 0 is unwarranted.\n   - The obfuscated score is correctly 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is appropriately low, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - The highest risk here is the potential for misclassification, but given the static nature and lack of executable code, the risk remains minimal.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this with very low or zero scores.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims in the reports rely on assumptions; they all logically deduce the benign nature of the code based on its static and declarative structure.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the code:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's static, non-executable, and non-malicious nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, static collection of message templates and enums for SDK error handling and logging. It poses no security or malware threat.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nNo changes needed to the scores or the report summaries. They are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present                       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected            |\n| Security Risk     | 0                 | Static constants with no external or dynamic data handling |\n\nThis detailed review confirms the code's benign nature and aligns with the existing reports' conclusions.",
