{
  "purpose": "This code defines a collection of enumerations for messages, error codes, and statuses used within the Skyflow Python SDK, primarily for logging, error reporting, and validation messaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants from imported modules (e.g., SDK_VERSION), and defines static string messages and enums. No external input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or pass data to sinks such as network, file, or environment variables. It solely defines message templates and enums.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing logic involving untrusted data. The code is static definitions for messaging.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be static, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated logic, or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets such as credentials, tokens, or keys are present. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of static class and enum definitions used for structured messaging in the SDK. It references an imported version variable but does not utilize it in a malicious context. No dynamic or external data processing, network operations, or credential handling is present. The messages are comprehensive but do not contain any suspicious or hidden code. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign collection of message constants.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign part of the SDK's messaging system, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It strictly defines static message templates for internal use.",
