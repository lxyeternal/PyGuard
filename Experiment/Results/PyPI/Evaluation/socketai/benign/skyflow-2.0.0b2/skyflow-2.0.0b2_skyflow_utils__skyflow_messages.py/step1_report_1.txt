{
  "purpose": "Defines a structured collection of constant messages, error codes, and enums for logging, error handling, and interface specifications within the Skyflow Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum and a local _version module; defines string constants, enums for error codes, messages, info logs, error logs, interface actions, HTTP status, and warnings.",
  "sinks": "String formatting templates for error messages and info logs, used throughout the SDK for reporting errors and statuses.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines static constants and enums used for messaging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. The code purely defines constants and enums for structured messaging.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of enum and string constant definitions for SDK messaging, including error codes, error messages, info logs, and warnings. There are no functions, input processing, or dynamic behaviors that could introduce malicious activity. The message templates and enums are straightforward, with no embedded code execution or external data handling. There is also no obfuscated or malicious-looking code. Overall, the code is a benign, static configuration of messages for SDK operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard static resource module for error and log messaging, with no malicious intent or security risks present. It serves as a centralized message repository for the SDK and does not contain any executable or suspicious behavior.",
