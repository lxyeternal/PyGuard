{
  "purpose": "Import the SkyflowError class from a local module _skyflow_error",
  "sources": "The import statement reads a module named _skyflow_error within the same package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leak points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this is a straightforward import statement",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, which is a common pattern for error handling. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The module name '_skyflow_error' suggests it is an internal module, not an external or suspicious source. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import of an error class from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
