{
  "purpose": "Import a class named SkyflowError from a local module _skyflow_error, likely for error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module _skyflow_error during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The only flow is importing the class from the local module, with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a class from a local module, which is a standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data flows, no suspicious code constructs, and no obfuscated code. The import indicates error handling functionality related to Skyflow, presumably part of a larger project. The simplicity of this snippet suggests it's not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply imports a class for error handling, with no suspicious behavior.",
