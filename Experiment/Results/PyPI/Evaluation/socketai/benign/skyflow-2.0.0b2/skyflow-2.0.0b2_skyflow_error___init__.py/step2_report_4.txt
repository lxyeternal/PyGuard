  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   The code is:\n   ```python\n   from ._skyflow_error import SkyflowError\n   ```\n   This is a straightforward import statement, importing a class `SkyflowError` from a local module `_skyflow_error`. There are no other code constructs, data flows, or execution logic present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - **Malicious behavior:** No. The code simply imports a class; no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious activity.\n   - **Vulnerabilities:** No. The import is from a local module, and there's no handling of untrusted data or external communication.\n   - **Anomalies:** None. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   All reports agree on the benign nature of this import statement. They note:\n   - No suspicious patterns\n   - No data flows or external inputs\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent\n   - High confidence (score 1)\n   \n   The scores assigned for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all zero, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; no security risk identified.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   Given the simplicity and benign nature, there is no justification for increasing any of these scores.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The reports are consistent and accurate. The code snippet is a standard import statement with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the reports' consensus. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
