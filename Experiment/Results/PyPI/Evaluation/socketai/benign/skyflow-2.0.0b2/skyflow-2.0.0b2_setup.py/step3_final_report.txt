  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'skyflow' Python SDK, performing environment checks, reading README, and defining dependencies.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, open('README.rst'), dependencies list",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Environment check -> package setup; Reading README -> package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Reading 'README.rst' without exception handling, but this is common and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script with environment validation, package metadata, and dependencies. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The dependencies are standard for an SDK. Minor concern about file reading without exception handling, but this does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The code's structure and dependencies do not suggest any security issues or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
