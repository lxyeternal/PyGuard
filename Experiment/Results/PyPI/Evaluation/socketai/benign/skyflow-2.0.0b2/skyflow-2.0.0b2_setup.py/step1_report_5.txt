{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'skyflow' Python SDK package, used to configure and install the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the current Python version info from sys, reads the long description from 'README.rst', and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "targets": "Dependencies specified in 'install_requires' could potentially be tampered with if the package is installed from untrusted sources, but no direct untrusted data sinks are present in this script.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info (source) is checked against a version constraint; 'README.rst' content is read during setup; dependencies are specified for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected. The license is referenced but not embedded. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: enforcing minimum Python version, defining package metadata, reading a README file for long description, and specifying dependencies. No dynamic code execution or untrusted data handling observed. The dependencies are typical for a Python SDK, and the code structure aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard and benign setup script with no malicious intent. It is well-structured for package configuration without suspicious behavior or malicious payloads.",
