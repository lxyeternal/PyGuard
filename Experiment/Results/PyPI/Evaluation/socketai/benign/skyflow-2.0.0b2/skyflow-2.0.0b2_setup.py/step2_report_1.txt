  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- It performs typical tasks: Python version check, reading `README.rst`, defining dependencies, and setting package metadata.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The dependencies are common for an SDK and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The only minor concern is reading `README.rst` without exception handling, but this is standard practice and unlikely malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies standard setup script.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, with a minor note on reading `README.rst` without exception handling. Still, this is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, dependencies are typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identified no malware presence. I agree with 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly identified no obfuscation. I agree with 0.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assigned 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The minor concern about reading files without exception handling is standard and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
