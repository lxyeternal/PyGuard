  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'skyflow' Python SDK package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, reading 'README.rst' file, checking Python version.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involved; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Input from package requirements and file reading, with no flow leading to potentially malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open('README.rst')' without exception handling; no other unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including version checks and dependency declarations. No user input, network activity, or suspicious code is present. The version check enforces Python 3.8+, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It manages dependencies and package metadata securely. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
