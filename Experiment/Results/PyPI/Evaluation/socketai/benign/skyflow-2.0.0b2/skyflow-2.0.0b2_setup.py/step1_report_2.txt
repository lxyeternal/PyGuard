  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication within this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script primarily configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code performs standard setup operations.",
