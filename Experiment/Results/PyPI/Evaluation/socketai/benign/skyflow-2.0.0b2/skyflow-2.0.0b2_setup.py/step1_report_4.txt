{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'skyflow' Python SDK package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package's README file ('README.rst') to populate 'long_description'. It also accesses package metadata and dependencies defined in the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from reading 'README.rst' into 'long_description' during package setup; dependencies are specified but not dynamically loaded or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. The code performs standard setup operations without any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. The 'long_description' reading could pose a minor concern if 'README.rst' contains malicious content, but this is standard practice in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup using setuptools, enforcing Python version constraints and specifying dependencies. It reads a README file for detailed description. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or malicious behavior is present. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or code that interacts with system resources in an insecure manner. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly reads static files and defines dependencies, following typical packaging conventions.",
