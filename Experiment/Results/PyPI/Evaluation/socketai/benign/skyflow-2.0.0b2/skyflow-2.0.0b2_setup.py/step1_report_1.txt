{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'skyflow' Python package, specifying its metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'README.rst' file for the long description and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows involving untrusted input; dependency installation and package setup are standard operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code is a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks for Python version, reads a description file, and specifies dependencies. All operations are standard for Python package setup. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The dependencies are typical for a secure SDK and do not indicate malicious intent. The only minor concern is reading 'README.rst' without exception handling, but this is standard and unlikely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging the 'skyflow' SDK with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious dependencies, or anomalous code patterns.",
