{
  "purpose": "The code provides formatting functions for various Azure resource and operation data, transforming nested dictionaries into ordered, display-friendly formats.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input dictionaries, often nested, via the _get_value helper function.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file operations are present; data is processed internally for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through _get_value to formatting functions, then to output lists of ordered dicts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dateutil.parser.parse for datetime parsing; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with functions extracting nested data and formatting it into ordered dictionaries for display. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The use of standard libraries for date parsing is safe, and no dynamic code execution or network activity occurs. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by the date parsing but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data formatting utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be maintained or lowered to 0, given the benign nature of the code.",
