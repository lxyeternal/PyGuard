{
  "purpose": "The code provides various formatting functions for different Azure-related resource representations, mainly converting data structures into ordered dictionaries for output display.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, often nested dictionaries representing resource details, event messages, or build info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are evident; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the scope of data formatting. Logging statements are for debugging and do not involve untrusted data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through helper functions (_get_value, _format_datetime, etc.) to produce formatted ordered dicts; no data flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code mainly consists of standard data formatting functions with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. No suspicious external calls or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically extracts nested data from dictionaries to produce formatted output. It uses helper functions to handle nested key retrieval, date parsing, and duration calculations. All functions operate on provided input data and produce formatted representations for display purposes. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The logging is used for debugging and does not involve sensitive data. The code does not perform any network activity, file modification, or contain backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely for data formatting and presentation, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not include any suspicious or harmful operations.",
