{
  "purpose": "The code defines various formatting functions for different result types in a CLI tool, primarily transforming data into OrderedDicts for display.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, primarily 'result' and 'item' dictionaries, and some internal function calls.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted data as lists of OrderedDicts; no external or untrusted data sinks are present that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed into formatting functions, which process and transform data into display-ready structures; no flow leads to system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code is straightforward data formatting with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of data formatting functions used in a CLI context, transforming nested dictionaries into ordered key-value pairs for display. It employs standard Python practices, uses safe data extraction, and includes date parsing for timestamp formatting. No external calls or network activity are present. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious, nor does it contain any obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign and solely focused on formatting and displaying structured data. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It is a well-structured, standard utility code for data presentation.",
