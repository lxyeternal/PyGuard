  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data formatting utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be maintained or lowered to 0, given the benign nature of the code."
