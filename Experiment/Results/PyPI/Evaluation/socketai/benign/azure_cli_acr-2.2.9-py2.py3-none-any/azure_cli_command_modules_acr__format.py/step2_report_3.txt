  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is purely for data formatting, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. No external calls or suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code is straightforward, mainly extracting nested data and formatting it.\n  - No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n  - The logging is only for debugging, not for data exfiltration.\n  - No external network or file operations.\n  - The malware score of 0 and risk score of 0 are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict**: No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, the code is a collection of formatting functions. It uses safe data extraction, date parsing, and no suspicious behavior. Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The only slight concern is the use of `dateutil.parser.parse`. However, this is standard for date parsing and does not introduce malicious behavior.\n  - No dynamic code execution, no external calls, no handling of untrusted data beyond formatting.\n  - The security risk score of 0.1 might be slightly elevated but still minimal, considering the code's purpose.\n\n- **Verdict**: The malware score should remain 0; the security risk score is acceptable at 0.1 given the date parsing but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as above—benign formatting code, safe data extraction, no malicious activity. Malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No suspicious patterns.\n  - Uses safe practices.\n  - No external or network activity.\n  - Scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict**: No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, a set of data formatting functions with safe practices. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No signs of malicious intent.\n  - The use of dynamic imports for date parsing is standard.\n  - No external calls or system modifications.\n\n- **Verdict**: Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same conclusion—benign data formatting utilities, safe code, no malicious activity. Malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n  - Uses safe data access.\n  - No network or file operations.\n\n- **Verdict**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n\n- **Malware scores**: All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, with a score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All reports correctly identify no obfuscation, with a score of 0.\n- **Risk scores**: Given the code's purpose as a safe data formatting utility, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate. Some reports assign 0.1 for minimal risk due to date parsing, which is acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 for all, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 for all, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score**: 0 for all, as the code is purely for data formatting with no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Final note**: The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scores are justified and should be maintained at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of zero.",
