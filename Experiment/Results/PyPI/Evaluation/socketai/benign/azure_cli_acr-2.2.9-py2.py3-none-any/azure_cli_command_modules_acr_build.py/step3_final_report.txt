  "purpose": "Manage Docker image builds for Azure Container Registry, handling local/remote sources, validating Dockerfile, packaging source code, and scheduling build jobs via Azure SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads local source directory or remote URL, Dockerfile path, environment variables, and temporary files for packaging source code.",
  "sinks": "Uploads source code tarball, schedules build run via Azure SDK, streams logs, deletes temporary files.",
  "flows": "Validates source location, creates archive if local, uploads source, constructs build request, schedules build, polls or streams logs based on user options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. External functions are assumed safe; no suspicious patterns in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation, temporary file handling, UUID-based naming, and build scheduling for Azure Container Registry. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or credential leaks are present. External modules like 'upload_source_code' and 'schedule_run' are outside this scope but are typical for such workflows. Use of tempfile, uuid, and logging is standard. The logic flow is straightforward, with proper cleanup. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, implementing a typical Azure CLI build process without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
