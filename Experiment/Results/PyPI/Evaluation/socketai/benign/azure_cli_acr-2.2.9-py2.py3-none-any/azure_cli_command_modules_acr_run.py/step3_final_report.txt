  "purpose": "Manage and schedule container runs on Azure Container Registry, including source validation, encoding, and request submission.",
  "sources": "Local directories (validated and tarred), remote URLs (checked), input parameters (yaml content, source location, credentials).",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK API calls for scheduling runs, network requests for source uploads, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Source location validation → source code packaging/upload or URL check → request creation with encoded content → scheduling via Azure SDK → optional polling/log streaming.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected. Proper cleanup of temporary files and standard encoding practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs source validation, packaging local directories into tar.gz files, encoding YAML and values with base64, and scheduling container runs via Azure SDK. It handles errors appropriately, cleans up temporary files, and logs operations without leaking sensitive data. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The logic aligns with standard Azure CLI extension practices, and the security measures appear sound.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for managing container tasks in Azure, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk (~0.2) scores are justified and appropriate.",
