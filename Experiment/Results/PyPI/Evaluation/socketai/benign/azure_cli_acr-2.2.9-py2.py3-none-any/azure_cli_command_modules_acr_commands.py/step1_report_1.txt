  "flows": "Configuration flow from command definitions to associated SDK/client factory calls. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of client factories and command templates appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up CLI command groups and commands for Azure ACR management, using predefined operation templates, client factories, and output formatting functions. No code injection, network communication, or malicious behavior patterns are present. The code adheres to standard CLI plugin structure without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI extension setup for Azure ACR management. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall structure and content are consistent with legitimate command registration and configuration.",
