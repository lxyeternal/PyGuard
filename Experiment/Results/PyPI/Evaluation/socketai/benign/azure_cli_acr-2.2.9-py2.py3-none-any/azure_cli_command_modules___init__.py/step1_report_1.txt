{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package to allow for namespace packaging and modular distribution.",
  "sources": "The import of pkg_resources and the call to declare_namespace(__name__) which registers the current package as a namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs namespace declaration without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packaging. No unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares the current package as a namespace, which is typical for Python namespace packages. There are no inputs, outputs, or runtime data processing. It does not include any network activity, file I/O, or suspicious behavior. The license comment and copyright notice are standard boilerplate. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for package structuring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. It functions solely to enable namespace packaging.",
