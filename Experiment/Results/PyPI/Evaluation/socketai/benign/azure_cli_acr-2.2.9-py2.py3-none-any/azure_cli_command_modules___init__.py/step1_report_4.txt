  "sources": "Import statement for pkg_resources and namespace declaration",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; usage of declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages, no signs of obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace for the package. This is a common pattern for namespace packages to allow multiple distributions to contribute to a shared namespace. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal and standard, with no dynamic execution, external network access, or data leakage points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
