  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and call to declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Import -> declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "None; standard namespace declaration, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration for Python packages, with no data processing, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It is a common pattern used in Python packaging. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The initial reports correctly assess its safety. The only minor adjustment is lowering the security risk score in report 2 from 0.1 to 0, aligning with the overall benign assessment.",
