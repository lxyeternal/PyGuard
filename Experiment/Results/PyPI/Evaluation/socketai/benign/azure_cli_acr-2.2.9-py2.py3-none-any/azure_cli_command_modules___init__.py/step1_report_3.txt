  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace, which is typically used for package resource management.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are established; the code solely performs namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimalistic, performing only namespace declaration with no additional logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares a namespace for the package, a common practice in Python package management. There are no input sources, data sinks, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code execution. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. It is a standard setup snippet for namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace declaration without malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package setup without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
