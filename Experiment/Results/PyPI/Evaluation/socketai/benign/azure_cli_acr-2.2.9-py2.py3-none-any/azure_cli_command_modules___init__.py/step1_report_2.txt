  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, enabling it to be part of a namespace package structure.",
  "sources": "Reading of the '__name__' variable during the declare_namespace call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace is common in namespace packages but can be used maliciously to hide code or facilitate malicious module imports. However, in this context, it appears to be standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace using 'declare_namespace'. This is a common pattern for Python namespace packages, particularly in larger projects distributed via PyPI. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or code execution. The code is minimal and standard for namespace management. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate part of a namespace package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior. It simply declares a namespace using 'pkg_resources', a common practice in Python packaging.",
