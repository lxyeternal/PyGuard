{
  "purpose": "The code provides constants and functions to retrieve specific model values related to Azure resources such as storage accounts, container registries, webhooks, tasks, and their configurations.",
  "sources": "The functions use the 'cmd' object to call 'get_models' and 'get_sdk' methods, which access model data for resource configurations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code primarily retrieves data from model methods and calls SDK functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'cmd.get_models' calls and 'get_sdk' invocation through the functions returning specific model values or SDK models.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard resource configuration constants and helper functions; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or malicious patterns are present. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of constant definitions and helper functions for retrieving resource model data and SDK models. It employs standard Azure SDK access patterns without any suspicious or malicious constructs. The use of 'cmd.get_models' and 'get_sdk' is typical for Azure CLI extension development. No external data injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The functions simply return predefined model values or SDK objects, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, benign Azure CLI helper functions and constants for managing resource models. There is no malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk detected. It is safe based on this analysis.",
