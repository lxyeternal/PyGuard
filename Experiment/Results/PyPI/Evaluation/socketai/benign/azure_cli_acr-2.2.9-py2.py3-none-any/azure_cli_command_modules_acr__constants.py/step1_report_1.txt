{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants and functions for handling Azure resource types, SKUs, OS, architecture, variants, and run statuses, primarily for Azure Container Registry and related services.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (cmd object), imported modules, and predefined constants.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that handle untrusted data directly; it primarily constructs and returns lists or constants.",
  "flows": "The functions retrieve models via the cmd object, extract values, and return lists; no data flows from untrusted input to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code relies on external models and SDK functions without suspicious manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard set of utility functions for resource and SKU management in Azure SDK context. It imports models via the cmd object and SDK functions, and constructs resource type strings. There is no evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. The functions simply process and return data, with no external communication or insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to define constants and retrieve model data for Azure resource management, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
