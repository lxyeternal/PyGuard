{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and utility functions for managing Azure resources related to storage, container registries, webhooks, and task configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'cmd' object for model definitions and values; no external input sources or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions primarily retrieve static model data and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard resource and model accessor functions, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions and functions that interact with model schemas and resource type strings. It imports modules for SDK retrieval but only uses them to get resource models, with no indication of malicious behavior or dynamic code execution. No external input is processed, and no suspicious data handling or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of configuration constants and simple model accessors for Azure resource management. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
