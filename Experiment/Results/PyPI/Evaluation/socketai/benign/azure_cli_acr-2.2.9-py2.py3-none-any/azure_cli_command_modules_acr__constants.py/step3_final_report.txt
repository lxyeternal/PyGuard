  "purpose": "Utility functions and constants for Azure resource types, SKUs, and model retrieval, used in Azure CLI extensions or SDK helpers.",
  "sources": "Resource type strings, SDK model retrieval via 'cmd.get_models' and 'get_sdk', and static constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external communication; no code injection points.",
  "flows": "Functions retrieve models based on static parameters or SDK calls; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static resource type definitions and simple helper functions that access SDK models via the 'cmd' object and 'get_sdk'. There are no external inputs, no network activity, and no malicious patterns. The functions are standard SDK usage for resource schema access. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified due to the dynamic SDK call but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for Azure resource management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
