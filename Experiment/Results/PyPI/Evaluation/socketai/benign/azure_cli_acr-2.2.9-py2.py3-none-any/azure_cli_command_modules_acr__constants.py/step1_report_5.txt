  "purpose": "Define constants and helper functions for Azure resource management and SDK model retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'cmd', which likely contains model schemas and CLI context.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code primarily defines constants and retrieves SDK models without executing external commands or handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; functions access models and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports resource type constants, defines static resource type strings, and provides functions to retrieve model values from the 'cmd' object. These functions rely on 'cmd.get_models' to obtain model enumerations and return specific attributes or lists. The only potentially dynamic component is 'get_acr_models', which calls 'get_sdk' with 'cmd.cli_ctx' and resource type. However, this is a standard SDK model retrieval pattern without executing untrusted code or external commands. No suspicious patterns, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward helper definitions for Azure SDK interactions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly facilitates retrieving model data for Azure resource configurations. No evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious behavior found.",
