  "purpose": "Define constants and helper functions for managing Azure container registry and SKU models.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'cmd' for functions that fetch models and values from 'cmd.get_models()'. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'cmd' input to model attributes and returned lists; no dangerous data flow paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code mainly consists of static constant definitions and simple wrapper functions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static string constants related to Azure resource types and resource provider names. Several functions retrieve model lists based on 'cmd.get_models()' calls, which depend on the provided 'cmd' object. These functions are simple getters that do not perform any data processing or manipulation. The only dynamic aspect involves calling 'cmd.get_models()' with specified model names and extracting their values, which appears to be standard practice in SDKs for resource management. No input validation issues, no code execution, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. There is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constants and accessor functions for Azure resource models. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It poses no security risks and appears to be a benign utility module.",
