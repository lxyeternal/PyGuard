  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, likely for packaging and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only performs namespace declaration without data movement or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packaging; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace using __name__, which is a common pattern for Python namespace packages. It does not perform any data input/output, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The purpose appears solely related to package namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard namespace declaration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
