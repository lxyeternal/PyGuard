  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, facilitating namespace package management.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module, invocation of declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data handling",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → declare_namespace(__name__) (static, no data flow from untrusted sources)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, standard, and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard pkg_resources module and declares a namespace using declare_namespace(__name__). It is a common pattern in Python packaging for namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
