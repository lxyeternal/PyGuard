  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling it to be part of a namespace package.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import pkg_resources' and the call to 'pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__)'",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data handling, network, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pkg_resources.declare_namespace' is standard for namespace packages; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current module as a namespace package. This pattern is common in Python packaging for modular distribution. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal and typical for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
