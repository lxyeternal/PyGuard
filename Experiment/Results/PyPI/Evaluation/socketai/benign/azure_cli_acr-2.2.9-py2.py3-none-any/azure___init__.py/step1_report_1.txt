  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current module name (__name__) to declare a namespace.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration; no suspicious activity or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and calls declare_namespace with __name__, which is a common pattern for Python namespace packages. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. There are no external network operations, obfuscated code, or other anomalies. The purpose appears to be to set up a namespace for modular distribution. Overall, the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a typical namespace declaration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
