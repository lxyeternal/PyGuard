  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, enabling the package to be part of a namespace package structure.",
  "sources": "The import of pkg_resources and the call to declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; namespace declaration is static and harmless",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; minimal code structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares the current package as a namespace package, a common pattern for modular package distribution. There are no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data leaks. The code is minimal, standard, and intended solely for package namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard namespace declaration purpose without any malicious intent or security risks.",
