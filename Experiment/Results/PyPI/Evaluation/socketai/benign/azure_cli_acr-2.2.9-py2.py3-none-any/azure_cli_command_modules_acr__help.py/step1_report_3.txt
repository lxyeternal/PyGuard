  "purpose": "This code provides command help documentation and descriptions for managing Azure Container Registries via CLI commands. It defines help text and examples for various commands and groups related to Azure Container Registries (ACR).",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for command descriptions, examples, and help text. There are no user input sources, external data inputs, or dynamic data reads present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present. The code does not execute or process untrusted data, nor does it send data over the network or perform any system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of static help documentation and command descriptions, with no executable or input-processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely static documentation for CLI commands, with no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. No hard-coded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. No unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of help text strings for CLI commands related to Azure Container Registry management. It is well-structured and contains no executable logic, user input handling, or network communication. It is purely documentation meant to assist users in understanding available commands. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns in the static strings. The absence of code execution or data processing indicates a low risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign documentation module for CLI help texts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code. It is safe and solely intended for user guidance.",
