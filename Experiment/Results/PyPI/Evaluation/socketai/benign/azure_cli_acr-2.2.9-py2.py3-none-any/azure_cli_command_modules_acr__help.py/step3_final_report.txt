  "purpose": "Static help documentation strings and command definitions for Azure CLI commands related to Azure Container Registry management.",
  "sources": "Help strings, command metadata, and examples embedded as static strings within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; purely static help text.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; no data input or output beyond static documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no embedded secrets, no malicious code, no dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static help documentation and command descriptions for Azure CLI. There are no executable components, no data processing, no external interactions, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The help strings serve as static documentation for CLI commands, with examples provided for user guidance. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the confidence in benign nature is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static help documentation for Azure CLI commands related to Azure Container Registry management. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is safe for use. The current scores are accurate and consistent with its static, documentation-only nature.",
