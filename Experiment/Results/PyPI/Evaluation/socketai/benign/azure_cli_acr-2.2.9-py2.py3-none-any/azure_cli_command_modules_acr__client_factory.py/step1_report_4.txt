  "purpose": "Provides factory functions to instantiate Azure management service clients for ARM resources, storage, and container registries.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function parameters (cli_ctx, api_version).",
  "sinks": "Calls to get_mgmt_service_client with various resource types, potentially fetching client objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'cli_ctx' flows into get_mgmt_service_client calls, which return client objects for management operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code follows standard Azure SDK client factory patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward functions importing specific Azure SDK modules and returning client objects for managing resources such as ARM, storage, and container registries. The usage pattern is standard for Azure CLI extension development, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious code. The functions simply serve as wrappers to instantiate service clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Azure SDK client factories with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be legitimate and safe for use.",
