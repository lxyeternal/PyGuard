  "purpose": "Factory functions for creating Azure SDK clients for resource management, storage, container registry, etc.",
  "sources": "Import statements and function parameters providing CLI context",
  "sinks": "Client instantiation via get_mgmt_service_client; no data flows into insecure sinks",
  "flows": "Input CLI context flows into client creation functions, which return SDK client objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward factory functions importing Azure SDK modules and returning client instances based on the provided CLI context. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is standard boilerplate for Azure CLI extensions, with no anomalies or obfuscation. The functions do not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight elevation in security risk is unwarranted given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard Azure SDK client factory functions with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware and obfuscation scores are correct at 0. The minimal security risk scores of 0.1 in some reports should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
