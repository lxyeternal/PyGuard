  "purpose": "Provides functions to obtain Azure resource management clients for ARM, storage, and container registry services.",
  "sources": "Imports from azure.cli.core.commands.client_factory, azure.mgmt.resource, azure.cli.core.profiles, and azure.mgmt.containerregistry modules; function parameters such as cli_ctx and api_version.",
  "sinks": "Calls to get_mgmt_service_client with various service clients, which interact with Azure management APIs.",
  "flows": "Input parameter cli_ctx is used to instantiate service clients, which then provide access to Azure resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, and no dynamic code execution detected. Usage of standard SDK functions and imports indicates typical behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Azure SDK modules and defines wrapper functions to retrieve management clients for ARM, storage, and container registry services. These functions facilitate resource management operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions rely on the provided cli_ctx parameter, which is typical for Azure CLI extension code. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity is evident. The code appears to be boilerplate setup code for Azure management SDK usage, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and intended for managing Azure resources via SDK clients. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. It simply wraps SDK client retrieval functions for different Azure services.",
