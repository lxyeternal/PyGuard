  "purpose": "Provides factory functions to instantiate Azure management service clients for ARM resources, storage, and container registries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Azure SDK modules, function parameters, and return statements invoking client factory methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements calling get_mgmt_service_client() which is assumed to create API client objects; no direct untrusted data sink found.",
  "flows": "Function parameters (cli_ctx, api_version) flow into get_mgmt_service_client() calls to produce specific management clients.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The import and function structures are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple wrapper functions that import specific Azure SDK clients and return them via a common factory method. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. All imports and function behaviors are typical for SDK client instantiation. No use of untrusted input or insecure practices identified. The code appears to be a standard SDK wrapper for Azure management operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of straightforward factory functions for creating Azure SDK clients related to resource management, storage, and container registries. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
