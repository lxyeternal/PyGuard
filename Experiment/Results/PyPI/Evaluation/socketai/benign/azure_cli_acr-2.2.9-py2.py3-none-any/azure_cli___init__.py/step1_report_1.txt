  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, allowing for modular distribution and plugin architecture.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources and declaring a namespace with __name__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; namespace declaration is static",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace is somewhat uncommon in modern Python packaging but not malicious; no unusual code behavior or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace for modular package distribution, a standard practice in some Python packages. There are no inputs, no data handling, and no suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, external connections, or credential handling is present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
