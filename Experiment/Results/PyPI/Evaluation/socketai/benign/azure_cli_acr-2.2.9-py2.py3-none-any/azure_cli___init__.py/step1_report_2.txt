  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the package to support namespace packages in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports the pkg_resources module, which is used to manage package resources and declare namespace packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code only declares a namespace with no additional logic; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares a namespace for the current package. This is a standard pattern in Python for creating namespace packages, allowing multiple packages to share the same namespace. The code is minimal, with no input handling, data processing, or network activity. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration without any malicious intent or security concerns. It simply facilitates package organization and does not perform any harmful actions.",
