{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, typically used for package modularization and organization.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) for namespace declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for namespace declaration, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace using 'declare_namespace'. This is a common pattern in Python packages to facilitate namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard package organization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign namespace declaration with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
