  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources and calling declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external connections, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static namespace declaration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace with declare_namespace(__name__), a common pattern in Python packaging. No inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is minimal, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or secrets. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero. The slight risk score of 0.1 in some reports is marginal; a score of 0 would be more precise given the benign nature. Confidence in benign assessment is high (near 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, with minor score adjustments (risk to 0, confidence to 1) recommended for consistency.",
