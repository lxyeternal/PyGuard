  "purpose": "Declare namespace for the package to allow for namespace extension and modularization.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module name (__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace is unusual in modern Python packaging, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares a namespace using declare_namespace. This is a standard practice in Python packages to support namespace packages, especially in older distributions. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data or execute malicious code. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign component of package setup.",
