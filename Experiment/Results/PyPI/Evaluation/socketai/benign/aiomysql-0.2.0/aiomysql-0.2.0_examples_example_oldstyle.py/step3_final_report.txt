  "purpose": "Perform an open-source dependency security review focusing on malicious behavior, sabotage, and security risks within the provided Python code.",
  "sources": "Database connection parameters (host, port, user, password), execution of SQL query, printing results",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL query with hardcoded credentials, potential data access or leakage if credentials are compromised",
  "flows": "Hardcoded credentials → database connection → SQL query execution → data retrieval and printing",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated asyncio coroutine syntax, hardcoded empty password for 'root' user",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an asynchronous connection to a local MySQL database with insecure credentials, executes a simple SELECT query, and prints the results. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The insecure credentials pose a security risk but do not indicate malicious intent. The use of deprecated syntax is a stylistic issue. No data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or sabotage behaviors are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.3-0.4) due to insecure credentials.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward asynchronous database query script with insecure credential practices but no malicious intent or malware. The security risk is moderate due to hardcoded credentials, especially an empty password, but no active malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.",
