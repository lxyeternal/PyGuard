  "purpose": "This code demonstrates asynchronous MySQL database operations, including table creation, data insertion, rollback, verification, and cleanup, primarily for testing or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "Static SQL statements and hardcoded connection parameters (host='127.0.0.1', user='root', password='')",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL commands via cursor.execute and cursor.executemany; fetchall() retrieves data; connection close",
  "flows": "Source: Static SQL and connection parameters -> Sink: SQL execution and data retrieval",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated @asyncio.coroutine syntax; insecure default credentials (empty password for 'root')",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard asyncio-based database operations without any untrusted input or malicious payloads. It uses hardcoded credentials with an empty password, which is insecure but typical for local testing. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code's behavior is benign, and the only security concern is the insecure credentials, which do not constitute malicious activity. The code structure and logic are straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of asynchronous database handling with no malicious intent. The primary security issue is the use of insecure default credentials, which should be secured in production. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
