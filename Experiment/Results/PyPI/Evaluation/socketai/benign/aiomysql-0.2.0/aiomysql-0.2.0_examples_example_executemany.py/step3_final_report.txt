{
  "purpose": "This code establishes an asynchronous connection to a local MySQL database, creates a table, inserts multiple rows, and retrieves all data from the table.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credentials (host, user, password), static SQL queries, predefined data for insertion.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL commands with parameterized queries; no untrusted input or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Connection setup → table creation → data insertion → data retrieval → result processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded credentials ('root' user with empty password), which is insecure but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard database operations using asyncio and aiomysql. It does not include any malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The only security concern is the use of default credentials, which is typical in test scripts but insecure in production. SQL queries are parameterized, reducing injection risk. No external input or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing typical database interactions without malicious intent. The primary security issue is insecure credentials, which should be secured in production environments. Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
