  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flow issues.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credentials (host='127.0.0.1', user='root', password='')",
  "sinks": "Database connection, SQL execution, print statements",
  "flows": "Credentials and connection parameters are used to establish a database connection; static SQL query executed; results printed",
  "anomalies": "Use of default root credentials with empty password; no dynamic input or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an asynchronous connection to a local MySQL database using hardcoded default credentials, executes a static SQL query returning a JSON object, and prints the results. No user input, dynamic SQL, or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is the insecure credentials, which are typical in development environments but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious data flows, backdoors, or malicious actions such as data exfiltration or remote code execution. The code is straightforward, readable, and does not contain obfuscation or malware. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting insecure credentials but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a static database query with insecure default credentials. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the insecure credentials, which warrant caution but do not constitute malware or active threats. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a low security risk score of 0.2.",
