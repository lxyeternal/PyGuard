  "purpose": "This code demonstrates asynchronous interaction with a MySQL database using aiomysql, creating a table, inserting multiple rows, and fetching data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded host, port, user, password, and database parameters; static SQL queries; no user input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "SQL execution commands with static queries; no untrusted data flow or external data sinks; no network activity beyond database connection.",
  "flows": "Connection parameters → SQL commands (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT) → fetch results; no dynamic or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an empty password for database connection; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns; straightforward and standard code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database operations with static SQL statements and hardcoded credentials. No user input or dynamic data is processed, reducing injection risk. The only security concern is the insecure (empty) password, which is a configuration issue, not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The code is benign and typical for database interaction scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward demonstration of asyncio-based MySQL operations with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the insecure credential (empty password), which is a misconfiguration rather than malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the insecure credential but no malicious behavior.",
