  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- **Purpose:** All reports describe the code as a configuration script for Sphinx documentation for the 'aiomysql' project.\n- **Sources:** Import of `__version__` from `aiomysql`, environment variable `READTHEDOCS`, static paths.\n- **Sinks:** No data flows to external systems, no untrusted data processing.\n- **Flows:** Environment variable influences theme selection; version info is used for documentation metadata.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports agree that the code is standard, benign configuration code with no malicious intent, no external network activity, and no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n- The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file.\n- No code injection, dynamic code execution, or external network activity.\n- No use of untrusted input beyond environment variable checks, which are standard practice.\n- The import of `__version__` is from the package itself, not from untrusted sources.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code shows no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues are present.\n- **Code Behavior:** Safe, standard configuration.\n- **External Data/Network Activity:** None.\n- **Malicious Intent:** Absent.\n- **Obfuscation:** Absent.\n- **Supply Chain Risk:** None.\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
