  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code in question.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script for building project documentation.\n- It imports the package version (`__version__`) from `aiomysql`.\n- It checks an environment variable (`READTHEDOCS`) to determine the theme.\n- It sets various configuration options, paths, and extensions.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted user input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is static and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code presence of all expected elements**: No anomalies or malicious code detected.\n- **No suspicious behaviors**: No code injection, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Environment variable usage** is standard for deployment environments like Read the Docs.\n- **Import of version info** is typical for documentation scripts.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The code functions as intended for its purpose.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|----------|----------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1        | 0              | 0                | 0            | Benign configuration script, no malicious behavior. |\n| 2        | 0              | 0                | 0            | Standard setup, no suspicious activity. |\n| 3        | 0              | 0                | 0            | Typical configuration, no malicious intent. |\n| 4        | 0              | 0                | 0            | Straightforward, no signs of malicious code. |\n| 5        | 0              | 0                | 0            | No security risks, purely configuration. |\n\n**All reports** correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0; no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The environment variable check is standard practice.\n- Importing version info from a package is common and safe.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis above.",
