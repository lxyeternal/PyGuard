  "conclusion": "The code is benign, demonstrating typical database transaction procedures without malicious behavior. The primary security issue is the use of default credentials, which should be changed in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.2) due to configuration issues, not code maliciousness."
