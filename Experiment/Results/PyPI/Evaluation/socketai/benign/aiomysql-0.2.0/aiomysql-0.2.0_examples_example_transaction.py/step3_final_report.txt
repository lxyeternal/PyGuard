  "purpose": "This code demonstrates asynchronous database transaction handling using aiomysql, including create, insert, rollback, select, and cleanup operations.",
  "sources": "Database connection parameters, SQL statements for creating, inserting, selecting, and dropping tables.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL commands with parameterized queries; no untrusted data handling or external data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Source: connection parameters and SQL statements -> Sink: execution via cursor -> Flow: data insertion, rollback, selection, and cleanup operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of default credentials ('root' with empty password) is insecure but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard asyncio-based database operations with no signs of malicious activity. It uses parameterized queries, performs a rollback to test transaction handling, and cleans up by dropping the table. No network activity beyond database interaction, no hardcoded secrets beyond default credentials, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The only security concern is the default credentials, which are insecure in production but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, demonstrating typical database transaction procedures without malicious behavior. The primary security issue is the use of default credentials, which should be changed in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.2) due to configuration issues, not code maliciousness.",
