There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious data flows. The security risk is low but notable due to the credentials. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3, primarily due to insecure credentials. No active threat or malicious intent is detected."

The primary security issue is the use of insecure default credentials, which should be secured in production. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
