  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly states that the code is only managing imports and exports, with no data processing or malicious activity. No issues are present in the code.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward. No errors identified.\n\n- **Scores:** The report assigns malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n- **Justification:** Since the code is purely for module setup with optional dependencies, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The analysis correctly notes that the code manages optional dependencies and exports functions, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** The use of silent `try-except` for ImportError is standard but could potentially hide missing dependencies; however, this isn't malicious, just a design choice.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The report assigns a small security risk due to silent failures but no malware. This seems reasonable.\n\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is justified given the code's benign nature, though silent import failures could be a minor operational concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is similar in structure—conditional imports for optional dependencies. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is accurate; no issues.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report's assessment is consistent.\n\n- **Justification:** No risk or malware is detected; the code is standard for optional dependency management.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a benign setup module with no data handling or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues in reasoning.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The analysis correctly states that the code is primarily managing imports and exports, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors/flaws:** The silent handling of ImportError is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Given the benign nature, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the minimal security concern—mainly the silent import failure handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — The code is clear and standard.\n\n**Risk:** Given the nature of the code, I would assign a risk score of **0.05** to reflect the silent import failures, which could cause operational issues but not security risks.\n\n**Additional notes:** The code is a typical pattern for handling optional dependencies in Python modules, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable; minor adjustment to risk to 0.05 could be considered, but 0.1 is acceptable.\n- No further action needed; the code is benign.",
