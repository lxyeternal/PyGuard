{
  "purpose": "Define module exports for Cognito JWT handling, including synchronous and asynchronous decoding functions, with optional imports for HTTP request libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'requests', 'aiohttp', and internal decode functions from relative modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; no external data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; conditional imports do not involve data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; straightforward conditional imports based on module availability.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and conditional imports for optional dependencies. It includes no data processing, user input handling, or network communications. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The structure is clear and typical for a modular Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup module that conditionally includes optional dependencies for JWT decoding functionality. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for Python packages managing optional dependencies.",
