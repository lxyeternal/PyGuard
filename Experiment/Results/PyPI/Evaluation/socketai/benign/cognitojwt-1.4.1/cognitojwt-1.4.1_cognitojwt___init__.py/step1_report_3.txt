{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports and attempts to import optional dependencies for synchronous and asynchronous JWT decoding, likely for a Cognito JWT verification library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statements for 'requests', 'aiohttp', 'async_lru', and local modules such as '.jwt_sync' and '.jwt_async'. It also reads the '__all__' list to determine exported functions/classes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow into the decode and decode_async functions if used improperly elsewhere, but this code does not process input data directly.",
  "flows": "The flow involves attempting to import optional modules; if successful, it appends corresponding decode functions to '__all__'. No direct data processing or external data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard conditional imports, manages optional dependencies gracefully, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing a specific exception and defining the module's name and exports. It then tries to import 'requests' and a local synchronous decode function, appending 'decode' to '__all__' if successful. Similarly, it attempts to import 'aiohttp', 'async_lru', and an async decode function, appending 'decode_async' if available. There is no processing of untrusted input, no network activity, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical pattern for handling optional dependencies in a Python package for JWT handling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to set up module exports and conditionally import dependencies for JWT decoding. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
