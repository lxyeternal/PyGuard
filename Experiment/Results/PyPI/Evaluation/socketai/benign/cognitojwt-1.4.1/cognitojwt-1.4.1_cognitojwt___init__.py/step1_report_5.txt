{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports exceptions and decoding functions related to Cognito JWT tokens, with conditional imports for optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the module's own 'exceptions' and 'jwt_sync'/'jwt_async' files, and attempts to import third-party libraries such as 'requests', 'aiohttp', and 'async_lru'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or data sinks are directly present; the code mainly sets up imports and exports functions for token decoding.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from external sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code only conditionally imports modules and modifies '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional imports based on availability, but nothing unusual or suspicious like hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing a specific exception. It then sets a module name and initializes the '__all__' list with the exception. It conditionally imports 'requests' and 'decode' from '.jwt_sync', appending 'decode' to '__all__' if successful. Similarly, it tries to import 'aiohttp', 'alru_cache', and 'decode_async' for asynchronous JWT decoding, appending 'decode_async' upon success. The pattern indicates optional dependencies to support both sync and async JWT decoding, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The use of conditional imports is standard practice for optional dependencies, and no code injection or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This module primarily sets up exceptions and conditional import mechanisms for JWT decoding functions, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a benign, dependency-aware setup code.",
