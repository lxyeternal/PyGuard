  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report states no malicious or suspicious code is present. The code is simply managing optional dependencies and setting up exports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n- **Scores:** All scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No reason to adjust scores; the code is benign and straightforward.\n- **Overall:** Confirmed as safe, accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report notes that silent handling of ImportError could hide missing dependencies but doesn't consider this a security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The small risk score accounts for potential dependency issues but not malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score seems reasonable given the context.\n- **Overall:** The assessment is sound; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes that the code is a standard pattern for optional dependencies.\n- **Scores:** All zero for malware and obfuscated, risk=0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code is typical for dependency management.\n- **Scores:** All scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No malicious activity, just setup code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report emphasizes the standard pattern and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All scores are zero or very low, reflecting benign code.\n- **Overall:** Valid and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets in all reports are consistent with their descriptions.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk scores:** All reports assign very low or zero scores, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Potential issues:** The only minor concern is the silent handling of ImportError, which could hide missing dependencies, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the overall risk remains very low, around 0.0 to 0.1, primarily due to dependency management practices rather than security issues.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's straightforward nature.",
