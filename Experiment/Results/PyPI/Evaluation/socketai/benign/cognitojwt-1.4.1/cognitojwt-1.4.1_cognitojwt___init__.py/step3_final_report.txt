  "purpose": "Manage optional dependencies and export relevant functions for JWT decoding in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports of 'requests', 'aiohttp', 'async_lru', and internal decode functions based on import success.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Import attempts and conditional exports; no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Silent handling of ImportError, which could hide missing dependencies but is a common pattern and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for optional dependencies, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The silent ImportError handling is typical but could cause runtime issues if dependencies are missing. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects minimal operational concern rather than security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments needed.",
