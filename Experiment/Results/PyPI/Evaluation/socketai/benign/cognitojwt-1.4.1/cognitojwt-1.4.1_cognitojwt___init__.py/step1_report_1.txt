{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports exception classes and functions related to JWT decoding, both synchronously and asynchronously, for a Cognito JWT library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'requests', 'aiohttp', and internal modules (.jwt_sync, .jwt_async). The code reads module imports, which may be optional.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted input; the code mainly imports modules and defines exports.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code imports modules and conditionally adds functions to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of conditional imports based on availability is normal for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing an exception class, then sets a package name and an __all__ list for exports. It conditionally imports 'requests' and a decode function, appending 'decode' to __all__ if successful. Similarly, it conditionally imports 'aiohttp', 'alru_cache', and 'decode_async', appending 'decode_async' to __all__. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no data leakage or suspicious network activity. All operations are standard for a modular package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module setup for a JWT handling library, with optional dependencies handled gracefully. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
