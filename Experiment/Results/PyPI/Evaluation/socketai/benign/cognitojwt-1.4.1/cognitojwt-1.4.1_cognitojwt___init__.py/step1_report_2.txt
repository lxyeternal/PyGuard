{
  "purpose": "This module appears to manage imports and exports related to Cognito JWT handling, including synchronous and asynchronous decoding functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package (.exceptions, .jwt_sync, .jwt_async), and dynamic imports of external libraries (requests, aiohttp, async_lru).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the code only imports modules and conditionally adds functions to __all__.",
  "flows": "Imports are conditional; if the dependencies are available, functions like decode and decode_async are added to __all__, enabling external use.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses try-except to silently ignore ImportError, which might hide missing dependencies but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports and exports for JWT decoding functionalities. It conditionally imports dependencies and appends functions to __all__, facilitating modular usage. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The silent handling of ImportError could be a minor concern for missing dependencies but does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import and export module with no signs of malicious behavior. It handles optional dependencies gracefully and exposes relevant functions if available. There are no indications of malware, secret leaks, or security vulnerabilities within this fragment.",
