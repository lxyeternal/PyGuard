  "sinks": "raise CognitoJWTException on invalid token use, expiration, or client ID mismatch",
  "flows": "Extraction of headers/claims -> expiration check or client ID validation -> exception if invalid",
  "anomalies": "Use of unverified claims without signature verification; reliance on unverified data could be risky if used improperly",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward JWT utility module that extracts unverified headers and claims, checks expiration, and validates client IDs. It does not verify signatures, which is acceptable if full verification occurs elsewhere. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls are present. The main security concern is the reliance on unverified claims, which is acknowledged and standard for preliminary validation. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent and justified given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious JWT utility with no obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the use of unverified claims, which is acceptable if proper signature verification is performed elsewhere. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
