  "purpose": "Utility functions for verifying and extracting information from JWT tokens, specifically for AWS Cognito integration.",
  "sources": "Reading JWT tokens (get_unverified_headers, get_unverified_claims), reading current time (time.time()), reading token claims and parameters (claims['token_use'], claims[client_id_key])",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code primarily reads and raises exceptions; no data outputs or network calls",
  "flows": "JWT token is read to extract headers and claims; expiration is checked against current time; client ID is validated against claims",
  "anomalies": "Use of unverified token headers and claims could be risky if used improperly; however, functions are for extracting info, not trusting unverified data for security decisions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected. No suspicious data manipulation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to extract unverified headers and claims from JWT tokens, check for expiration, and validate the client ID. It does not perform any dangerous operations like executing code from tokens or making network requests. The only potential risk is the use of unverified token data, but this is appropriate for preliminary checks before full validation. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors identified. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility module for JWT handling with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for JWT processing in an AWS Cognito context, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It relies on well-known libraries and performs safe operations, with proper exception handling. No security risks are evident.",
