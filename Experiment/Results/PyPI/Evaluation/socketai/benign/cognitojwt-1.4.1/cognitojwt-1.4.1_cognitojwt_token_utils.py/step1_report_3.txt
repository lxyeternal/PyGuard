  "purpose": "Utility functions for verifying and extracting information from JWT tokens issued by Cognito, including header and claim verification, expiration check, and client ID validation.",
  "sources": "jwt.get_unverified_headers(token), jwt.get_unverified_claims(token), time.time(), claims['token_use'], claims[client_id_key]",
  "sinks": "Exceptions raised on invalid or expired tokens, no direct data leaks or unsafe operations present",
  "flows": "Token input → get_unverified_headers/get_unverified_claims → check_expired and check_client_id functions which raise exceptions on invalid conditions",
  "anomalies": "Use of unverified token claims, which is expected but can be a point of concern if tokens are maliciously crafted; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed; straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code provides JWT token validation functions, relying on the 'jose' library to extract headers and claims without verification. The expiration check compares current time with 'exp' claim, raising an exception if expired. The client ID check validates the 'token_use' and matching 'client_id' or 'aud' claims against expected values. No suspicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code's use of unverified claims can be acceptable in contexts where tokens are validated elsewhere, but could be exploited if combined with untrusted tokens. Overall, the functions are standard and do not contain malware or security risks, aside from the known caveat of unverified claim parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JWT utility module with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs token header and claim extraction and validation functions with typical exception handling. The reliance on unverified claims warrants careful use, but within the scope, no security threats or malicious behavior are present.",
