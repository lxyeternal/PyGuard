{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for verifying and extracting claims from JWT tokens, specifically for AWS Cognito integration.",
  "sources": "jwt.get_unverified_headers(token), jwt.get_unverified_claims(token), and access to claims like 'token_use', 'client_id', 'aud', 'exp'.",
  "sinks": "Exceptions raised on token expiration or invalid client IDs, but no critical data sinks or external calls are directly present.",
  "flows": "Extraction of JWT headers and claims, followed by validation checks such as token expiration and client ID matching.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic code execution or external network calls. The token validation relies on unverified headers and claims, but this is typical for such utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and jwt for token handling, with functions to extract unverified headers and claims. The check_expired function compares the token expiration to current time, raising an exception if expired. The check_client_id function verifies that the token's 'token_use' field matches expected values, then confirms the 'client_id' or 'aud' claim matches provided app client IDs. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious activities. Its sole purpose is to validate JWT tokens in a straightforward manner. The functions are simple and do not contain any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard JWT utility module with no signs of malicious intent. It performs expected token validation steps without suspicious behavior. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on this code snippet.",
