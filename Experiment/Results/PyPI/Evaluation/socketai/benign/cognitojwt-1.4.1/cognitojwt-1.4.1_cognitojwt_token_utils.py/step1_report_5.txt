  "flows": "Input token -> get headers/claims -> verify expiration -> verify client ID -> possibly raise exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Functions perform standard JWT verification steps.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT header and claim extraction without validation, checks for token expiration, and validates the client ID against expected values. It uses a simple dictionary for token use to key mapping and raises exceptions on invalid token use or expiration. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or malicious data handling is present. The code relies on the 'jose' library for JWT handling, which is common and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of JWT validation logic with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard JWT verification functions for AWS Cognito tokens with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only raises exceptions upon invalid tokens or claims. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
