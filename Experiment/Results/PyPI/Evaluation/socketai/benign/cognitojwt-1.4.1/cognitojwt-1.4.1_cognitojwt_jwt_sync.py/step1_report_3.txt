{
  "purpose": "This code is used to verify and decode JWT tokens issued by AWS Cognito, fetching public keys from a remote URL or local file, verifying signatures, and extracting claims.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'AWS_COGNITO_JWKS_PATH' for JWKS URL; token string input; HTTP request to fetch JWKS; file read for local JWKS; environment variables; JWT headers and claims.",
  "sinks": "Signature verification process; raising exceptions on failure; returning token claims.",
  "flows": "JWKS URL from environment or constant -> fetch keys -> select key matching 'kid' from token header -> verify token signature with public key -> decode claims -> check expiration and client ID if provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of standard libraries and common practices for JWT verification.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard JWT validation procedures, including fetching keys, signature verification, and claims validation. It uses environment variables and external requests securely. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious data flows are present. The only external data flow involves fetching JWKS, which is a normal operation in token validation. No unusual code or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for JWT verification against AWS Cognito. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations securely without anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
