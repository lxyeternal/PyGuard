  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard JWT verification implementation for AWS Cognito.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code uses environment variables, external URL fetching, and cryptographic verification in a typical manner.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero across reports, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly fetches keys, verifies signatures, checks expiration, and optionally validates client IDs.\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are evident; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None; the code performs cryptographic verification without malicious payloads.\n- **Flow and logic:** Straightforward, standard JWT validation pattern.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The use of `requests.get` for fetching JWKS is typical, but if the URL is untrusted or compromised, it could be a vector for supply chain issues. However, this is a standard pattern, and the code does not introduce malicious behavior.\n- The caching of keys with `lru_cache` helps efficiency but does not impact security negatively.\n- No code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable; minimal risk, primarily dependent on external URL trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes needed unless additional context suggests compromised URLs or environment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a typical, secure implementation of JWT validation for AWS Cognito, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities based on the provided snippets and reports.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify the code as a standard, secure JWT validation routine. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
