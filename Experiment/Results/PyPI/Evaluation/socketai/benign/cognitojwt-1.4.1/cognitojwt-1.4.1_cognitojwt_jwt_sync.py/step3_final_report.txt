{
  "purpose": "This code verifies AWS Cognito JWT tokens by fetching the appropriate public keys, verifying the token signature, and validating claims such as expiration and client ID.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the JWT token string, environment variables for the JWKS URL, and fetches the JWKS from a URL or local file.",
  "sinks": "The code verifies the token signature and expiration; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The token is split into message and signature, the public key is retrieved based on 'kid', signature is verified, then claims are validated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT validation for AWS Cognito tokens, fetching keys securely with caching, verifying signatures cryptographically, and validating claims. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. External URL fetching is standard for JWKS retrieval, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The code structure is clear and follows best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of JWT validation with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate.",
