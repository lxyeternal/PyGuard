{
  "purpose": "This code is used for verifying and decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued by AWS Cognito, primarily for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the JWT token provided to the decode function, environment variables (AWS_COGNITO_JWKS_PATH), and URLs or files for obtaining public keys.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests (requests.get) for fetching JWKS, reading from files, and cryptographic verification processes. No direct data leaks or external calls are made with untrusted data beyond initial fetching of keys.",
  "flows": "The code fetches keys from a URL or file, extracts the key ID from the JWT headers, retrieves the matching public key, verifies the signature, and then processes claims, including expiration and client ID validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. The code correctly avoids executing untrusted data directly. It uses cache for keys, and the only external communication is fetching JWKS. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches and caches public keys, verifies JWT signatures using standard libraries, and checks token expiration and client ID claims. It performs expected validation steps. The use of environment variables and URL templates is standard. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code handles errors appropriately by raising exceptions. No obfuscated or unusual language features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for JWT validation in a server-side authentication context. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
