  "purpose": "This code is designed to verify and decode JWT tokens issued by AWS Cognito, ensuring the token's authenticity and extracting claims.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'AWS_COGNITO_JWKS_PATH', function input parameter 'token', 'region', 'userpool_id', HTTP GET request to 'keys_url', local file read (if keys_url is local file path).",
  "sinks": "Signature verification step with public key, reading of JWKS keys, raising exceptions on failures, returning decoded claims.",
  "flows": "Token string -> parse message and signature -> fetch public keys -> verify signature -> extract claims -> validate claims -> return claims.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of environment variables for URL, standard cryptographic verification, and no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches public keys either via HTTP request or local file, caches them, then verifies JWT signatures with these keys. It uses standard libraries and procedures for JWT validation, including claim validation. No hidden or malicious code constructs observed. The code handles errors properly and does not execute untrusted code or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of JWT verification for AWS Cognito tokens. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. No security risks are evident in this snippet; it follows best practices for token validation.",
