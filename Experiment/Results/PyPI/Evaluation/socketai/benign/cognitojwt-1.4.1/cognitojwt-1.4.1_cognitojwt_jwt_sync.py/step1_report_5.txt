{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify JWT tokens issued by AWS Cognito, retrieving public keys, decoding tokens, and validating claims.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'AWS_COGNITO_JWKS_PATH', request to external URL for JWKS, and token input parameter.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URL, reading local files, cryptographic verification, raising exceptions on failures.",
  "flows": "Environment variable or URL fetch -> get_keys() -> get_public_key() -> decode() -> verify signature -> validate claims.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard cryptographic operations; no suspicious URL patterns or unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code properly retrieves public keys from either a URL or local file, uses cryptographic verification to validate JWT signatures, and checks token expiration and client ID. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network behavior. The token verification process relies on standard libraries and conventions. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. The flow from input token through cryptographic verification and claim validation appears consistent with secure token validation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard JWT validation for AWS Cognito tokens, with proper signature verification and claim checks. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate, security-focused implementation.",
