{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to asynchronously retrieve public keys, verify JWT tokens, and decode them for authentication purposes, specifically in the context of AWS Cognito.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables ('AWS_COGNITO_JWKS_PATH'), URLs for JWKS, token input, and potentially files from the filesystem (if URL is local).",
  "sinks": "The code performs cryptographic verification of tokens, and returns decoded claims; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input token -> get_public_key_async retrieves keys -> verify signature with jwk.construct -> decode and verify claims -> return claims.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of standard libraries and patterns. No network communications other than fetching keys. No data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely fetches and caches public keys, verifies JWT signatures, and checks token expiry and client ID. It uses well-known libraries (aiohttp, jose) for cryptographic operations. No indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations. The logic is straightforward, following standard JWT validation procedures. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard JWT validation and decoding for AWS Cognito, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It employs secure practices and appropriate libraries, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
