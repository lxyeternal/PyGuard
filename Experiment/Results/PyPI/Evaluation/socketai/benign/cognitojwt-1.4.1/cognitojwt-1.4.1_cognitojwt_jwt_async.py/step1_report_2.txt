{
  "purpose": "The code verifies and decodes JWT tokens from AWS Cognito, fetching public keys dynamically to ensure token authenticity.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'AWS_COGNITO_JWKS_PATH', token input parameter, and remote or local JSON files for public keys.",
  "sinks": "Uses the public key to verify JWT signature, raises exceptions on failures, and decodes token claims.",
  "flows": "Token -> get_unverified_headers -> get_public_key_async -> verify signature -> decode claims -> check expiration and client ID",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic key fetching; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code. The use of environment variables and external URLs appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs JWT verification by fetching public keys either from a URL or local file, then uses these keys to verify token signatures. It employs asynchronous I/O for efficiency, and performs validation checks on token expiration and client ID. No suspicious or malicious code segments, such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to follow standard security practices for token validation. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior beyond typical JWT handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a secure JWT validation utility with proper asynchronous handling and external key fetching. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
