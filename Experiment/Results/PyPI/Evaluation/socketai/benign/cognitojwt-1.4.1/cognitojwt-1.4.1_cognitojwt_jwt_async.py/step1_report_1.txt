{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) from AWS Cognito, fetching public keys dynamically from a URL or file, verifying signatures, and checking token validity.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (AWS_COGNITO_JWKS_PATH), external URLs for public keys, and JWT tokens for decoding and verification.",
  "sinks": "Uses public key for signature verification, raises exceptions on failure, and performs claims validation. No data output or network transmission of untrusted data observed.",
  "flows": "Fetches keys -> Retrieves token headers -> Finds matching key -> Verifies signature -> Checks claims and expiration -> Validates client ID.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials. Uses external URL for keys but relies on environment variable or constant template. No obfuscated or unusual language features; the code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly fetches and caches public keys, verifies JWT signatures, and checks claims including expiration and client ID. All operations align with standard JWT validation procedures. External dependencies are used appropriately. No indicators of malicious activity or backdoors. The code's structure is clear and standard, with no obfuscated elements or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard JWT validation for AWS Cognito tokens with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly handles token verification, key retrieval, and claims validation without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
