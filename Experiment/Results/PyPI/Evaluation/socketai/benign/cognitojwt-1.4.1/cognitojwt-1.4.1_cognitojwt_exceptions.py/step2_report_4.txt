  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a single custom exception class `CognitoJWTException` inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - It includes a docstring explaining its purpose related to token verification errors.\n   - The `__all__` list explicitly exports this exception class.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for defining an exception class.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that there are no input/output operations, no data flows, no suspicious code, no anomalies, and no obfuscation.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as embedded malware, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n   - The code appears benign and serves as a typical component in a larger authentication or token verification module.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - The code is syntactically correct and follows standard Python practices.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The purpose and implementation are aligned; no issues are identified.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely defining an exception class with no external interactions, no security risk or malware activity is present.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate.\n   - The overall risk score should remain low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this snippet alone does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted here.\n\n7. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is a standard, harmless exception class definition with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nI agree with the existing assessments. No changes are needed. The code poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The risk level is negligible.",
