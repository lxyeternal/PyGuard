  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for token verification errors in Cognito JWT processing.",
  "sources": "Class definition, docstring, __all__ list",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external calls, or data flows present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python exception class with a descriptive docstring and an explicit __all__ list. It contains no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code is syntactically correct, follows best practices, and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception class with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
