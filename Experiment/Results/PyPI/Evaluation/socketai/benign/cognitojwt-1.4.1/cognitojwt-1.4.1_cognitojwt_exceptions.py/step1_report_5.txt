  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors related to Cognito JWT verification.",
  "sources": "The class declaration and the __all__ list indicating the module's public API.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single exception class inheriting from Exception with a docstring explaining its purpose. The __all__ list specifies that this class is exported publicly. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; the code appears to be part of a larger project, serving solely as a custom exception.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition intended for exception handling related to Cognito JWT issues. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
