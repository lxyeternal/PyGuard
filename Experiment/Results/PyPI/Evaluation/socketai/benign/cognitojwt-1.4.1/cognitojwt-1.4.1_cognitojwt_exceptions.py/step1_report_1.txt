  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors during Cognito JWT token verification.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code does not read input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code solely defines an exception class and an __all__ list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for defining exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'CognitoJWTException' inheriting from 'Exception'. It includes a docstring describing its purpose related to token verification errors. The __all__ list explicitly exposes this exception for module exports. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a typical, minimal Python module component for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides an exception for use elsewhere in a project. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.",
