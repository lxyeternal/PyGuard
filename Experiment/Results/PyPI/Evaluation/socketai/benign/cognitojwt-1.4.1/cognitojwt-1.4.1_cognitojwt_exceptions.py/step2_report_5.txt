  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a single custom exception class `CognitoJWTException` inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - It includes a docstring describing its purpose: to signal errors during token verification.\n   - The `__all__` list exposes this exception for module import/export.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no input/output operations, data processing, or external calls.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code itself is correct and standard for defining an exception class.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that this is a benign, standard class definition with no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty.\n   - No report suggests any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - The only potential concern could be if this exception class were used maliciously or if it were part of a larger malicious payload. However, based solely on this code snippet, there's no evidence of that.\n   - Since the code is just a class definition, it cannot be malicious by itself.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**:\n   - Given the simplicity and clarity, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n   - I would also assign:\n     - **Malware score:** 0\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n     - **Risk score:** 0.1 (since it's a benign exception class, but in a security context, even benign code can be considered slightly risky if misused; however, given the evidence, it remains very low).\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, harmless exception class with no malicious intent.\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- Confirm that the code is benign and does not pose security risks.\n\n**Note**: Always consider the broader context in the full project, but based solely on this snippet, the risk is negligible.",
