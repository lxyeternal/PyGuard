  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n**1. Code Content and Presence of Issues:**  \nThe code is a minimal class definition for `CognitoJWTException`, inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`. It includes a docstring and an `__all__` list exposing the exception class. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n**2. Logical and Structural Flaws:**  \nNo logical errors or anomalies are present. The code follows best practices for defining a custom exception class in Python. The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**3. Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activities.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \nSince all reports agree that the code is a simple, benign class definition with no malicious or security issues, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n\n**5. Evaluation of Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \nAll reports are based on the assumption that the code is solely a class definition without hidden behaviors, which is accurate. No claims about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's apparent scope.\n\n**6. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \nThe scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign exception class with no security concerns.**",
