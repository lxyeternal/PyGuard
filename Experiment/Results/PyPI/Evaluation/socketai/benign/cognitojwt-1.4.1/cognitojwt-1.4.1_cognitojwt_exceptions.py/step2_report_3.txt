  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is a straightforward class definition for an exception, with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n- All reports correctly identify that there are no vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or data flows are present.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code's purpose is solely to define an exception class, with no security concerns.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Scores:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The risk scores are all 0, indicating no security risk.\n- This is appropriate because the code is purely definitional and does not perform any operations that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- Therefore, no justification for higher risk scores is needed.\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration:**\n- All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- This is consistent and appropriate.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- No claims about potential vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores align well with the detailed analysis.\n- No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard Python exception class with no input/output, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet poses no security risk, malware threat, or obfuscation concern. It is a standard, harmless exception class definition.",
