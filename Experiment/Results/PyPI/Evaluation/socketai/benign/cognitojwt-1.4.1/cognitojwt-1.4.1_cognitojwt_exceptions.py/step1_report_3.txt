{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to Cognito JWT token verification.",
  "sources": "The code defines the class CognitoJWTException; no input data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only declares an exception class and a module export list.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, defining a simple exception class with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception class named CognitoJWTException inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The class is used for signaling errors in token verification processes related to Cognito. The __all__ list exports this exception class for external use. The code contains no input handling, no external data reading, no sensitive information, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscated elements. It appears to be a standard, minimal implementation for an exception class with appropriate documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition for exception handling in a larger Cognito JWT verification module. No malicious intent, no security risks identified.",
