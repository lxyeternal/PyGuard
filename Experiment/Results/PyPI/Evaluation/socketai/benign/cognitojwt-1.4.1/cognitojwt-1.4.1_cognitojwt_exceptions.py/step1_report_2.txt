  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors related to Cognito JWT verification.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input reading in this code fragment).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data output or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow paths, as no input/output operations are present).",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining an exception class and an __all__ list; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class 'CognitoJWTException' inheriting from Exception, with a docstring. The __all__ list exposes this exception for module exports. There are no input, output, or external interactions, nor any code that could be exploited or malicious. No suspicious or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign exception class definition for handling Cognito JWT errors. It does not contain any malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
