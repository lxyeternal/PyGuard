  "purpose": "String template for constructing AWS Cognito JWKS URLs using region and user pool ID.",
  "sources": "Placeholders '{}' in the URL string, to be filled with region and user pool ID at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None in the provided code; potential risk if placeholders are populated with untrusted input leading to URL manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input data (region, user pool ID) flows into string formatting to produce the final URL.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string template with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple URL template with placeholders for region and user pool ID. No code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The security concern depends on how the placeholders are populated; if untrusted input is used without validation, it could lead to URL injection. However, the snippet itself is benign and standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting potential misuse if inputs are untrusted. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard URL template for AWS Cognito JWKS retrieval. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The primary security consideration is ensuring that any runtime inputs used to fill the placeholders are validated to prevent URL injection or redirection. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
