  "purpose": "Define a URL template for retrieving JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) from Amazon Cognito identity providers.",
  "sources": "The string template itself, which may be formatted with specific region and user pool ID parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if user input is used to format the URL, it could lead to untrusted URL construction, but in this code snippet, no input is used directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is just a string template definition without active data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward URL template definition with placeholders for region and user pool ID.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a string template for constructing URLs to fetch JWKS data from Amazon Cognito. It contains placeholders '{}' for region and user pool ID, which are expected to be filled at runtime with specific values. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no network activity within this snippet. No suspicious or malicious behavior is indicated by this code. It appears to be a normal configuration or constant used in an authentication context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple URL template string with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any actions by itself, and there are no anomalies or hidden functions. The snippet is safe and typical for configuring access to AWS Cognito resources.",
