{
  "purpose": "Define a URL template for accessing JSON Web Key Sets (JWKS) for AWS Cognito authentication",
  "sources": "The code uses a string template with placeholders for region and user pool ID, which would be filled dynamically during runtime",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in this snippet; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling shown",
  "flows": "The URL template could be formatted with untrusted inputs (region and user pool ID), but the code does not perform any network requests or data handling itself",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the code only defines a URL template string",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple string template for constructing a URL to retrieve JWKS from an AWS Cognito endpoint. It does not include any code execution, data handling, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behavior are apparent. The use of placeholders indicates it is intended for dynamic URL generation, which is normal for authentication configurations.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard URL template for obtaining JWKS from AWS Cognito. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and typical for authentication integrations.",
