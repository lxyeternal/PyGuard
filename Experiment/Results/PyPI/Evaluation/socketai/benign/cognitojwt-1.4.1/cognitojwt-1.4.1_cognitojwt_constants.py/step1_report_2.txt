  "sinks": "Potential usage in code where this URL is formatted and used to fetch JWKS; no direct sinks shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The URL template is formatted with region and user pool ID to access JWKS data, likely used in network requests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features detected; the code is straightforward and standard for fetching keys.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a URL template string intended to be formatted with specific AWS region and user pool ID parameters to access JWKS data from Amazon Cognito. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The string itself is a standard pattern for retrieving public keys for JWT validation, which is common in authentication implementations. Without further context of usage, no malicious intent is inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a standard URL template for retrieving public keys from AWS Cognito. It does not show any malicious or suspicious behavior on its own.",
