{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'cognitojwt' for distribution, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; defines dependency lists for installation, synchronization, asynchronous, and testing requirements.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no code that processes untrusted data or interacts with external systems directly.",
  "flows": "N/A; this is a setup script that defines package metadata and dependencies without data processing or execution flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup configuration with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads a README file for long description. It specifies dependencies for various requirements, including cryptography, requests, aiofile, aiohttp, async_lru, and testing tools. The setup() function defines package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, license, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no indications of code execution, data processing, or potential malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, external connections, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
