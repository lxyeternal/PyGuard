  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, no untrusted data sinks, and no suspicious code. It correctly identifies the code as purely declarative for package configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code is a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis indicates a benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; standard setup code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also describes a typical setup script with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are straightforward `setup.py` scripts for Python packaging. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing is present.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or indirect dependencies that might introduce risks, but based on the provided code and reports, the package setup appears safe.",
