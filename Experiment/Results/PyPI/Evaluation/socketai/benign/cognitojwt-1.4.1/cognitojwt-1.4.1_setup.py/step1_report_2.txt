{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cognitojwt' Python package, configuring dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; defines dependencies in lists; uses these lists in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable operations beyond reading static files and setting dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads static long_description from file -> passes dependencies and metadata into setup() -> no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; dependencies are standard packages, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local README.md file for long description, defines dependencies for different purposes, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No code performs network connections, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
