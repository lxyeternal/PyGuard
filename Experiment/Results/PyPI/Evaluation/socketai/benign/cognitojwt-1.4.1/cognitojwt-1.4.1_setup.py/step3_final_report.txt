  "purpose": "Setup script for configuring the 'cognitojwt' Python package, defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static dependency lists; package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "Static reading of file; dependency declarations; package setup call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, declarative setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script for a Python package. It reads a local README file, defines dependency lists with common packages, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, user inputs, or suspicious patterns. All dependencies are benign, and the script performs only static configuration. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The code is typical for package distribution and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
