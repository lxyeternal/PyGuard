  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code, a standard `setup.py` script for a Python package.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- Dependencies are common, benign packages.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, declarative, and typical for package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code matches the original provided code.\n- No issues or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code does not perform any runtime operations beyond static configuration.\n- All dependencies are standard, and the setup process is conventional.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- There are no logical errors or security flaws in the setup script.\n- The report summaries are consistent and accurate.\n- No suspicious code or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. No malicious activity or code execution is observed.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0. All code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0. All reports correctly identify the script as benign.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent; no need to adjust scores.\n- The high confidence (1.0) and the unanimous malware/obfuscated scores (0) are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the analysis, the setup script is entirely benign and standard.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the absence of any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed; the package setup is secure and legitimate.",
