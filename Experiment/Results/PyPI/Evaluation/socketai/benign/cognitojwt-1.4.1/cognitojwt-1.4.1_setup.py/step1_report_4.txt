  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cognitojwt' Python package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading README content as description; defining dependencies for different feature sets.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README file, defines various dependencies, and configures package setup parameters. It does not process user input, handle untrusted data, or include code that could be exploited or used maliciously. All dependencies are standard and safe. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code structure is typical for a setup.py script and contains no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign and typical package setup script.",
