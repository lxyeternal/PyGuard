{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'cognitojwt' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description; reads dependencies from predefined lists; gathers package info for setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations with untrusted input present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted or external data; the code is purely declarative for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Uses standard setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for description and specifies dependencies and package metadata. No code execution or dynamic behavior that could be malicious is present. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved. The dependencies are common and benign, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent. The script performs straightforward configuration for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate.",
