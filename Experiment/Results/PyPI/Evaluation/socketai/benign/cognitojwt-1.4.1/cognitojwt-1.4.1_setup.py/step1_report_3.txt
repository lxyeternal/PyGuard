  "purpose": "Configure the package setup for the 'cognitojwt' Python project, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining dependency lists, and setting up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reading the file content to set long_description; defining dependencies and setup parameters; passing dependencies to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a README file, defines dependencies for different purposes, and configures package metadata. All operations are typical and secure, with no signs of malicious code or behavior. The dependencies are openly specified without suspicious URLs or commands. No user input or untrusted data is processed. The structure and content are straightforward and follow conventional setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this module.",
