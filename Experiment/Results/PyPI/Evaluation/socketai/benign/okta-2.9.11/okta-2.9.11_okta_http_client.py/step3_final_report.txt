{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous HTTP client for interacting with the Okta API, supporting session reuse, proxy configuration, response parsing, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request parameters (headers, data, json, form), environment variables for proxies, and response content from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Processes response bodies (JSON or XML), raises exceptions on errors, and potentially logs errors; no data leaks or harmful actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Request parameters are assembled from input, environment variables, and class attributes; requests are sent via aiohttp session; responses are parsed and errors handled accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. Proxy setup via environment variables is standard but could be exploited if environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard async HTTP client with proper request construction, response parsing, and error handling. Proxy configuration relies on environment variables, which is common but can be a vector if environment is maliciously manipulated. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Response parsing differentiates between JSON and XML safely. Error handling raises appropriate exceptions. Overall, the implementation appears secure and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured async HTTP client for Okta's API with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. Proxy setup via environment variables is standard but should be monitored if environment security is a concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk primarily due to environment variable reliance. The code is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
