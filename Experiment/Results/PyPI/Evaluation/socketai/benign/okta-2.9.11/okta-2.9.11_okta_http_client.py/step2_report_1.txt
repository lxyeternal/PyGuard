  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a standard asynchronous HTTP client for Okta's API.\n- No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are mentioned.\n- Proxy setup via environment variables is standard but can be a risk if environment variables are maliciously manipulated.\n- Response parsing, error handling, and request construction follow typical patterns.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.2), aligning with standard network request handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- No issues are identified in the code. The logic and implementation appear sound and typical for such SDK components.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any flaws or mistakes in the code's logic or reasoning.\n- Proxy configuration via environment variables, while standard, could be exploited if environment variables are compromised, but this is a common practice rather than a flaw.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2\n- These seem reasonable given the code's nature and lack of malicious indicators.\n- The risk score of 0.2 reflects a low but non-zero potential for misuse, primarily due to environment variable reliance.\n\n### Justification for higher risk or malware scores:\n- Since no malicious activity or backdoors are evident, scores of 0 for malware and obfuscated are justified.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering the potential misuse of environment variables for proxies, but this is a common and manageable risk.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to environment variable dependency, which is standard but should be monitored)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, well-structured async HTTP client for Okta's API. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the detailed analysis.",
