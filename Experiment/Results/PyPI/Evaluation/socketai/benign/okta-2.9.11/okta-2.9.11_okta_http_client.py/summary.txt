  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured async HTTP client for Okta's API with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. Proxy setup via environment variables is standard but should be monitored if environment security is a concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk primarily due to environment variable reliance. The code is safe for use in supply chain contexts."
