  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL manipulation, enum validation, and date-time conversion.",
  "sources": "Input sources are 'base_string' (for URL formatting), 'value' (for enum check), and 'date_time' (for date conversion). No external data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The functions return processed strings, boolean values, or numeric conversions. No sinks are evident that lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (URL string, enum value, date string) is processed through straightforward functions; no untrusted data flows to system-sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs typical utility functions without any obfuscation, misleading variables, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple utility functions: URL formatting by removing newlines, enum membership check, date string to seconds conversion, and URL splitting to produce a relative URL. All functions operate on sanitized input or standard library modules. No external or system commands are invoked, and no data is sent externally. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and do not perform any insecure or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
