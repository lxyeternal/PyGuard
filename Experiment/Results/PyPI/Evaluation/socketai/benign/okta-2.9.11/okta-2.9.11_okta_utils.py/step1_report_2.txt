{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for URL manipulation, enum validation, and date-time conversions.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include string arguments such as 'base_string', 'value', 'date_time', and 'absolute_url'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs include the returned URL strings, boolean results for enum validation, and numeric timestamps.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through string manipulation, parsing, and conversion functions to produce URL, boolean, or numeric outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual logic. The code relies on standard libraries and constants imported from a presumed safe module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions that perform straightforward operations: URL formatting, enum validation, date-time conversion, and URL decomposition. The functions use standard Python libraries and conventions. No input data is sent over a network, stored insecurely, or manipulated in a suspicious manner. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident. The functions do not include any side effects, external communication, or insecure data handling. Overall, the code appears to be benign utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic. It functions as a safe utility module for common string and URL operations. No security risks or malware are detected.",
