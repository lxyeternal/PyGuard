  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL formatting, enum validation, date-time conversion, and URL decomposition.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: multiline strings, enum values, date-time strings, absolute URLs.",
  "sinks": "None; functions process data internally without external system interaction or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through parsing, string manipulation, and validation functions without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign utility operations: formatting URLs, checking enum membership, converting date-time strings to seconds, and extracting relative URLs. No external calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The functions rely on constants and standard libraries, assuming correct input formats. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor input validation or error handling could improve robustness but do not affect security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility module with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No modifications are necessary.",
