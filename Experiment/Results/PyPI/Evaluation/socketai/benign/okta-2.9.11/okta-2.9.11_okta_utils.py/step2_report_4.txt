  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The functions are straightforward utility operations: URL formatting, enum validation, date-time conversion, and URL splitting.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present.\n- The code relies on standard Python libraries and constants, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues, benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, consistent conclusion.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, with confidence at 0.9, and a minimal securityRisk score of 0.1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a securityRisk of 0.1 seems overly cautious. No actual vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score should be lowered to 0, aligning with the other reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All agree on 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, all scores should be 0. The one slightly higher score (0.1) in report 5 is unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward utility module with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this, with all three scores set to zero.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across the reports.",
