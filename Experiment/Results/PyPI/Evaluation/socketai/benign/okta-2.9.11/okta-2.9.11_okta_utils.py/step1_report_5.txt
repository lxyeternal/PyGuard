  "purpose": "Utility functions for URL formatting, enum validation, date-time conversion, and URL manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function arguments: base_string, value, date_time, absolute_url.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data, no network connections, no file writes, and no data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through simple transformations with no external calls or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. Code is straightforward and focused on data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions with basic string processing, enum validation, date parsing, and URL manipulation. No network or file I/O occurs, and no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious intent such as code injection, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. All functions operate within expected parameters, and external libraries used are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be safe utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs simple data formatting and validation tasks with no external side-effects.",
