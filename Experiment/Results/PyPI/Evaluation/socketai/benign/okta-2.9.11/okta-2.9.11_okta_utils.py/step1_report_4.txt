{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for URL formatting, enum value checking, date-time conversions, and URL manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments: base_string, value, date_time, and absolute_url.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally; it does not write to external systems, perform network requests, or handle sensitive data directly.",
  "flows": "Input data from arguments is processed through parsing, string manipulation, and conversion functions without external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform simple data transformations and checks: URL formatting, enum membership testing, date-time to epoch conversion, and URL splitting. They rely on standard libraries and constants. No external system calls or insecure operations are present. The functions are safe, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It appears to serve standard processing purposes without any malicious or backdoor functionality.",
