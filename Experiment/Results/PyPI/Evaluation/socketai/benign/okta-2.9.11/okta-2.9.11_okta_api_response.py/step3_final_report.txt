{
  "purpose": "Handles paginated API responses from Okta, parsing JSON/XML data, managing pagination links, and providing asynchronous methods to retrieve subsequent pages.",
  "sources": "Response headers, response body, URL links in headers, external URL conversion utility.",
  "sinks": "External URL links used for pagination, response data processed internally; no data sinks or malicious data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Response headers and body are parsed; pagination links are extracted and used for subsequent requests; no malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; external URL conversion utility could be a concern if maliciously implemented, but appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for handling API responses with pagination, parsing JSON/XML, and managing external links. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security flaws are present. External URL handling is a potential vector if manipulated, but the code itself does not perform malicious actions. The asynchronous pagination logic is correctly implemented with error handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API response handler with no malicious intent or security risks. External URL handling does not indicate malicious behavior but should be trusted if utility functions are secure. Overall, the code is safe and free from supply chain sabotage or malicious payloads.",
