  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles paginated Okta API responses, parsing JSON/XML, managing links, and asynchronously fetching next pages. No suspicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering standard API handling.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in benign assessment.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code uses standard libraries and utility functions, with no signs of malicious activity. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API response handling, JSON/XML parsing, and pagination. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low, given the standard nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. The code's design and operations are typical for API response wrappers, with no malicious intent or suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard API response handler with pagination, parsing, and URL handling. The report notes that external URLs could be manipulated, but the code itself does not perform malicious actions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity identified.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, acknowledging external URL handling as a potential vector if manipulated.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes that while external links could be exploited if compromised, the code does not contain malicious logic. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard response parsing, pagination, and data handling. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with benign assessment.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is straightforward, with no malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe handling, no suspicious code, and standard libraries.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — low.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and uses standard libraries.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the low likelihood of security issues.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning. No suspicious or malicious code is present, and the code handles external data safely, assuming utility functions like `convert_absolute_url_into_relative_url` are benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.1** (considering external URL handling, but overall very low)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured API response handler with pagination support, parsing JSON/XML data, and managing external links safely. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The low security risk score is appropriate, assuming utility functions are secure and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.  \n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- No changes needed; the overall assessment is that this code is safe and free from malicious intent.",
