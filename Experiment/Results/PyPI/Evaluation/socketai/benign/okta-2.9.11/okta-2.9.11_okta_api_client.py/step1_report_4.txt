{
  "purpose": "The code defines a base class for an API client, with a method to process and transform API response bodies by converting keys to camel case.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'body' parameter of 'form_response_body', which is expected to be a dictionary representing an API response.",
  "sinks": "The code manipulates and returns a transformed dictionary; it does not interact with external systems, files, or network in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input 'body' is processed recursively, transforming keys to camel case and constructing a new dictionary; no external data flow or untrusted sink is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are observed. The code uses an imported function for string manipulation but does not perform any unusual or risky operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a static method that recursively processes a dictionary, converting its keys to camel case using the 'camel_case' function from 'pydash.strings'. It handles nested dictionaries appropriately. There are no external data sources, no system commands, no network activity, or other risky behaviors. The code is straightforward and appears to be a utility for formatting API responses without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign utility for transforming API response data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It operates solely on input data and does not interact with external systems.",
