{
  "purpose": "The code defines a base class for Okta API clients with a static method to process API response bodies by converting keys to camel case and filtering out None values.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input parameter 'body' in the method 'form_response_body'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sink points that handle untrusted data for security-sensitive operations such as file writing, network transmission, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input 'body' is processed through a recursive function that transforms keys and filters values, with no data being sent to external systems or insecure endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of 'pydash.strings.camel_case' is straightforward and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a utility to process API response data, converting dictionary keys to camel case and omitting None values. The method operates recursively, which is standard. There are no input validation issues, no external network calls, nor any suspicious code patterns. The code appears well-structured and focused solely on data transformation. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class designed for response processing without any malicious intent or security risks. It neither handles sensitive operations nor includes suspicious behaviors.",
