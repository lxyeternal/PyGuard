  "purpose": "Utility to recursively convert dictionary keys to camelCase and filter out None values in API response data.",
  "sources": "Reads input dictionary 'body' and its nested dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks; purely in-memory transformation.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary -> recursive key transformation -> output dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward recursive processing, no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that processes a dictionary by skipping None values and converting all keys to camelCase using an external utility. It handles nested dictionaries recursively. No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present. The external library used is standard and trusted. No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The logic is simple, safe, and appropriate for data normalization. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The external dependency 'pydash' is widely used and trusted, and the code does not process untrusted data in a risky way.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for formatting API response data with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
