{
  "purpose": "The code defines a base class for an Okta API client, focusing on processing and formatting API response data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'body' parameter in the static method 'form_response_body'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any clear sinks where untrusted data could cause a security issue such as data leakage or system impact.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the 'body' argument into the 'form_response_body' method, which recursively processes and formats dictionary keys, returning a transformed dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code. The code uses an external library 'pydash.strings.camel_case' but this is standard for string manipulation and not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a method to format API response data by converting dictionary keys to camelCase, recursively processing nested dictionaries. The code appears to be a utility for data normalization without any data modification, side effects, or external network interactions. There are no apparent security risks, malicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities. No untrusted input sources are directly manipulated in a risky way, nor are there any sinks that could leak data or execute harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class focused on formatting API response data. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
