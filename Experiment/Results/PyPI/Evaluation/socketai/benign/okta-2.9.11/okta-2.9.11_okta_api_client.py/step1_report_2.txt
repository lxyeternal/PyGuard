  "purpose": "A utility class for handling and transforming Okta API response data.",
  "sources": "Input data is received from an API response body, passed as the 'body' argument to 'form_response_body'.",
  "sinks": "The code manipulates the input data by converting keys to camelCase and filters out None values; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input body -> for each key-value pair -> filter and transform keys -> recursive processing for nested dicts -> return transformed result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external calls, and no hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that recursively processes a dictionary, converting keys to camelCase and excluding None values. The use of 'pydash.strings.camel_case' is straightforward and does not pose security issues. The function performs data sanitization suitable for API responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No external or untrusted sources are invoked dynamically, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for processing API response data with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely transforms input data for further use, with no evident vulnerabilities.",
