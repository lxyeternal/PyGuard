  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'okta' Python SDK package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py' file; reads long description from 'LONG_DESCRIPTION.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and long description during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks that can cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: extracting version info, reading long description, defining package metadata and dependencies. The get_version() function reads the version number from a file, which is typical. The dependencies listed are common libraries used for SDK development. No code execution, network activity, or dynamic code evaluation present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It securely manages package metadata and dependencies without any apparent security risks.",
