{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'okta' Python SDK package, defining metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from __init__.py, reading long description from LONG_DESCRIPTION.md",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is sent or executed from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Version extraction from __init__.py to setup configuration; reading long description from file to package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: obtaining version info, reading description, and defining dependencies. The get_version() function reads a version string from a specific file, which appears straightforward. No suspicious data flows, no dynamic code execution, or malicious network activity. The dependencies listed are standard libraries used in Python SDKs and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure and functions are typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified.",
