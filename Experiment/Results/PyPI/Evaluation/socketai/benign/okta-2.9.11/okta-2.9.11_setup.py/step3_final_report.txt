{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python SDK, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'okta/__init__.py', long description from 'LONG_DESCRIPTION.md', dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable leaks; dependencies are trusted.",
  "flows": "Version info flows from '__init__.py' to setup; dependencies are static; no dynamic or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; version extraction method is standard but could be tampered if source is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward version parsing and dependency listing. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The version extraction relies on reading a source file, which is common but could be manipulated if the source is compromised. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present. The dependency list is standard and trusted. Overall, the script is safe and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard, trustworthy, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk score (0.1) in some reports reflects the potential for source tampering during version extraction but does not indicate actual malicious intent. The code poses no security threat and is appropriate for production use.",
