  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup script, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious code. Dependencies are trusted, and version extraction is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the version extraction method. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The small risk score (0.1) seems to be an acknowledgment of potential tampering if the '__init__.py' file is compromised, but this is a common and acceptable approach in setup scripts.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup script, no malicious activity, dependencies are common, version extraction is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious activity, dependencies are standard, version extraction is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, standard setup, no suspicious code, dependencies are trusted.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a straightforward setup script.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation in report 2 (0.1), which is reasonable given the version extraction method relies on parsing a source file. This method is common but could be manipulated if the source file is tampered with, though this is unlikely in a trusted package repository.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The minor risk score (0.1) is justified due to reliance on parsing a source file for version info, which could be manipulated if the source is compromised, but this is a typical pattern in setup scripts.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the potential but unlikely tampering risk in version extraction)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears safe with no security issues.",
