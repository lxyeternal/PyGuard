{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the 'okta' Python SDK package, including metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '__init__.py' in the 'okta' directory; reads long description from 'LONG_DESCRIPTION.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident; no user input or external data handling within this code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code mainly performs file reading and package setup without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The method to extract version involves reading a source file and parsing a line; this is standard but slightly fragile if format changes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup with metadata and dependencies. It reads the package version from '__init__.py' by parsing a specific line, which is typical. It reads the long description from a markdown file. No code execution, network activity, or user input handling observed. The dependencies listed are common for a Python SDK package. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for package configuration.",
