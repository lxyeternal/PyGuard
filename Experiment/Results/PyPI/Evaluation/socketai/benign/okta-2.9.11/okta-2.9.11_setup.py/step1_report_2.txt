{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'okta' Python SDK package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version number from '__init__.py' file, reads long description from 'LONG_DESCRIPTION.md', and includes package files via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data or handles input/output that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The get_version() function reads the version number by parsing the '__init__.py' file; this method is standard but could be manipulated if the file contents are tampered with. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a function to extract version info from a specific file, and configures the package setup with metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All dependencies are common libraries. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The approach to version extraction is standard, assuming the '__init__.py' is legitimate. Overall, this appears safe.",
