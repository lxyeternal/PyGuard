  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script; reads version from `okta/__init__.py`, long description from markdown, dependencies listed.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flow; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Completely standard, no malicious activity, dependencies are trusted, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent, no issues. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup; reads version from `__init__.py`, long description.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Standard approach; potential concern if `__init__.py` is tampered, but no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior; dependency list is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly above zero for minor concern about version parsing).\n\n**Justification for risk=0.1:** The only minor concern is that parsing version info from a file could be manipulated if the file is compromised, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar findings: standard setup, version read from file, dependencies are common.\n- No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: standard setup, version from `__init__.py`, dependencies typical.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above; standard package setup.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no suspicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No evidence.\n- **Malware:** No evidence.\n- **Risks:** Very low; minor concern about version parsing, but this is standard practice and not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal concern about version parsing, a very conservative risk score could be 0.1, but since no actual vulnerability or malicious intent is observed, keeping it at 0 is justified.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with a standard, safe setup script. No security issues are evident.",
