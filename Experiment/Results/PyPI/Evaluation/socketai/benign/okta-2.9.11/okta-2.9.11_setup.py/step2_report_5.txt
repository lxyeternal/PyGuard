  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior. It reads version info from `okta/__init__.py`, reads a markdown for description, and specifies dependencies. No obfuscation or malware indicated.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no suspicious code, dependencies are trusted, and no data flow issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a note that the version extraction method could be tampered with if the file is compromised. Still, this is a common pattern.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — **acceptable**, given the minor potential for manipulation if the source file is maliciously altered.\n\n- **Justification:** No active malicious behavior, just a potential point of concern if the source file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; standard setup script, version from `__init__.py`, dependencies are common.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard setup script, version extraction via reading a file, dependencies are typical.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, no suspicious activity. Slight note that version parsing could be fragile but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same or very similar setup scripts. No code executes untrusted input, no network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n- **Malware risk:** None of the reports indicate malicious intent or behavior. The code is purely for package setup.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n\n- **Risk scores:** All are reasonable, with very low or zero risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it, as the setup scripts are standard and do not pose security threats.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature. No signs of supply chain attack, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Summary:** The setup scripts are standard, safe, and pose no security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I agree with them.",
