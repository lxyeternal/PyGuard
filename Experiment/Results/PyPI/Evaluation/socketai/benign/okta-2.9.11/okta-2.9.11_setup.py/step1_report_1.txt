{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'okta', including metadata, dependencies, and version extraction from a source file.",
  "sources": "File read operation for 'okta/__init__.py' to obtain version; reading 'LONG_DESCRIPTION.md' for long description; package dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits data; package dependencies could be sources if malicious, but dependencies are standard and retrieved from trusted sources.",
  "flows": "Version is read from a source file; dependencies are specified directly; no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of standard setup functions and dependency declarations.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python 'setuptools' to define package setup parameters. It reads version info from '__init__.py', reads a markdown file for long description, and specifies dependencies. All operations are typical for Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behaviors are present. Dependencies are common and from trusted sources. The code structure and logic are straightforward and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
