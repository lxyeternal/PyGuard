{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for converting strings between different casing styles, specifically to snake case and lower camel case.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings provided to the functions 'to_snake_case' and 'to_lower_camel_case'.",
  "sinks": "The functions return transformed strings; no external sinks or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed within each function with no external or untrusted data flow beyond the function scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present. The code performs straightforward string manipulation using regex and string methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that perform string casing conversions. 'to_snake_case' uses a regex to insert underscores before capital letters, then converts the string to lowercase. 'to_lower_camel_case' splits a string on underscores, lowercases the first component, then capitalizes subsequent components for camel case formatting. The code is standard, simple, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data fetching, no code injection, and no hardcoded secrets. It relies solely on standard string operations and regex, which are safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of harmless helper functions for string case conversions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on input strings with no external data handling, and it does not exhibit obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
