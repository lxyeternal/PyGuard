{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for string conversion between snake case and lower camel case.",
  "sources": "The functions take input strings as parameters, specifically the 'string' argument in 'to_snake_case' and 'to_lower_camel_case'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; no untrusted data processing or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed locally within functions; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved, and no data is sent or stored elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code performs straightforward string transformations using regular expressions and string operations.",
  "analysis": "The module contains purely utility functions for string case conversions. 'to_snake_case' uses a regex to insert underscores before capital letters, converting CamelCase to snake_case. 'to_lower_camel_case' splits a string on underscores and reconstructs it with proper casing. There are no external data dependencies, no code injection, no malicious logic, and no interaction with system resources. The code is well-structured, standard, and focused solely on string manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for string formatting utilities, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware is detected.",
