  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for string case conversions (camel case and snake case).",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "targets": "None; there are no sinks where untrusted data could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; functions operate purely on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward string manipulation functions using regex and string methods. There are no input sources such as network, file, or environment variables. No sinks, such as database operations or system calls, are present. The functions are deterministic and only process the provided string argument. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any unsafe operations or handle untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing solely on string case conversions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
