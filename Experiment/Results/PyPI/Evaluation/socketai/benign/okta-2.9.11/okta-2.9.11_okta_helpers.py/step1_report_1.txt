  "purpose": "Provide helper functions to convert strings between snake case and lower camel case formats.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'string' in functions 'to_snake_case' and 'to_lower_camel_case'.",
  "sinks": "The functions return transformed strings; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input string is split or matched via regex, then manipulated and returned; no external data flows or outputs to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No dynamic code execution, network access, or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward string transformation functions. 'to_snake_case' uses a regex substitution to insert underscores before capital letters and converts the string to lowercase. 'to_lower_camel_case' splits the input string on underscores, modifies the first component to lowercase, and capitalizes subsequent components for concatenation. Both functions are pure, simple string manipulations with no external dependencies or side effects. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, such as code injection, network activity, or credential handling, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign helper functions for string formatting, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
