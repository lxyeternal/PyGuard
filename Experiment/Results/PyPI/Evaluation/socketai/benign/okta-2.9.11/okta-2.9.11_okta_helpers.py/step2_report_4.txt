  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward string manipulation functions: `to_snake_case` and `to_lower_camel_case`.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or system interactions are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The functions use regex and string methods safely.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description; no issues or malicious activity are present.\n- The logic is sound, and the reasoning in each report is consistent.\n\n### Errors or flaws:\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the reports' reasoning or summaries.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the benign nature, 0 or 0.1 is reasonable.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is purely utility functions with no external interactions, the risk score should be very low, ideally 0.\n- The one report with 0.1 is acceptable, but overall, the risk is negligible.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware score should remain 0.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the functions are safe, which is correct given the code.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- The functions are simple, safe, and standard utility routines.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe overall security posture of this code is very high; no issues are present. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Risk: **0**\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
