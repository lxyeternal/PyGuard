{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions to convert string cases between snake_case and lowerCamelCase.",
  "sources": "The functions read input strings, primarily via function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through conversion functions without external data or untrusted sources; no network or system calls are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code uses standard regex and string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two string conversion functions: 'to_snake_case' uses regex to insert underscores before capital letters and lowers the string; 'to_lower_camel_case' splits a string by underscores, lowers the first component, and capitalizes subsequent components. Both are standard string manipulation routines with no external data sources or system effects. No obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module for string case conversion with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and free of malicious behavior.",
