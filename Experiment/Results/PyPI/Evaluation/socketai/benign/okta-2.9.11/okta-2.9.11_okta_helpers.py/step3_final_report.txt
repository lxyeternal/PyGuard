{
  "purpose": "These functions convert strings between snake_case and lowerCamelCase formats, serving as utility string manipulation tools.",
  "sources": "The functions read input strings provided as arguments to perform transformations.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the functions do not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed within each function using regex and string methods; no external data flows or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two straightforward string transformation functions using regex and string methods. No external dependencies, network activity, or system calls are involved. The logic is simple, correct, and deterministic. The functions do not handle untrusted data in a way that could cause security issues. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight elevation in one report is not justified given the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe, and the risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for string case conversions with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores in the reports are accurate; the minor security risk score of 0.1 can be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
