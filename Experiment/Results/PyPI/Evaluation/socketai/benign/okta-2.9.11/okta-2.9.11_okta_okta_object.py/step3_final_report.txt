  "purpose": "Base class for Okta data types with serialization and representation methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal class attributes via vars(self) and request_format() method.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through as_dict() serialization, with no external data input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data model with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, benign base class for data objects, handling nested objects and enums for serialization. It does not perform any external data input/output, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The use of vars(self) and request_format() is standard for data models. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The minimal security risk score in some reports appears unwarranted given the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard data model class with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the slight security risk score in report 5 should be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",
