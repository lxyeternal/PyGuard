  "purpose": "Define a base class for Okta data types with methods for representation and dictionary conversion.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly writing to external systems or sensitive data stores.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; methods operate on internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a base object with simple methods for representation and serialization. It does not perform any network communication, handle environment variables, or execute dynamic code. The code uses standard Python constructs and the aenum library for enum handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious side effects. The code appears to be a straightforward data model base class with methods for converting object attributes to dictionaries.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign base class for Okta data models, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be safe and purpose-specific.",
