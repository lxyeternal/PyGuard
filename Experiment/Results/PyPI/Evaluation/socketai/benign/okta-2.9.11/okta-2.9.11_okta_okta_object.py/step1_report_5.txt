  "purpose": "Define a base class for Okta data types with methods for representation and dictionary conversion.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and lacks hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The class provides standard methods for object representation and serialization to dict, including handling nested objects and enums. It does not perform any network operations, file access, or unsafe data handling. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign base class for data modeling with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
