  "purpose": "Defines a base class for Okta data types with methods to represent objects as dictionaries.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data or execute untrusted data paths.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no unusual code patterns, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a data model structure with methods to convert objects into dictionary representations. It does not perform any input/output operations, external data fetching, or execute code that could be malicious. The methods involve object attribute access and type checking, all standard for data modeling. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward, safe base class for representing Okta-related data objects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data structure base class with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
