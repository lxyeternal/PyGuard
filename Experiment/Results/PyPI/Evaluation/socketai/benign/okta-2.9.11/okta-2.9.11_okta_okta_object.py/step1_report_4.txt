{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for Okta data types with methods for representation and conversion to dictionary format.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class attributes and method calls, specifically in as_dict() and request_format().",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data handling is not explicitly present; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through request_format() into the as_dict() output, but no untrusted data sources are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious constructs. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for object representation and serialization. It handles nested objects and enums safely. No external data sources, command executions, or insecure data handling are present. The logic seems normal for a data model base class. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model class with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and purposeful.",
