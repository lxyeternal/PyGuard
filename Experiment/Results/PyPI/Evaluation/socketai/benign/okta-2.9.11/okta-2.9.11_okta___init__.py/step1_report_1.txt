  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only a version string; no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. It contains no input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no other complex behaviors. There are no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated code. The simplicity suggests this is a typical version declaration commonly found in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to specify the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
