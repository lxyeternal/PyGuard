  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code, input handling, or external data interactions.\n   - The code snippets are straightforward and typical for package version declarations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They appropriately dismiss any malicious or obfuscated behavior, given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate because the code is trivial and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious traits.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, there is no reason to increase these.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data handling that could pose a security risk.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is accurate.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious payload, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are present.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No modifications or concerns are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
