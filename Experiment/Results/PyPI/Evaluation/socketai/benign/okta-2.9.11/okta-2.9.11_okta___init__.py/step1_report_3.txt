  "analysis": "The code consists solely of assigning a static version string to the '__version__' variable. It does not involve any data input, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The minimal code is typical for versioning in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard for defining package version information. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
