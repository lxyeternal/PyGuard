  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of input handling, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and typical for package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments about security and maliciousness are justified given the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, this is appropriate.\n   - No justification for higher scores is needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - No malicious activity or hidden payloads are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's simplicity.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk associated with this code snippet.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- The code is a standard version declaration, common in Python packages.\n- There are no hidden threats or suspicious patterns.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and carries no security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
