  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of a static assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n   - The code is minimal, typical for package versioning.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are observed.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports aligns with this.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Risks**:\n   - The reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No logical flaws, assumptions, or questionable claims are present.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforwardness of the code.\n   - The obfuscated and malware scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Critical Observations & Recommendations**:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that this is a benign, standard version declaration.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, emphasizing the absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code snippet is entirely benign.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are justified at 1.\n\n**Final conclusion**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Security risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
