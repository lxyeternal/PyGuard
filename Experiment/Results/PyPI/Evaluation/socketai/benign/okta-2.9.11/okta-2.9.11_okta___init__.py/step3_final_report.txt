  "purpose": "Assign a benign status to a simple version string declaration in a Python package.",
  "sources": "No input or external data; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution beyond static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static string assignment to __version__, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external data interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, and confidence is high (1). There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version string declaration with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
