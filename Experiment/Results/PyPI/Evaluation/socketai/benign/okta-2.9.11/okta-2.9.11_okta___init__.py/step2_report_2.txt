  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of input handling, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code snippets are minimal and typical for package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is straightforward, this is justified.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could pose security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - All reports indicate a malware score of 0.\n   - This is correct; the code contains no malicious activity.\n   - The malware score aligns with the analysis.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they are based on static code analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n- My own assessment aligns with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0**.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- No further action needed.\n- The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|------------------|------------|\n| 0              | 0                | 0          |\n\nThis is a typical, safe version declaration with no security concerns.",
