  "purpose": "Utility class for transforming and verifying lists of OktaObject datatypes",
  "sources": "Method parameters 'collection' which is a list input",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data sinks like network, files, or external commands",
  "flows": "Input list is checked and potentially transformed into specified data_type objects",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior; no dynamic code execution or external data fetching",
  "analysis": "The class provides static methods to process lists, ensuring each element is of a specified data_type. It performs type checks and converts elements as needed. The code is straightforward, with no external data access or system modification. It neither reads untrusted input from external sources nor writes to external systems. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for data validation and transformation with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for data handling within a larger application context.",
