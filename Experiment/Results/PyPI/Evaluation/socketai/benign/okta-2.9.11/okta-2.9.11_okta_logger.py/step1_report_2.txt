{
  "purpose": "Configure logging settings for the 'okta-sdk-python' module with customizable log level and output format.",
  "sources": "The code reads the log level parameter and initializes logging handlers and formatters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted input or data flows leading to security issues.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'log_level' influences the logger configuration but does not lead to data leaks or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The logger is explicitly disabled after setup; no malicious or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging with a specified format and log level, attaches a stream handler, and disables the logger. It does not process external inputs or perform any network or file operations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The disabling of the logger is unusual but not malicious, potentially used to prevent logging until explicitly enabled elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The logger is disabled by default, which could be part of a controlled logging strategy but does not introduce vulnerabilities.",
