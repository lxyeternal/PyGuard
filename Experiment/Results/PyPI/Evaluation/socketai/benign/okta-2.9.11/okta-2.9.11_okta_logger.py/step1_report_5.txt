  "purpose": "Configure logging settings for a Python application, specifically for the 'okta-sdk-python' logger.",
  "sources": "The code reads the log level parameter (default=logging.INFO) and the 'okta-sdk-python' logger object.",
  "sinks": "The code sets up a stream handler with a formatter and attaches it to the logger; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'log_level' influences the logger's configuration; the logger writes logs via the stream handler, but no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns are present. The logger is intentionally disabled by default, which is standard for flexible logging setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging format and a function to set up logging for a specific logger. It creates a stream handler, sets its level, assigns a formatter, and attaches it to the logger named 'okta-sdk-python'. The logger is then disabled by default, preventing it from logging unless explicitly enabled later. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard logging setup code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward logging configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply prepares logging for a specific module, disables it by default, and does not handle or transmit untrusted data. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
