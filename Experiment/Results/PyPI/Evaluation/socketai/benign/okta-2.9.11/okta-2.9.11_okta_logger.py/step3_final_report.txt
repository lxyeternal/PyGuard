{
  "purpose": "Configure a logging system with a specific format, attaching a stream handler to a logger named 'okta-sdk-python', then disabling the logger.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only sets up logging components internally.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The setup flow involves creating a formatter, attaching it to a handler, adding the handler to the logger, then disabling the logger; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling the logger immediately after setup is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging configuration that creates a formatter, stream handler, and logger, then disables the logger. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The disabling of the logger is an unusual but benign design choice. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or data flows indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign logging setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The logger being disabled by default is unusual but not harmful in this context. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
