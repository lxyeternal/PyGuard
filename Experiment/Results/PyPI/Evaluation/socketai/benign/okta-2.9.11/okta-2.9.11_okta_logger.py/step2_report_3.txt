  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a logging format.\n- Implements a function `setup_logging()` that:\n  - Creates a stream handler.\n  - Sets its level based on input.\n  - Applies a formatter.\n  - Attaches it to a logger named `'okta-sdk-python'`.\n  - Disables the logger immediately after setup.\n\n**Security Perspective:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Activity:**\n   - The code is a standard logging setup.\n   - No external data is read or written.\n   - No network activity, data exfiltration, or command execution.\n   - The logger is disabled by default, which is unusual but not malicious; it could be part of a controlled logging strategy.\n\n2. **Obfuscation and Anomalies:**\n   - No obfuscated code.\n   - No suspicious constructs or anomalies.\n   - The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python logging practices.\n\n3. **Potential Risks:**\n   - The only minor point is the logger being disabled immediately, which could be used to prevent logging in production unless explicitly enabled. This is not a security flaw but a design choice.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n   - No external inputs processed insecurely.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — standard benign setup, no security risk.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard logging configuration.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.\n- The repeated reports confirm the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's straightforward nature.",
