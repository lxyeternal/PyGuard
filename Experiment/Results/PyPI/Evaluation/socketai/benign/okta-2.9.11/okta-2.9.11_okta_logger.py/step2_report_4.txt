  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it sets up logging for 'okta-sdk-python' with no external data handling.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or flaws identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk justification:** The code is benign, standard logging setup. No security risk.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is consistent with the description; no external input or data flow that could cause issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk justification:** The logger is disabled by default, which is unusual but not malicious. No vulnerabilities.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code; no external data processing or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No errors or flaws.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk justification:** No security concern; the logger is disabled intentionally.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code aligns with the description; no external data or malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk justification:** No vulnerabilities; standard setup.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is consistent with the description; no external data or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Risk justification:** No security risks; logger is disabled, which is safe.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a standard logging setup with no malicious or security-related issues. The logger is disabled by default, which is unusual but not malicious. The code does not process untrusted data, does not contain obfuscation, and does not exhibit malware behavior.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)  \n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis is a benign, standard logging configuration snippet with no security concerns.",
