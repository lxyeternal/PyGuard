{
  "purpose": "This code sets up logging configuration for a Python application, specifically configuring a logger named 'okta-sdk-python'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'log_level' parameter, which is used to set the logging level; it also accesses the 'logging' module and its methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause data leaks or security effects, as the code only configures logging behavior.",
  "flows": "The flow involves configuring a logger with a specific format, adding a stream handler, and disabling the logger. No untrusted data flows from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "The code disables the logger by default, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external network activity is involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging format and a function to set up logging with a specified log level. It creates a stream handler, assigns a formatter, and attaches it to a logger named 'okta-sdk-python'. The logger is disabled after setup, which might be intended for controlling logging output. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup without any malicious intent or security risks. The only unusual aspect is disabling the logger by default, which does not indicate malicious activity.",
