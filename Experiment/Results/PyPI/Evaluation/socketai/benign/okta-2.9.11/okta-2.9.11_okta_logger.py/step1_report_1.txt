{
  "purpose": "This code sets up logging configuration for a Python application or library, specifically configuring a logger named 'okta-sdk-python'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines functions and constants for internal configuration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or external effects; no external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are no external input or untrusted data being processed or output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors present. The logger is disabled by default, which is a standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging format and a function to set up logging with a specified log level. It creates a stream handler with a formatter, attaches it to a logger named 'okta-sdk-python', and disables the logger by default. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to be standard logging setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard, benign logging configuration without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not involve external data input, sensitive data handling, or suspicious behavior.",
