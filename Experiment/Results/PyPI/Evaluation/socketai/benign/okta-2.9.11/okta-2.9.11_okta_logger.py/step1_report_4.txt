{
  "purpose": "Configure logging for the 'okta-sdk-python' library with a specified log level and formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'log_level' parameter and uses the 'logging' module's functions to set up handlers and formatters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The code takes input via the 'log_level' parameter, applies it to the logger configuration, but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard logging setup with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a logging format and a function to set up logging for a specific logger named 'okta-sdk-python'. It creates a stream handler, sets its level, applies a formatter, adds the handler to the logger, and then disables the logger by default. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious code constructs. The setup is typical for Python applications requiring configurable logging behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging configuration module with no malicious behavior or security issues. It simply prepares logging infrastructure with no evidence of sabotage, malware, or security risks.",
