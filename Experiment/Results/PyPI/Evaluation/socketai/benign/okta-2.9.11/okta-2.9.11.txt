      "conclusion": "The setup script is standard, trustworthy, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk score (0.1) in some reports reflects the potential for source tampering during version extraction but does not indicate actual malicious intent. The code poses no security threat and is appropriate for production use."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured async HTTP client for Okta's API with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. Proxy setup via environment variables is standard but should be monitored if environment security is a concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting low inherent risk primarily due to environment variable reliance. The code is safe for use in supply chain contexts."

      "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign logging setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The logger being disabled by default is unusual but not harmful in this context. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk."
