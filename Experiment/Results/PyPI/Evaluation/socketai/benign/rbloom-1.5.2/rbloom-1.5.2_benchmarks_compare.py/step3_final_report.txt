{
  "purpose": "Benchmark performance of multiple Bloom filter implementations with large datasets (10 million items).",
  "sources": "Internal data generation within the code (floats and packed bytes).",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output; in-memory operations only.",
  "flows": "Data is added to Bloom filters and verified within the same process; no external untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several open-source Bloom filter libraries, generates large datasets internally, adds data to each filter, and verifies no false negatives occur. It handles exceptions during the benchmarking process. There are no external inputs, network activity, or system modifications. The code is straightforward, performing performance measurements solely in memory. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign benchmarking tool for Bloom filters, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, and the confidence level is high.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
