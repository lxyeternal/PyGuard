  "purpose": "Benchmarking various Bloom filter implementations for performance with float and byte data.",
  "sources": "Input data is generated within the code (integers and packed floats). No external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are directly processed or stored in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "Data is generated in loops, added to Bloom filters, and checked for membership. No external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, uses common libraries, and performs performance testing without obfuscated or suspicious code structures. No hidden or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports multiple Bloom filter libraries and performs performance tests by adding and verifying large datasets (10 million items). It handles exceptions during testing and retries with byte-packed data. All data handling appears standard, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code lacks network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration components. The libraries used are open-source and intended for performance testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a performance benchmarking script for Bloom filters, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks evident. It solely performs internal data processing for performance measurement.",
