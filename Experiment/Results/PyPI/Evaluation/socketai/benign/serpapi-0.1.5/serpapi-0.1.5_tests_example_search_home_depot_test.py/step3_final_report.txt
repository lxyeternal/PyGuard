  "purpose": "A pytest test case invoking client.search with fixed parameters to verify search results from the 'home_depot' engine.",
  "sources": "The static input parameters in the test function ('engine' and 'q'), and the external client.search method call.",
  "sinks": "The client.search method, which could process untrusted input if parameters were dynamic; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into client.search; the response is checked for errors and product data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test case with static parameters, relying on an external client object. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The input is fixed, minimizing risk. The assertions confirm expected behavior. External dependencies are assumed to be configured securely; no evidence suggests malicious intent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the static, controlled nature of the test. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
