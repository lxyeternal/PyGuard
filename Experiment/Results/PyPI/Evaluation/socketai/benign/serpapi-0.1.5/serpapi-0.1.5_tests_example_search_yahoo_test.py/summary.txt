  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test script for querying Yahoo search via serpapi. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
