  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The script is a standard `setup.py` for packaging, with no signs of malicious code. It reads version info and README, and executes shell commands for testing and uploading.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to use of `os.system`.\n- **Evaluation:** The use of `os.system` with static strings is typical for such scripts. No external inputs or untrusted data are involved. The risk is low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the potential risks of `os.system`. The main concern is that if files like `__version__.py` are compromised, malicious code could be executed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware signatures.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4 — slightly higher, reflecting the potential if files are tampered with.\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis correctly notes that `os.system` can be risky if files are maliciously altered, but in a controlled environment, this is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; the potential risk is acknowledged but minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the script is typical for packaging, with no malicious code. The primary concern is `os.system` usage.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning aligns with standard practices; no malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, with focus on `os.system` calls during build and upload processes.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis correctly notes that these commands are typical but should be used cautiously.\n\n**Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Describes the script as standard setup code, with no malicious activity. It notes the use of `os.system` for build/upload commands.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Evaluation:** The report is consistent with the code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard `setup.py` script.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malware or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Mainly concerns about `os.system`, but in this context, it's standard and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acceptable for a build script, but note that reliance on `os.system` can be risky if external inputs are introduced in future modifications.\n\n**Overall:** The code is a typical, legitimate setup script with no malicious intent. The only general caution is to replace `os.system` with safer subprocess calls in production to mitigate command injection risks, especially if future modifications involve untrusted inputs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code, and no further action is necessary beyond standard best practices.",
