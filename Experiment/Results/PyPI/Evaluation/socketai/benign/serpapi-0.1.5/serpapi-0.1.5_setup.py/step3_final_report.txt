  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, handling versioning, README inclusion, and custom commands for testing and uploading.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __version__.py, reads README.md, executes shell commands via os.system for testing, building, uploading, and git tagging.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing commands like 'pytest', 'setup.py sdist bdist_wheel', 'twine upload', and 'git' commands.",
  "flows": "Static commands executed through os.system; no untrusted input incorporated into these commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated or malicious code; reliance on os.system for command execution, which could be risky if inputs are manipulated, but commands are static.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, well-structured setup.py for Python packaging. It reads metadata, version info, and README, then defines custom commands for testing and publishing. The use of os.system is standard but warrants caution if external inputs influence commands. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the reliance on os.system, which could be exploited if external inputs are introduced or files are compromised. However, in this static context, the commands are safe. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I would set malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2, reflecting the minimal risk associated with command execution in this controlled script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard packaging script with no malicious intent. The main concern is the use of os.system, which is acceptable here given static commands. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low, and the scores should reflect that.",
