  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, scoring appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup.py for packaging, with no malicious code or backdoors. It uses os.system calls for executing commands, which could be a concern if inputs are manipulated, but in this static context, it's typical.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to use of os.system, but no evident exploitation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is typical for package distribution, with minimal security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the potential risk of executing shell commands via os.system, especially if files or environment are compromised.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — slightly higher than Report 1, reflecting the potential risk of command execution if files are tampered with.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the main risk associated with os.system. No malicious behavior observed.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the standard packaging process, with similar observations about os.system usage.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with previous reports.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the setup script, with emphasis on the use of os.system.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also describes a typical setup.py, with no malicious code, just the use of os.system.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the potential risk of os.system but finds no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.4) are justified given the use of os.system, but since no untrusted input is involved and the code is standard, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to reliance on os.system, but no active threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard packaging script with minimal security concerns, primarily the use of os.system, which is acceptable in this context.\n\n**Recommendation:** No modifications needed.",
