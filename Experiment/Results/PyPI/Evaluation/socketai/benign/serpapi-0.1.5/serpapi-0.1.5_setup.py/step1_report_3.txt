  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python client library for SerpApi.com, including commands for testing and uploading the package.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, open/read (for __version__.py), sys.executable, os.system (for shell commands), environment variables (indirectly via os.system calls).",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing shell commands ('pytest', 'setup.py sdist bdist_wheel', 'twine upload', 'git tag', 'git push').",
  "flows": "Reading version info from a file -> executing shell commands for build/upload -> tagging and pushing git tags.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for executing shell commands, which could be manipulated if input is compromised (though inputs are mostly static or from internal variables). No hardcoded credentials are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup, version management, testing, building, and uploading to PyPI. It reads version info from a __version__.py file. The commands executed via os.system are standard for packaging workflows, with no apparent dynamic or malicious inputs. The code structure is typical and clean, with no suspicious logic, obfuscated sections, or malicious intent evident. The only potential security concern is reliance on os.system, which could be risky if any variable used in commands is manipulated externally; however, in this context, commands are static or derived from internal variables. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent detected. It automates package building, testing, and uploading, which are common tasks. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks are identified.",
