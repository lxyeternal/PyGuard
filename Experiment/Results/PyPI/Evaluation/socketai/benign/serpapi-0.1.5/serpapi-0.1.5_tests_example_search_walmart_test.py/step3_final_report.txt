  "purpose": "A simple pytest test case that performs a search query on Walmart via serpapi and verifies the results.",
  "sources": "The 'client.search' method call with parameters 'engine' and 'query'.",
  "sinks": "The assertions checking 'error' in the response and presence of 'organic_results'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from the test function flow into 'client.search', which interacts with external API, then results are checked for errors and data presence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; external 'client' object is assumed to be correctly configured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test case for an API call using 'serpapi'. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The 'client' object is external, but within this snippet, it appears benign. The use of 'serpapi' is standard, and the assertions verify normal operation. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test for a search API with no malicious activity or security risks detected. The scores are appropriate and reflect minimal security concern.",
