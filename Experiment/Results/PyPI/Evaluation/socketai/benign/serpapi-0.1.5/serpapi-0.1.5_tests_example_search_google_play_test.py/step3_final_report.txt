  "purpose": "A simple pytest-based test script performing a search query on the Google Play Store via SerpApi, asserting the response contains no errors and results.",
  "sources": "The client.search() call with fixed parameters, reading response data.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on response data; no untrusted data handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to client.search(), response data to assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded parameters are benign, no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test case executing an API call with fixed parameters, performing assertions on the response. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and does not process untrusted input dynamically. Scores of malware and obfuscation are correctly zero; security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the test. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test script for the SerpApi Google Play search API. It does not exhibit malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
