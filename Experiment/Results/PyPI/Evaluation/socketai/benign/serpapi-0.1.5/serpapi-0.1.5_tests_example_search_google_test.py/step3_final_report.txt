  "purpose": "A simple pytest test function that performs a Google search via serpapi with static parameters.",
  "sources": "The client.search() method call with fixed search parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only asserts on the response data.",
  "flows": "Input from the client.search() call flows to assertions checking for errors and results.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate 'engine' key in the dictionary; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test that calls an external API with static parameters, checks for errors and results, and relies on an external 'client' object. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The external API call does not involve untrusted input, and the assertions are standard. The duplicate 'engine' key is a minor redundancy. The overall structure is typical for API testing scripts. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate given the external call but no security issues. Malware score remains 0, and obfuscation score is 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test script for an API call with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
