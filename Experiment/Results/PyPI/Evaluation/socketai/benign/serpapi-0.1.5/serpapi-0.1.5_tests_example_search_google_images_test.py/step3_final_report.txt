  "purpose": "A simple pytest test function invoking client.search() for Google Images search with static parameters.",
  "sources": "The dictionary passed to client.search() containing search parameters.",
  "sinks": "The client.search() method which performs the API call; assertions checking response data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters from the dictionary flow into client.search(), which performs network request; response data flows into assertions.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate 'engine' key in the parameters dictionary; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test case for the serpapi client, calling search with static parameters. The duplicate 'engine' key is a minor coding mistake but does not impact security or functionality. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The response is checked for errors and image results, which is standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the minor coding oversight. No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities is found. The duplicate key should be fixed for correctness but does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only issue is a minor duplicate key in the parameters dictionary, which is a coding oversight. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is safe to use.",
