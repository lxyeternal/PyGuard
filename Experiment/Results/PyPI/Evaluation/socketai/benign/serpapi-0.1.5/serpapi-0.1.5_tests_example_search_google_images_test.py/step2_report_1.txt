  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward test function invoking `client.search` with parameters for Google Images search.\n- Each report notes the duplicate `'engine'` key in the dictionary, which appears to be a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are detected.\n- The code does not perform any network communication outside the `client.search` call, nor does it handle sensitive data explicitly.\n- The `malware` scores are all 0, indicating no malicious activity is detected.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns, mainly due to the duplicate key which is a minor coding mistake.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The logic is straightforward: call search API, check for errors and results.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious behaviors.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The `malware` scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low, justified by the absence of security issues, but slightly higher due to the duplicate `'engine'` key, which is a minor coding mistake rather than a security flaw.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The `securityRisk` scores could be slightly lowered to 0.1, as the only issue is a redundant parameter, not a security vulnerability.\n- The `malware` scores are appropriate at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are correct at 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The duplicate `'engine'` key is a minor coding oversight but does not affect security.\n- The overall risk is very low.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor coding mistake, no security impact)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple, benign test case with no security risks or malicious intent. The low scores are justified, and no significant changes are necessary.",
