  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malicious potential; however, suspicious patterns like eval()/exec() and obfuscation justify elevated scores in report 2. The overall security posture is low risk, but vigilance is advised when dynamic code execution is involved. The scoring is consistent with the analyses, and no adjustments are necessary based on current information."
