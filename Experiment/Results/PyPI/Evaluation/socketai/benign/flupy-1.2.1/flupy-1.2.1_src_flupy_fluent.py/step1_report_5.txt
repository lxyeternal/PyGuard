{
  "purpose": "Provides a fluent interface for lazy and chainable iterator transformations in Python, including filtering, mapping, grouping, sorting, and other utilities.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from various iterables, including function parameters, class initializers, and internal functions like iter(), zip(), islice(), groupby(), etc.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present. No network, file, or environment variable operations are visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input iterables through chainable transformations such as map, filter, groupby, flatten, and window, with no external data exfiltration or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. No obfuscated or misleading code constructs. The code uses standard Python libraries and idioms. No dynamic code execution, system commands, or external network access are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive chainable iterator utility with functions for data transformation, grouping, shuffling, flattening, denormalizing, and windowing. It employs standard Python features, type hints, and idioms, with no signs of malicious intent. No external system calls, network activities, or secret exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's structure and function names indicate typical data processing purposes. There are no anomalies like hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, well-structured utility for iterable transformations, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any malicious payloads or behaviors that would compromise system security.",
