  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, utility-oriented iterable processing library with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the analysis. It poses minimal security concern and can be considered benign."
