{
  "purpose": "Provides a fluent interface for lazy and chainable iterable transformations and utilities in Python.",
  "sources": "Input data from iterable sources passed to class constructors or methods like range, list, or other iterables.",
  "sinks": "Methods like map, filter, reduce, and other transformations process data; no explicit sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (initial iterables) through chained transformations (map, filter, etc.) to final outputs (to_list, collect).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. The code is standard for a utility library. No network, file, or system command usage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a chainable, lazy evaluation interface similar to itertools, with methods for common iterable manipulations. It imports standard libraries and third-party 'typing_extensions' but does not invoke any network, system, or file operations. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected. No secret keys, credentials, or potential data exfiltration code present. The code solely operates on input iterables, performing transformations without side effects or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This package appears to be a standard utility for functional-style iterable processing in Python. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. All functionality is consistent with utility libraries, with no suspicious or malicious signals.",
