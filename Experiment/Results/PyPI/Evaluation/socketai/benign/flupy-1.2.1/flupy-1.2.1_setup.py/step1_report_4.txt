{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup utility for the 'flupy' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and build options.",
  "sources": "Reading variables from '__init__.py', reading README and CHANGELOG files, environment variable 'MYPYC_COMPILE', and package configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external data or execute untrusted commands are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads package metadata and documentation files, then uses this data to configure the setup process without passing untrusted data to security-sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'read_package_variable' reads variables from a file but does not evaluate or execute code, reducing risk. The environment variable 'MYPYC_COMPILE' toggles import of 'mypy.build', but this is a standard build step. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations, including version checks, reading package metadata from files, and configuring build options. The only dynamic behavior involves reading variables from files and environment variables, which is typical for setup scripts. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns identified. The environment variable check for 'MYPYC_COMPILE' and import of 'mypy.build' are standard practices for optional compilation steps, with no signs of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, safe setup script with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads configuration and metadata securely, with no external or untrusted data influencing execution in a harmful way.",
