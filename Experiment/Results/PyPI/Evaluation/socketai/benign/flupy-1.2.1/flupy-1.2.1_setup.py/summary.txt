  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The use of environment variables for optional compilation is common and not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The risk score can be slightly increased to around 0.2 to account for the optional compilation step, but it does not pose any threat."
