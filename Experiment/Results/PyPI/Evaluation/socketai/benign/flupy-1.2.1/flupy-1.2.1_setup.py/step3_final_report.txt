  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, handling version checks, reading package metadata, optional compilation, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads package variables from source files, reads README and CHANGELOG files, environment variable 'MYPYC_COMPILE' for conditional compilation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads variables from files; environment variable controls optional compilation; no external data flows or command executions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'MYPYC_COMPILE' for conditional compilation—common practice, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The environment variable for optional compilation is standard and safe. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk score reflects the optional compilation step but remains very low. All signals indicate a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The use of environment variables for optional compilation is common and not malicious. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The risk score can be slightly increased to around 0.2 to account for the optional compilation step, but it does not pose any threat.",
