  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, handling version checks, reading package variables, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading variables from '__init__.py' and 'README.rst', environment variable 'MYPYC_COMPILE', and package files for building description.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() on Python version check, file reading operations, and package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Version check -> File reading for package variables and description -> Package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'MYPYC_COMPILE' to conditionally import 'mypyc.build' and compile modules, which could be used to obfuscate code compilation. The 'read_package_variable' function reads files directly without validation, but this is standard. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: verifying Python version, reading package metadata, and configuring setuptools. The conditional import of 'mypycify' based on environment variable is intended for optional compilation but could potentially hide obfuscation if misused. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident; all operations are typical for package setup. No external data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code execution pathways are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with standard functionality. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The conditional compilation step is benign and common for optimizing package performance.",
