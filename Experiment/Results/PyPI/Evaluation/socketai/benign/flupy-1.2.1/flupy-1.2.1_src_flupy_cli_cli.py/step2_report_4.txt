  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the core security concern: the use of `eval()` on user-supplied input without sanitization or sandboxing.\n- The dynamic import syntax is flexible but not inherently malicious; the vulnerability arises when combined with `eval()`.\n- The code does not appear obfuscated or malicious in itself; rather, its design allows for potential malicious use if exploited.\n- Malware scores are consistently low or zero, which aligns with the absence of embedded malicious code in the codebase itself.\n- The security risk scores are high, reflecting the dangerous nature of executing arbitrary code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Report Analysis:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the purpose and input sources.\n- **Sink & Flows:** Identifies `eval()` as a major security concern.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correctly notes that `eval()` executes arbitrary code and no sanitization exists.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurately states the high risk due to `eval()`.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, reasonable scores. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the risk of `eval()` and dynamic imports.\n- Correctly states the lack of sanitization and the danger of arbitrary code execution.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.9, malware 0, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Focuses on the same core issues.\n- Notes that the `eval()` is risky and no validation is performed.\n- **Scores:** Security risk 0.9, malware 0.9 (this is higher than others), obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Discussion:**  \nWhile the report suggests a malware score of 0.9, the code itself does not contain malicious payloads. The high malware score seems to reflect the potential for malicious activity if exploited, not that malware is present.  \n**Adjustment:** It would be more accurate to set malware to 0, emphasizing that no malware exists in the code, but the potential for malicious use exists.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Highlights the same core vulnerability.\n- Assigns a malware score of 0.8, which is slightly higher than others.\n- **Justification:** Possibly considering the potential for malicious activity if exploited.\n\n**Verdict:** Since the code is not malicious per se, but dangerous when exploited, malware score should remain low or zero unless there's embedded malicious code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- Focuses on the risk of arbitrary code execution.\n- Malware score is 0.5, which is lower than others.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the risk but notes no embedded malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, given the absence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  The code does not contain embedded malware. The risk stems from its unsafe design, not from malicious payloads. Therefore, **malware scores should be close to 0** across all reports, perhaps 0.1 at most if considering potential exploitation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, so **obfuscated should be 0**.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  The high scores are justified due to the unsafe use of `eval()`. They can remain high (~0.9), as the risk is significant.\n\n- **Logic & Reasoning:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in identifying the core vulnerability. Slight overestimation of malware scores in some reports should be corrected.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is **not malicious** but **highly insecure** due to `eval()` on untrusted input.\n- The **malware score** should be **0 or very close to 0**.\n- The **security risk score** should stay high (~0.9), reflecting the danger of code execution vulnerabilities.\n- The **obfuscated score** remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0**             | No embedded malware, only potential for exploitation       |\n| Obfuscated      | **0**             | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation                     |\n| Security Risk   | **0.9**           | High risk due to unsafe eval usage                          |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** When reporting or scoring, always differentiate between the presence of malicious code and the potential for malicious activity due to insecure design.",
