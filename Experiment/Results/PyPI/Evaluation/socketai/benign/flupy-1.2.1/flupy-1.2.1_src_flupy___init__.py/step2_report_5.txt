  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the scores assigned, and any potential issues.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a simple set of import statements and metadata definitions.\n- No data flows, user inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are observed.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and appears to be part of a package setup or metadata module.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, consisting solely of import statements and variable assignments.\n\n- **Are the scores appropriate?**  \n  Yes. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Flaws or Logical Errors:\n\n- **In the reasoning:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They do not overstate risk or assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n- **In the scoring:**  \n  The scores are reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Correctly 0. Since there's no malicious behavior, code execution, or suspicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  Correctly 0. The code is straightforward and human-readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Correctly 0. The code does not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues.\n- The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code content.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, and I see no reason to adjust these scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate.",
