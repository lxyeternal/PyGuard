  "purpose": "This code serves as a module setup, importing utility functions and defining metadata variables for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'flupy.cli.utils' and 'flupy.fluent', and the assignment of module-level variables (__project__, __version__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, no data leaks, no network connections, and no dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not process data flows; it only defines static imports and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module with static import statements and metadata definitions. No functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No suspicious or malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
