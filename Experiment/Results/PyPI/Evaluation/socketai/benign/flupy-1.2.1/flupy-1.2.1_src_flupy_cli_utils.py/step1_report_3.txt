{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to recursively walk through files and directories, yielding file paths or directory paths.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'pathes' and 'path' which are user-supplied directory paths.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs file paths using os.path functions, but there are no dangerous or unsafe operations such as executing untrusted code, writing files, or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input paths are used as sources, then os.walk generates directory and file names, which are yielded after optional path transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. The use of external libraries 'flupy' and 'flu' is benign, assuming they are standard utility packages. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions are simple utilities for directory traversal, relying on standard os.walk. The only data flow involves reading directory structures based on user input paths. No data leaks, injections, or malicious code are present. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. The implementation is straightforward and typical for file system utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard directory traversal utility functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and free from malicious behavior or sabotage.",
