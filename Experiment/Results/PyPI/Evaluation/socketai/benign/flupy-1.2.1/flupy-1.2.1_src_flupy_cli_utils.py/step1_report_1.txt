  "purpose": "Utility functions for recursively walking through files and directories, returning paths as a Fluent stream.",
  "sources": "Reads directory paths from function arguments and os.walk inputs.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data outputs or network operations. No untrusted data processing detected.",
  "flows": "Input paths → os.walk → path joining and filtering → returned as Fluent streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple utilities to walk through files and directories, returning paths as Fluent objects. It uses standard os.walk functions without any data leaks, network connections, or malicious behavior. The functions are straightforward, with no suspicious data flows, no injection points, and no signs of sabotage or malware. There are no embedded backdoors, no hidden code, nor any suspicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for directory traversal. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard code with no indications of malware or malicious behavior.",
