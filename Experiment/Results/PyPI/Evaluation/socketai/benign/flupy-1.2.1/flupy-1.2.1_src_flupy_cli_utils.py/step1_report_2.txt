{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to recursively walk through files and directories, yielding file paths or directory paths as Fluent objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'pathes' in walk_files, and 'path' in walk_dirs. os.walk reads the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that process untrusted data; it only yields file and directory paths based on filesystem traversal.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data flows from os.walk to yield statements, with paths potentially influenced by user input if the parameters are externally controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The use of 'flupy' library for functional chaining is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: walk_files and walk_dirs. Both use os.walk to traverse filesystem directories. walk_files yields file paths, optionally absolute, based on 'abspath'. walk_dirs yields directory paths. No user input is directly processed except for the starting paths, and no external data sources or sinks are used. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage. There is no dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for directory traversal without malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious actions or contain malicious behaviors. It is safe and does not pose security risks based on this analysis.",
