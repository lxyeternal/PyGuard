  "purpose": "Filesystem traversal utilities for listing files and directories, using os.walk and the flupy library.",
  "sources": "User-provided paths or current directory; os.walk for directory traversal.",
  "sinks": "Yielded file and directory paths; no untrusted data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input paths -> os.walk -> yielded paths via flu()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward directory traversal functions with no network, data exfiltration, or code execution. It uses standard libraries and patterns, and the logic is clear. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. External library 'flupy' is used benignly for chaining. The functions only read filesystem data and yield paths, with no untrusted data processing or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for filesystem traversal with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The overall assessment aligns with the code's behavior, and no adjustments are necessary.",
