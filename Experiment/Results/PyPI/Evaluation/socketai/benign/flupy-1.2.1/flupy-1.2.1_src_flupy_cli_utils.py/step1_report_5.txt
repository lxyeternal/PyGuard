{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to recursively walk through files and directories, returning the paths as a Fluent stream.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments (pathes, path) and from the filesystem via os.walk.",
  "sinks": "Returns file and directory paths; no direct sink for untrusted data that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "User provides directory paths -> os.walk generates directory and file paths -> functions yield paths as Fluent streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No external network access or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: walk_files and walk_dirs. Both functions use os.walk to traverse file system directories and yield paths as Fluent objects. The walk_files function optionally returns absolute or relative paths based on the 'abspath' parameter. The walk_dirs function yields directory paths. There are no inputs from external sources beyond user-specified paths, and no outputs that could leak data or execute malicious actions. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The functions are straightforward utility methods for filesystem traversal with no embedded malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides safe, utility-based directory and file traversal functions with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and intended solely for file system navigation.",
