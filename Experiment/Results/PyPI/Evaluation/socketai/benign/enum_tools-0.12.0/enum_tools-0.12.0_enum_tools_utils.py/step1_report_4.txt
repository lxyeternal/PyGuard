{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for working with Python enums and class hierarchies, including type checks and introspection.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own class definitions, import statements, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code inspects class hierarchies and type objects; no flow involves untrusted input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code is standard utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The script defines protocols and functions to check enum types, enum members, and flags, along with a function to retrieve the base class of enum members. It uses standard library modules such as inspect and enum, with type annotations and type checks. The logic is straightforward, involving isinstance checks and class hierarchy inspections. There is no evidence of data leaks, code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical utility module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module intended for class and enum introspection. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low, with no suspicious activity detected.",
