{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for working with Python Enums, Protocols, and class hierarchies.",
  "sources": "Import statements (inspect, enum, typing, typing_extensions); functions that operate on classes and types.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data influences critical operations; no network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (types, class objects) flow through functions like is_enum, is_enum_member, is_flag, get_base_object, but only for type inspection.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. Use of inspect and type checks is standard for such utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines protocols and functions for introspection of Enum types and class hierarchies. It checks for Enum, Flag, and MRO properties. All operations are standard type and class attribute checks. No untrusted data handling, no network activity, and no code execution based on dynamic input. The code is consistent with its utility purpose. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for enum and class introspection with no malicious intent. It uses standard library features appropriately. There is no evidence of malware or malicious code present.",
