  "purpose": "Utility functions for inspecting Python enum classes, enum members, flags, and class hierarchies.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their inheritance hierarchies, inspect.getmro() calls, type checks on classes and enum members.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs static introspection without processing untrusted data or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "The functions analyze class hierarchies and types via inspect.getmro() and isinstance() checks, with no data flow involving external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries. The is_flag() function's logic may not correctly identify subclasses of Flag, but this is a correctness issue, not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for class and enum introspection, relying solely on static type and hierarchy checks. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The functions are correctly implemented for their purpose, with a minor note that is_flag() might not accurately detect subclasses of Flag, but this does not impact security. All signals indicate benign, standard utility code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for enum and class hierarchy inspection, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
