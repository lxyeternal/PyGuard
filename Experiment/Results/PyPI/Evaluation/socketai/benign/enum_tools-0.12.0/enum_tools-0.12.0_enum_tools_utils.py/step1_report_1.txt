{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for working with Python enums and protocols, including type checks and class introspection.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (inspect, enum, typing, typing_extensions). No external input sources or data read operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the functions perform static type and class introspections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to common patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for type checking of Enum, Flag, and classes with MRO. It uses standard introspection tools (inspect, isinstance) without any dynamic execution or data handling. No external input, network operations, or security-sensitive processing is observed. The functions perform static type analysis and class hierarchy checks, which are safe and typical for utility modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended as a utility module for enum and class introspection, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
