{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for handling and inspecting Python enum classes and related types.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries (inspect, enum, typing) and third-party typing_extensions. No input data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or outputs from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The functions operate solely on provided class/type objects; no untrusted data flow or external communication is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. All functions are standard and intended for type inspection. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions to check if objects are enum types or members, and to retrieve base object types. It employs standard Python features and third-party typing extensions. No external input handling, network communication, or dangerous operations are present. The functions focus on introspection and type checking. The code appears clean, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code for enum type inspection with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or supply chain threats.",
