  "purpose": "Utility functions for inspecting and identifying enum types and class hierarchies.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (`inspect`, `enum`, `typing`) and third-party (`typing_extensions`). No input data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines protocols and functions to determine enum types, members, and flags, as well as retrieving the base object of enum members. It uses standard introspection (`inspect.getmro`) and type checks (`isinstance`). No external data processing, network activity, or execution of untrusted data is present. The code appears to be a standard utility module without malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for enum and class hierarchy inspection. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
