{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom subclasses and utilities for Python's enum module, enhancing enum functionality such as member iteration, ordering, and type restrictions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, enum, and typing modules; uses sys.version_info for version-specific logic.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily defines classes and functions without external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution, and no network or file operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly provides class definitions that extend enum capabilities with type restrictions, iteration support, and ordering. Conditional logic based on Python version appears standard and safe. No use of external inputs, environment variables, or network operations. The commented-out methods and import patterns are typical and do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for utility enhancement without any signs of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, utility-focused extension of the Python enum module. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use and appears to be part of a larger project aimed at improving enum functionalities.",
