{
  "purpose": "Defines custom subclasses and utilities for enum types in Python, enhancing functionality and compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports standard library modules (sys, enum, typing); no external or user input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data handling or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code primarily defines classes and functions for enum enhancements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of internal enum functions (_high_bit, _decompose) is standard for Python version compatibility. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of class definitions extending enum functionality and version-specific compatibility code. It imports standard modules, performs no I/O, network, or system modification operations. The use of internal enum functions is consistent with normal library practices. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be well-structured, purpose-specific, and without hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, purpose-built extension of Python's enum module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only enhances enum capabilities and maintains backward compatibility, with no indicators of malicious activity or supply chain attacks.",
