{
  "purpose": "Defines custom subclasses and utility functions for Python's enum module to enhance functionality, compatibility, and usability of enum types.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (sys, enum, typing), and class/method definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Code primarily consists of class definitions and utility functions with no runtime data flow involving external inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code extends Python's enum capabilities with subclasses and functions to support features like member iteration, ordering, and automatic numbering. It includes compatibility code for different Python versions, notably handling enum decomposition and attributes. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious data handling are observed. All code appears to be standard library augmentation and documentation of enum subclasses.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign library extension for enum classes, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is well-structured, with no suspicious external interactions or hidden functionalities.",
