{
  "purpose": "The code provides custom subclasses and utility functions for Python's enum module, including version compatibility and extended iteration capabilities.",
  "sources": "Internal enum class methods, version-dependent internal functions, and standard library imports; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external data handling, network activity, file I/O, or environment variable access; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves defining classes and functions without external data input or output, primarily internal logic and class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of subclass definitions for Enum, IntEnum, StrEnum, and related classes, with conditional logic based on Python version for internal enum functions. It includes utility classes for iteration and ordering, all implemented with standard practices. There are no external data interactions, network calls, or obfuscation. The internal functions used are standard and for compatibility, not malicious. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused extension of Python's enum module, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
