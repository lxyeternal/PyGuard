{
  "purpose": "Defines custom subclasses and utilities for Python's enum module, including various enum types with additional features like ordering, iteration, and automatic numbering.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, enum, and typing modules; uses sys.version_info to determine Python version; defines functions and classes that do not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network or file operations, no environment variable access, no user input or output.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from external sources to sinks, as the code primarily defines classes and utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only potentially noteworthy behavior is the conditional import and use of internal enum functions depending on Python version, but these are standard internal methods, not malicious. The code is well-structured with no obfuscation or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides extended enum classes with additional features for Python 3.10+ and earlier versions, implementing custom iteration, ordering, and automatic numbering. It imports standard modules, performs version checks, and defines multiple enum subclasses. No external data sources, user input, or system commands are invoked. No network, file, or environment variable access occurs. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured library code intended for enhancing enum capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of enum class extensions with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely defines utility classes and functions without external interactions or vulnerabilities.",
