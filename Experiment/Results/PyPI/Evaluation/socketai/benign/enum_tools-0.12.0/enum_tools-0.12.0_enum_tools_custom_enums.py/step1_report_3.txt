{
  "purpose": "Define custom subclasses and extensions of Python's enum module to enhance functionality and compatibility across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, enum, and typing modules; standard library functions and attributes; class definitions and methods within the script.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior, external systems, or sensitive data flows.",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines classes and functions with no data flow from external input to sensitive operations or output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility classes for enum types, version-dependent implementations, and extended iteration capabilities. It relies solely on standard library modules and implements class methods for enum enhancements. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code injections. The code is well-structured, with clear licensing and no suspicious external interactions. The only conditional logic depends on the Python version, which is standard for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured library for enum extensions without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
