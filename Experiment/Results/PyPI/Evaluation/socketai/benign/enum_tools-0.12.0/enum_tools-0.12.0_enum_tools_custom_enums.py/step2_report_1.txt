  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, utility-focused, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Code review:** The code defines custom enum subclasses, version-dependent logic, and utility functions. All are standard practices for extending enum capabilities.\n- **Potential issues:** No external inputs, no network or file operations, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution.\n- **Risk scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (due to the extension nature, but still very low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a benign extension of enum functionalities.\n- **Code review:** Same as above, no external data handling, no suspicious logic.\n- **Potential issues:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also finds the code benign, standard library extension, no malicious intent.\n- **Code review:** Uses internal enum functions conditionally, which is standard for compatibility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Code review:** No external data sources, no I/O, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Benign, purpose-specific extension, no malicious signs.\n- **Code review:** Uses internal enum functions appropriately, no external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is purely utility and extension code for enum classes.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low, but some are at 0.5 or 0.1.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all cases, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose as a benign utility library, a risk score of 0.1 to 0.2 might be more appropriate than 0.5, but 0.5 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (more precise than 0.5, but the existing scores are acceptable).\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the current risk scores are reasonable but could be slightly lowered to reflect the benign nature more accurately.",
