{
  "purpose": "The code defines several enumeration classes with documentation annotations for use in a larger system, primarily for representing people and status flags.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from enum class definitions and class methods; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present. No output or untrusted data handling is observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the methods simply return internal data structures (iterators, lists).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be standard enum declarations with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python enum definitions with added documentation annotations. There are no suspicious code behaviors, external data handling, or malicious patterns. Methods are simple and intended for internal use, with no indication of data exfiltration or malicious intent. The code includes benign docstrings, inline comments, and no obfuscated or dynamically executed code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate enumeration definitions with documentation, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not demonstrate any suspicious activity.",
