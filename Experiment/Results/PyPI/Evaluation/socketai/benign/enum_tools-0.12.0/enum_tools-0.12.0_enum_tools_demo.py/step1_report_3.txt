{
  "purpose": "Define several enumerations with documentation, including people, status flags, and variants with no methods or member documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library and a third-party package 'enum_tools.documentation'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines enums and attaches documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present. Usage of 'enum_tools.documentation' for documentation annotation is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple enum classes with associated documentation and methods, using third-party documentation tools. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations are present. The only third-party import is for documentation purposes, which does not introduce security risks. No dynamic execution, network activity, or credential handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign enumeration definition with documentation annotations. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is detected.",
