{
  "purpose": "Defines several enumeration classes with documentation annotations for clarity and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The enum classes and their class methods, which provide enum values and lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static enum definitions with no external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static enum class definitions using Python's enum module, with documentation annotations from a third-party package. No dynamic code execution, input/output, network, or file operations are present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. The code's purpose appears to be for documentation and code clarity. All classes and methods are standard, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The use of documentation annotations is benign and solely for documentation purposes. The code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured enumeration module intended for documentation purposes. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The current scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a minor adjustment recommended for report 2's risk score to be set to 0 for consistency.",
