  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the underlying code to assess potential security risks, malware presence, obfuscation, and consistency of scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward set of enum class definitions, primarily for documentation purposes.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n- Usage of `enum_tools.documentation` is for documentation annotations, not malicious behavior.\n- Methods are simple and static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines enums with documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Analysis:** Fully benign, no suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar enum definitions with documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) despite no suspicious activity. This may be due to the use of third-party documentation tools, but it's likely an overestimation.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score should probably remain at 0, as there's no evidence of security concern.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Enum classes with documentation annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with benign code.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Enum definitions with documentation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Enum classes with documentation annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Key points:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** For reports 1, 3, 4, 5, 0 is justified. For report 2, a 0.1 risk score seems unjustified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Adjust the risk score of report 2 to 0**, aligning with the other reports and the code analysis.\n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0** across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                 | 0          |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                 | 0          |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                 | 0          |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                 | 0          |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                 | 0          |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign set of enum class definitions with documentation annotations. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The only minor correction is to lower report 2's risk score to 0 for consistency.",
