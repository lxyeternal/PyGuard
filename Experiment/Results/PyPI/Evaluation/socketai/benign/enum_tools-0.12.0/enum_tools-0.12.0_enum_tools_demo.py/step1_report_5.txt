{
  "purpose": "Define several enumeration classes with documentation annotations for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum, typing, and enum_tools.documentation; class definitions; class attributes and methods.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data being sent to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; class attributes are hardcoded constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. Usage of decorators and class methods is standard. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines enumerations with documentation and helper methods. There are no external input sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The only notable activity is setting a documentation flag in the enum_tools package. The class methods simply return enum values or lists, which is normal. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign enumeration module with documentation support. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this fragment.",
