{
  "purpose": "Defines several enumeration classes for use with enum_tools.documentation, including examples with various docstring and method configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports enum, typing.List, and enum_tools.documentation; class definitions with hardcoded enum values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no output functions, no network or file operations, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly defines static enums and class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Use of docstrings and enum values appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple enum classes with hardcoded values, including methods for iterating over enum members and converting to list. No input handling, no output, no network or system calls. Usage of enum_tools.documentation suggests documentation generation. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign enum class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
