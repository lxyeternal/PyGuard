{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions to extract and add documentation strings to enum members in Python source code by parsing comments and docstrings.",
  "sources": "The code reads source code of enum classes and members using inspect.getsource, parses it with ast, and tokenizes lines with the tokenize module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted external data or write data externally. The code mainly reads source code and comments, with no network or file output based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The source code is retrieved via inspect.getsource, parsed into AST, tokens are generated, and comments or docstrings are extracted and assigned to enum members. No external data flow or command execution is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code relies on standard libraries and well-defined procedures to parse and assign docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically processes Python source code to extract docstrings from comments or inline strings, then assigns them to enum members' __doc__ attributes. It uses standard parsing and tokenization techniques without any suspicious behaviors. There are no network calls, code injections, or data leaks; all operations involve source code introspection and manipulation. The code appears to be intended for documentation enhancement and does not contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign utility for extracting and attaching documentation to enum members via comments and docstrings. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
