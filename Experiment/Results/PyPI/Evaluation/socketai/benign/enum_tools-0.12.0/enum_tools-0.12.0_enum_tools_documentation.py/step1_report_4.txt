{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions to parse Python enum classes and members, extracting docstrings from comments or string literals for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source code via inspect.getsource, processes source lines with regex and tokenization, and retrieves source code from enum members.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that send untrusted data over network, modify files, or perform other harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "Sources (inspect.getsource, source string parsing) do not lead to any data being sent or executed in an unsafe manner; no flow to malicious sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. Usage of third-party libraries (pygments) is benign and common for syntax highlighting or tokenizing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static analysis and documentation enhancement by parsing source code and comments. No runtime code injection, network communication, or malicious behavior is detected. The functions operate on source strings, tokens, and AST nodes in a standard manner, without any hidden or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a documentation utility that extracts docstrings from comments and string literals for enum members. It does not contain malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks in the provided code.",
