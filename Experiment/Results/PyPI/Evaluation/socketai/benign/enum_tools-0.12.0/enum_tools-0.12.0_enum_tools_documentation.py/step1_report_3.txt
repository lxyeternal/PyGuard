{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and functions for extracting and adding docstrings to enum members in Python source code, primarily for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads source code of enum classes and members via inspect.getsource, and also processes code lines for tokens and comments.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns __doc__ attributes to enum members and classes, and retrieves source code for inspection.",
  "flows": "Source: inspect.getsource or reading source code lines -> Parsing with ast or tokenization -> Assigning docstrings to enum members via __doc__ attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious backdoors. It performs source parsing and docstring management without any network activity, file modification, or external data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static source analysis and documentation augmentation for enum classes. It tokenizes lines, extracts comments, and assigns docstrings, all within the context of source code inspection. There are no indications of network communication, system modifications, or malicious intent. The only potentially suspicious aspect might be the use of inspect.getsource to retrieve source code, but this is standard for debugging or documentation tools. Overall, the code lacks any behavior that would suggest malware or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a documentation utility for enum classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors. Its purpose is purely static source analysis and docstring management.",
