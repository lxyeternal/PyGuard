{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and utility functions for extracting and attaching docstrings to enum members in Python source code, mainly for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source code using inspect.getsource() for enum classes and members, and parses tokens from lines of code using tokenize and pygments.",
  "sinks": "Uses eval-like mechanisms indirectly via inspect.getsource(), but does not execute untrusted code; no sinks that process untrusted data into system or network operations.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading source code of enum classes/members via inspect; Flow: Parsing source tokens with get_tokens and parse_tokens; Attaching docstrings to enum members and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code mainly manipulates docstrings and source parsing. No dynamic execution or network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily analyzes and manipulates Python source code and AST to extract or attach docstrings to enum members. It employs standard modules like inspect, ast, and tokenize. There are no network, file operations, or malicious payloads. No suspicious obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. The functions are designed for documentation enhancement, with thorough handling of different comment styles. No anomalies indicating malicious intent were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting and attaching documentation to enum members in Python source code. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely on source code parsing and docstring management, with no network, file, or external system interactions.",
