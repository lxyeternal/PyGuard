{
  "purpose": "This module provides tools to extend Python's enum module, including custom enum classes and documentation helpers.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, specifically 'enum' from the standard library and 'enum_tools' package components.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly defines imports, constants, and an __all__ list.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard imports, constant definitions, and an __all__ list; no suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports standard and local modules, defines metadata constants, and specifies the public API via __all__. There are no input handling, no network operations, no evaluation of untrusted data, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a typical __init__.py file for a Python package, primarily for organizing exports and metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious behavior detected. It solely sets up imports and public interface exposure. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
