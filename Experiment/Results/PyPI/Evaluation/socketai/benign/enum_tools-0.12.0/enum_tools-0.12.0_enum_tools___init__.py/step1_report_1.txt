{
  "purpose": "To provide tools and extensions for Python's enum module, including custom enum classes and documentation functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements: from enum module and internal package modules (enum_tools.custom_enums and enum_tools.documentation).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data interactions detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly defines imports, constants, and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The __all__ list is straightforward. All variables are standard metadata strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package. It imports standard library enum classes and internal modules, defines metadata variables, and an __all__ list for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The package appears to be well-structured for its purpose of extending enum functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package initializer for a library that extends enum capabilities. It contains no malicious or suspicious code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
