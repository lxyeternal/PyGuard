{
  "purpose": "Provide tools to extend Python's enum module with additional features and documentation capabilities.",
  "sources": "None; all data is either hardcoded or imported from standard libraries and local modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up imports, constants, and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard library modules and local modules, sets module-level metadata variables, and defines the __all__ list for exports. It is a straightforward package initializer with no dynamic code execution, no external inputs, or suspicious behaviors. There are no sources or sinks related to untrusted data. All components are typical for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
