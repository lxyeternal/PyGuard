  "purpose": "Standard package initializer (__init__.py) for a Python module extending enum functionality, importing standard and internal modules, and defining metadata and exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, package metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, etc.), no external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "None; no external communication, data processing, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to typical package setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static __init__.py file importing standard library and internal modules, defining package metadata, and setting __all__. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is purely to set up the package namespace. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and justified, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
