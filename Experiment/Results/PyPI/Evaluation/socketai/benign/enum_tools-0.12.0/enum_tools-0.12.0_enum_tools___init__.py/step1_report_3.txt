{
  "purpose": "To provide tools that extend Python's enum module with additional functionalities and documentation features.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__author__, __copyright__, __license__, __version__, __email__), and import statements for standard and custom modules.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input handling, data transmission, or resource access points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; only static imports and variable assignments are used.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard for an __init__.py module.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes module metadata, imports standard enum classes, and custom enum tools. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or secret handling is present. The __all__ list explicitly exports the relevant symbols, indicating an organized package structure. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign __init__.py file setting up a package with enum extensions and documentation utilities. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
