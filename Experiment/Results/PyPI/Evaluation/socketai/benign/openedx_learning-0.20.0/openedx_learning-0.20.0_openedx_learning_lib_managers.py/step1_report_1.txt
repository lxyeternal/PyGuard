{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Django ORM manager that automatically applies select_related to optimize database queries involving related models.",
  "sources": "The __init__ method receives a list of relation strings; get_queryset method calls select_related with these relations.",
  "sinks": "The get_queryset method's select_related could potentially be manipulated if the relation strings are dynamically sourced from untrusted input, but here they are provided during initialization.",
  "flows": "Relations provided during initialization are stored in self._relations and used directly in get_queryset to influence database queries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present. The code simply extends Django ORM behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model manager that enhances query performance by prefetching related models via select_related. The constructor accepts a list of relation strings, which are stored and later used in get_queryset. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The implementation appears to be a standard extension of Django's ORM capabilities, aimed at optimizing database access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured custom Django ORM manager designed to improve query efficiency. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
