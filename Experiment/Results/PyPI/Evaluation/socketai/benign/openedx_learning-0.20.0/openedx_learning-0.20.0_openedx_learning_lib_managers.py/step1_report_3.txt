  "purpose": "Define a custom Django ORM manager that automatically adds select_related to optimize database queries involving related models.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__) accepts relations as input; get_queryset method calls select_related with stored relations.",
  "sinks": "The get_queryset method calls select_related, which modifies the database query to include related objects; no untrusted data or external systems involved.",
  "flows": "Relations passed during initialization flow into get_queryset, which applies select_related with these relations to the queryset.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code appears to follow standard Django practices for custom managers. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django ORM manager to streamline queries involving related models by automatically applying select_related. The constructor stores relation paths, and get_queryset uses these to optimize database access. There are no evident security risks, malicious behaviors, or anomalies. The code's purpose is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django custom manager for improving query efficiency with related models. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues. Overall, it is safe and well-structured.",
