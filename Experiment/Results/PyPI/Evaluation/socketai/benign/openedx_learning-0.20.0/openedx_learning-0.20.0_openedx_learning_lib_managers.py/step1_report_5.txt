{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Django ORM manager to optimize database queries by automatically including related models via select_related.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) takes a list of relation strings; get_queryset method calls select_related with these relations.",
  "sinks": "The get_queryset method applies select_related, which could potentially include untrusted relation names if they are dynamically supplied from untrusted sources, but in this code, relations are passed during initialization, likely from trusted code.",
  "flows": "Relations passed during initialization are stored in self._relations and used in get_queryset to modify the queryset with select_related.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard Django practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django manager that predefines related models to optimize queries. The constructor stores relation strings, and get_queryset applies select_related with those relations. There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources at runtime; the relations are set at class instantiation. The code does not perform any malicious operations, data leaks, or contain hidden behaviors. It is a standard pattern for performance optimization in Django models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django ORM manager for optimized related data fetching. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is a well-structured, safe utility class.",
