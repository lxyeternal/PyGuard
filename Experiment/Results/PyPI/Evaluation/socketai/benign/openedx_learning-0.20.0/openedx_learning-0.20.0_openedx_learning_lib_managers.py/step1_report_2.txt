  "purpose": "Define a custom Django ORM manager to automatically include specified related objects in queries via select_related.",
  "sources": "Initialization of the manager with a list of relation strings, get_queryset method calling select_related with these relations.",
  "sinks": "get_queryset method applying select_related; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Relations provided during manager instantiation flow into get_queryset, which uses them to modify the query.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious external calls or data leaks, no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django model manager that enhances query performance by automatically including related objects. The constructor accepts relation names, stored internally, and the get_queryset method applies select_related with these relations. The implementation is straightforward, utilizing Django ORM features without any external inputs, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django ORM utility class designed for performance optimization. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and legitimate.",
