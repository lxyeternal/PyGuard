  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's nature, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the module as a re-export hub for API functions, with imports from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or data handling, only import and export.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard imports are justified due to `__all__` declarations; no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is benign, serving as an API facade.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; re-exporting functions from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External code consumes this module; potential for untrusted input exists, but the code itself doesn't process data.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard imports are a concern but justified here.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The analysis correctly states no malicious patterns, just import aggregation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 — justified as minimal, given the use of wildcard imports but explicitly justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous; re-exporting API functions, no data processing.\n- Wildcard imports are justified due to `__all__`.\n- No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (justified)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern: import aggregation, aliasing for backward compatibility.\n- Wildcard imports justified, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous analyses; API aggregator, no data handling.\n- Wildcard imports justified by `__all__`.\n- No suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (justified)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to wildcard imports, but justified given the explicit comments and use of `__all__`.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code is a typical API facade with safe practices, and no malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear import statements, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, primarily due to the use of wildcard imports, but justified by the context.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code snippet.",
