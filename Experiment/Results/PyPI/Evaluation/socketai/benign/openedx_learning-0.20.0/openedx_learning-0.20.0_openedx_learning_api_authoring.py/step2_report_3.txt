  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Re-export API functions, no suspicious activity.  \n- Sources: Imports from internal modules; no untrusted data.  \n- Flows: No data flow; just import and alias.  \n- Anomalies: Wildcard imports justified by __all__.  \n- Analysis: Safe, straightforward.  \n- Conclusion: Benign, no risks.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: API re-export for external use.  \n- Sources: Imports from internal modules with wildcard.  \n- Sinks: Functions could be invoked with untrusted data, but no direct handling here.  \n- Flows: External code may invoke imported functions; no direct data flow in this module.  \n- Anomalies: Wildcard imports can obscure functions but justified.  \n- Analysis: No malicious patterns; just import and re-export.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, minimal risk.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable, given the slight concern about obscurity.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: API aggregator.  \n- Sources: Imports with wildcard.  \n- Sinks: Re-exported functions, no data handling.  \n- Flows: No direct data flow.  \n- Anomalies: Wildcard imports justified.  \n- Analysis: No suspicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Standard pattern, safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: API re-export, backward compatibility.  \n- Sources: Imports with wildcard.  \n- Sinks: Re-exported functions.  \n- Flows: No data flow.  \n- Anomalies: Wildcard imports justified.  \n- Analysis: No malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: API aggregator.  \n- Sources: Wildcard imports justified by __all__.  \n- Sinks: No direct data handling.  \n- Flows: No explicit data flows.  \n- Anomalies: Wildcard imports justified.  \n- Analysis: No suspicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; wildcard imports are justified and explicitly documented.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the code's nature—primarily import/export setup without data processing or network activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- The use of wildcard imports, while generally discouraged, is explicitly justified here and does not indicate malicious intent.  \n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation; wildcard imports are documented and justified.  \n- **Risk:** 0 — minimal risk, as the code is purely an API facade with no data handling or network activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard for API aggregation, with no security concerns. The existing scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
