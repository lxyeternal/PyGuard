{
  "purpose": "This module re-exports API functions from various authoring app modules for public use, facilitating content authoring operations in Learning Core.",
  "sources": "Imports from multiple internal api modules within the 'apps.authoring' package, and a renaming of a function.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no untrusted input sources or dangerous data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and re-exports functions, and performs a simple alias assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports, which could obscure imported functions but are justified by __all__ declarations. No malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports and an alias assignment for a function. It avoids executing untrusted data or performing network operations. Wildcard imports are explicitly permitted due to __all__ declarations, minimizing risks. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. Overall, it is a straightforward module setup without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a centralized API interface with safe import practices. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
