  "purpose": "To serve as a public API module that re-exports functions from various authoring API modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ..apps.authoring.collections.api, ..apps.authoring.components.api, ..apps.authoring.contents.api, ..apps.authoring.publishing.api, ..apps.authoring.units.api; definition of create_next_version.",
  "sinks": "Re-exported functions and create_next_version alias, which may internally call other functions or access data; no direct untrusted data handling in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Imports bring in functions and variables; create_next_version is an alias for create_next_component_version, potentially calling underlying API functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can obscure what specific functions are imported; however, this is documented and explicitly allowed by comments. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily import statements and a variable alias. Wildcard imports are used but are justified and explicitly permitted. No data processing, input handling, or suspicious behavior observed. No obfuscated or malicious code structures. The module functions as a straightforward API aggregator.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API aggregation module, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is to re-export functions for external use, and it does not handle untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.",
