{
  "purpose": "This module serves as a centralized API facade for content authoring in Learning Core, re-exporting functions from various internal API modules to provide a unified interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules within the 'apps.authoring' package, utilizing wildcard imports and aliasing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; the module only imports and re-exports functions, with no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "External code invokes the imported functions; however, within this module, there are no data flows or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports justified by the presence of '__all__' in imported modules; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API aggregator, importing multiple internal modules with wildcard imports, which are justified due to '__all__' declarations. The alias assignment is benign. No data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The wildcard imports could obscure the imported functions but are explicitly justified, reducing concern. No malicious patterns or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a clean API aggregation layer with justified import practices. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
