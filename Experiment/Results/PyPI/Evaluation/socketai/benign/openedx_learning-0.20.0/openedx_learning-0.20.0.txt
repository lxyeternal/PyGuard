      "conclusion": "The critical security concern is the use of exec() on untrusted input, which justifies a high malware score of 0.9. Other reports, lacking code or suspicious patterns, are correctly scored with low malware and risk levels. The overall assessment confirms that the dependency does not exhibit malicious behavior except for the identified exec() pattern, which poses a severe security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Django ORM utility designed for query optimization. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The only potential issue is the lack of validation of relation strings, which could cause runtime errors or be exploited if relation strings are maliciously crafted. This does not constitute malicious behavior but warrants caution if relation strings are dynamically sourced from untrusted inputs."
