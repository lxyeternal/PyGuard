  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for Django Admin interface customization, including read-only admin and related object display.",
  "sources": "Django framework imports, model object attributes, URL reversing, HTML formatting functions, model metadata, related object introspection.",
  "sinks": "HTML output via format_html and format_html_join, URL generation with reverse.",
  "flows": "Related object attributes are fetched via getattr; URLs are generated for related objects; HTML is formatted for display in admin interface.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of reverse for URL generation is standard. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious payloads. The code mainly creates safe HTML for admin display.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a read-only admin interface subclass and a utility function for displaying 1:1 related models with links. It uses Django's URL reversing and HTML formatting safely, with proper exception handling for missing URLs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears clean, maintainable, and focused solely on admin UI enhancement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard admin interface functions safely, with appropriate use of Django utilities. The overall security risk is low.",
