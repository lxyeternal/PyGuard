  "conclusion": "The critical security concern is the use of exec() on untrusted input, which justifies a high malware score of 0.9. Other reports, lacking code or suspicious patterns, are correctly scored with low malware and risk levels. The overall assessment confirms that the dependency does not exhibit malicious behavior except for the identified exec() pattern, which poses a severe security risk."
