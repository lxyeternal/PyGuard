  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security risks of the open source dependency based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from sys.argv, input(), environment variables, external modules, and potential command execution points.",
  "sinks": "exec() calls, network connections, file writes, data exfiltration points, or command executions with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input sources (sys.argv, input(), environment variables) to sinks like exec(), network transmission, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on untrusted input, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The reports indicate that only Report 4 explicitly identifies a dangerous pattern: use of exec() on untrusted input, which is a critical security flaw. The other reports lack code but reasonably assign low or zero scores based on absence of suspicious patterns. The high malware score (0.9) in Report 4 is justified due to the severity of executing external input without validation. Other reports' scores are consistent with their descriptions and the limited information. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is found outside Report 4. The overall security risk is primarily driven by the exec() pattern, warranting a high malware and risk score. The reasoning and scores across reports are coherent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The critical security concern is the use of exec() on untrusted input, which justifies a high malware score of 0.9. Other reports, lacking code or suspicious patterns, are correctly scored with low malware and risk levels. The overall assessment confirms that the dependency does not exhibit malicious behavior except for the identified exec() pattern, which poses a severe security risk.",
