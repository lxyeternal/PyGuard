  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task which involves data processing or interaction with external systems, but without the actual code, the precise purpose cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Data sources may include user input via function parameters, environment variables, or external data files/read operations; specific sources cannot be identified without code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system command executions; specifics cannot be identified without code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through variable assignments and function calls; exact paths cannot be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to the absence of code. Typical anomalies include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual function usage, none of which are visible here.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis without code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior can be assessed without the actual code content. The structure, data handling, and control flow are unknown.",
  "conclusion": "No specific malicious behavior or security risks can be identified based solely on the provided empty input. The code appears absent, making it impossible to evaluate for malware or security issues.",
