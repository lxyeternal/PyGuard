  "purpose": "Expose models and model mixins for extension or foreign key relationships, guiding callers to use API functions for creation/modification to maintain consistency.",
  "sources": "Wildcard imports from various models modules, relying on modules declaring __all__.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "Import statements (source) to namespace exposure (sink), with no data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports justified by __all__; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static import of models with a comment indicating __all__ declarations to mitigate risks. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The wildcard imports are justified and common in Django-like model exposure patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), acknowledging potential namespace pollution but justified by __all__ declarations. Confidence is high (around 0.9), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a controlled interface for models. The use of wildcard imports, when properly managed with __all__, does not pose significant security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
