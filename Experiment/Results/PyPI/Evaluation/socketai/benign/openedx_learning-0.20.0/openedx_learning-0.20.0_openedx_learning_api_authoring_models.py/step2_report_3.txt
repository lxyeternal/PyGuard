  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear; exposes models via imports.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of wildcard imports justified by `__all__`.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; only static imports.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 aligns with no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score (0.2):** Slightly above zero, justified by the potential risk of wildcard imports hiding malicious code if modules are compromised.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The wildcard import risk is acknowledged, but given the comment about `__all__`, the risk remains low. Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Anomalies:** Same concern about wildcard imports, justified by `__all__`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is perfect (1). Malware is 0, security risk low (0.1). \n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard imports justified; no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard model exposure.\n- **Scores:** Slightly lower confidence (0.8), but still high. Malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard imports justified; no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** High confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Justified. The slightly higher risk score reflects the general concern with wildcard imports, but overall, the assessment remains sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Anomalies:** Justified wildcard imports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's static import pattern and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero, justified by the inherent risks of wildcard imports, even if modules declare `__all__`.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the consistent reasoning and lack of any signs of malicious activity, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2, aligning with the reports, since wildcard imports can obscure imported symbols but are justified here.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and reasonable.\n- The scores are appropriate given the context.\n- The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, but with proper `__all__` declarations, this risk is minimized.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code appears benign, with no signs of supply chain or malicious compromise. The current scores reflect a cautious but justified stance.",
