  "purpose": "Provide helper functions and custom field classes for consistent and database-specific data modeling in Django applications.",
  "sources": "create_hash_digest function, various field factory functions, and custom field classes.",
  "sinks": "create_hash_digest function, models.UUIDField, models.CharField, models.DateTimeField.",
  "flows": "create_hash_digest processes input data bytes, returning a hash digest; hash_field stores this digest; UUID fields generate and store UUIDs; date-time fields accept externally provided UTC datetimes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Functions and classes appear to serve legitimate data modeling purposes. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various helper functions for creating database fields with specific behaviors, including hashing, case sensitivity, UUIDs, and date-times. The create_hash_digest function uses BLAKE2b for hashing, which is cryptographically sound for content identification, not for security purposes. The field functions generate Django model fields with particular database collation behaviors, useful for ensuring consistent sorting and uniqueness. All functions and classes are standard for Django ORM customization, with no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. No network calls, hidden code, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate collection of utility functions and custom fields aimed at consistent data modeling, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
