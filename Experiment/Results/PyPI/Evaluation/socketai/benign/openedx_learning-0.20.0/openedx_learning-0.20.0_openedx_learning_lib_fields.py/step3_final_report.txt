  "purpose": "Utility functions and custom Django model fields for handling IDs, hashes, collations, and UUIDs, aimed at ensuring data consistency and cross-database compatibility.",
  "sources": "Functions generate hashes from data bytes, create UUIDs, and define model fields that read data from function parameters or database inputs.",
  "sinks": "Hash digests stored in database fields, UUIDs generated and assigned to model fields, collation settings applied during database schema creation.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes or parameters) flow into hash functions or UUID generators, then into database fields; collation settings influence data storage and retrieval behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic hashing (BLAKE2b) for content deduplication, secure UUID generation via uuid.uuid4(), and carefully configured collation settings for cross-DB compatibility. All functions serve legitimate purposes in data modeling and integrity. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is well-structured, readable, and adheres to best practices, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, security-conscious utility code for Django models, with no malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
