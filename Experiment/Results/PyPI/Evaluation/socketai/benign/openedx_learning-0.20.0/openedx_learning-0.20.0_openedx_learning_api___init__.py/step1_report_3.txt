{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module or script, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to logs, files, or network connections; uses print statements or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; no complex or hidden data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. No obfuscated code present. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code follows conventional structure with clear function definitions and usage. No signs of malicious code such as network connections to suspicious domains, system modification, or data exfiltration routines. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious system calls. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected in the code flow. The overall implementation seems benign and typical of a utility or data processing script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to be safe, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
