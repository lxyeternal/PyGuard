  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input/output functions, data processing routines, environment variables, network operations, or data flows within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or system calls that could be exploited if untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "Data from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network connections or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code segments.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe code that is either absent, empty, or benign in nature, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Confidence scores are high (0.9 or 1), reflecting the clarity of benign code. Malware scores are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk scores are uniformly at 0.2, which is slightly conservative; lowering to 0.1 would be justified given the benign descriptions. No anomalies or suspicious flows are identified, and the code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code snippets and descriptions indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate, though a slight reduction in risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 could better reflect the benign nature. Overall, the reports are consistent, justified, and require no major revisions.",
