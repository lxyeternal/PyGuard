{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module for Open edX Learning, likely serving as a core component of the Learning platform.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the assignment of a version string (__version__ = \"0.20.0\"). No external input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that handle untrusted data, output, or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "No data flows from any sources to sinks since the code contains only a version string declaration with no dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a module docstring and a version variable. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple docstring comment and a single variable assignment indicating the version of the module. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic operations. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's versioning info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard version declaration for a module.",
