{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module or package initialization for 'Open edX Learning', likely setting a version identifier.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only a version string; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single string assignment setting __version__ to '0.20.0' and a comment indicating it relates to 'Open edX Learning'. There are no data input sources, sinks, or complex control flows. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The simplicity suggests this is a standard module header or metadata snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module version declaration with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
