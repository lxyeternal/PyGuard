{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal version declaration for the Open edX Learning Core module, providing version metadata without any operational logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains only a static docstring and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static metadata with no dynamic or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; it is a standard version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring and a version string assignment, with no dynamic behavior, external data interactions, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
