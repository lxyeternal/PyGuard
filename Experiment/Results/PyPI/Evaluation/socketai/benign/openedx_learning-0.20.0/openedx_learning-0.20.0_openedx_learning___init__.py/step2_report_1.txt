  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a simple Python snippet:\n     ```python\n     \"\"\"\n     Open edX Learning (\"Learning Core\").\n     \"\"\"\n\n     __version__ = \"0.20.0\"\n     ```\n   - It contains only a module docstring and a version string assignment.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no external data reads, and no dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network calls, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is standard for a version declaration in a Python package/module.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Flaws**:\n   - Given the simplicity, there are no evident security flaws or vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports correctly identify this as benign and typical.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n   - These are appropriate based on the code content.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the clarity and simplicity.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Overestimations**:\n   - Since the code is trivial, there's no basis for higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n   - The reports do not overstate any risks or suspicious behaviors.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Recommendations**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed; the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n  (No malicious behavior detected or implied.)\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n  (Code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.)\n\n- **Risk Score**: **0**  \n  (No security risks identified in this trivial version declaration.)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard, benign version declaration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
