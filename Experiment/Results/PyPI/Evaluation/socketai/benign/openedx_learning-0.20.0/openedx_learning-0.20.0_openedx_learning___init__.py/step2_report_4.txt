  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a simple Python snippet:\n     ```python\n     \"\"\"\n     Open edX Learning (\"Learning Core\").\n     \"\"\"\n\n     __version__ = \"0.20.0\"\n     ```\n   - It contains only a module-level docstring and a version string assignment.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or dynamic code.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The code appears to be a standard version declaration or module metadata.\n\n3. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are identified.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is consistent and accurate.\n\n4. **Score Analysis**:\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of any security concern.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The version string is harmless.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly challenge any claims of vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n   - The code is straightforward and does not warrant suspicion.\n\n7. **Score Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores assigned (all zeros) are reasonable and justified.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n8. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard version declaration.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Estimations**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis is a benign, minimal code snippet serving as a version indicator for the Open edX Learning Core module. No security risks or malicious behavior are detected or justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is necessary.",
