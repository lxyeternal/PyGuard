{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for 'design_groups' table in the 'ctgov' schema.",
  "sources": "Imports from SQLAlchemy, attributes of the DesignGroupModel class, and the __repr__ method.",
  "sinks": "Potential data handling in the __repr__ method; database interactions via ORM are standard and safe.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input sources are explicitly used in the code; __repr__ could be invoked with untrusted data but does not process raw input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. The __repr__ method may expose data if called with untrusted data, but this is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SQLAlchemy model with standard columns, foreign key constraints, and a __repr__ method. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The imports and ORM mappings are typical for database schema definitions. The __repr__ method may expose object data but does not execute code or leak data beyond string representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for typical database interaction within an application.",
