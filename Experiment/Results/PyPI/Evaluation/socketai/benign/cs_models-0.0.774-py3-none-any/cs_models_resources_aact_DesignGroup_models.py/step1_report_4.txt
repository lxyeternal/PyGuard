{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for the 'design_groups' table within the 'ctgov' schema.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string identifiers for table name, schema, and column names. It also reads class attributes for ORM mapping.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted input or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data. The code primarily sets up a database model with static schema and table definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The use of string formatting in __repr__ is standard and safe here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SQLAlchemy components to define a database model class 'DesignGroupModel'. It specifies table name, schema, and columns with data types and constraints. The __repr__ method provides a string representation of instances. No user input processing, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward ORM model definition for database interaction, with no malicious intent or security risks observed. It appears to be part of a larger application for managing study design data.",
