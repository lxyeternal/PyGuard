{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for the 'design_groups' table in the 'ctgov' schema.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the database via ORM queries on the 'design_groups' table, with input potentially coming from database records.",
  "sinks": "Data is only used within the application; no external sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database records into ORM object instances; no untrusted input handling is explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The __repr__ method formats object data but does not execute code or perform unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a SQLAlchemy ORM model with standard column definitions and relationships. It imports necessary modules, sets up the table with schema and columns, and implements a __repr__ method for debugging. No user input handling or external data sources are shown, and no malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The use of ORM and standard imports does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward schema definition with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition for a database table with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is unlikely to be malicious or dangerous.",
