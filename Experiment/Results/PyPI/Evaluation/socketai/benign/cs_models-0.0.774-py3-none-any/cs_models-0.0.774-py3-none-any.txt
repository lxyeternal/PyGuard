      "conclusion": "The code is not definitively malicious but contains features that warrant cautious review. The current malware score of 0.2, obfuscation score of 0.4, and risk score of 0.3 are appropriate given the evidence. If dynamic execution with untrusted input is confirmed, increase malware risk accordingly. No immediate threats are identified, but obfuscation and dynamic code features suggest ongoing vigilance."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to eval on untrusted data, network activity, and obfuscation. These indicators justify a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1, indicating high probability of malicious intent and danger. It should be treated as malicious and avoided or further analyzed in a secure environment."
