{
  "purpose": "To provide a context manager for managing sessions with a graph database, ensuring proper opening and closing of database sessions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'driver' object imported from '..graph_database' to initiate database sessions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; the code primarily manages database session lifecycle.",
  "flows": "The source 'driver.session()' creates a session which is yielded for use; finally, the session is closed after use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code follows standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that manages database sessions safely, ensuring resources are released properly. It imports a driver object, initiates a session, yields control for database operations, and guarantees session closure even if exceptions occur. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unsafe practices. The implementation appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard session management pattern for a graph database with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is a typical utility function for resource management with appropriate exception handling.",
