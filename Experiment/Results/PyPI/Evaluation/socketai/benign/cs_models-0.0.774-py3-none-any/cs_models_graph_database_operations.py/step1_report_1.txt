{
  "purpose": "Provides a context manager for managing database sessions in a transactional scope.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'driver' object from the relative '..graph_database' module to establish sessions.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'session.close()' which is a safe operation; no data leaks or untrusted data flows evident.",
  "flows": "The code creates a session via 'driver.session()', yields it for operations, then closes it after use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that initiates a database session from an imported driver object. It correctly manages resource cleanup with a try-finally block, ensuring sessions are closed even if exceptions occur. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The module's structure appears standard for database transaction management.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard resource management pattern for database sessions with no malicious activity or security issues detected.",
