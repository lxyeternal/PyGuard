{
  "purpose": "Provides a transactional scope for database session management using a context manager.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the external driver object via driver.session().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Source (driver.session()) -> yield session -> session.close() in finally block.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a context manager that manages database sessions, ensuring proper cleanup. It imports driver from a relative module, uses try-finally for resource management, and re-raises exceptions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern support a benign assessment. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero. Confidence is high (1.0), and obfuscation is absent (0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured resource management pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
