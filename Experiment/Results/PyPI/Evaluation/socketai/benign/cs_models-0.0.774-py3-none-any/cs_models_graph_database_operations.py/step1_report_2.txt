{
  "purpose": "Provide a context-managed transactional scope for database operations using a session from the graph database driver.",
  "sources": "driver.session() call to create a new database session.",
  "sinks": "session.close() to terminate the session; no other sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Code flow starts with session creation, then yields the session for use, and finally ensures session closure after operation, regardless of success or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward and standard for managing database sessions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context manager that opens a session from a graph database driver, yields it for use, and ensures closure of the session after operations complete. It correctly handles exceptions by re-raising them, preventing suppression of errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code relies on the external driver, which is typical in database interaction modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a standard implementation for managing database sessions safely. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured utility function.",
