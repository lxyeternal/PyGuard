  "purpose": "Provide a context-managed transactional session for database operations using the graph_database driver.",
  "sources": "Import of contextlib for context management, import of driver from parent module, creation of a session via driver.session()",
  "sinks": "The session object returned by driver.session() used within the context, session.close() called in finally block",
  "flows": "The context manager yields a session object which is used for database operations, then closes the session after use",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no unusual dynamic execution, no obfuscated code or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple context manager that initializes a database session from an imported driver, yields it for operations, and ensures closure of the session. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code constructs. It correctly manages resources with proper exception handling. The use of relative import indicates modular code but nothing suspicious is present. The overall pattern aligns with standard resource management in database interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured context manager for database sessions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
