  "purpose": "Provides a transactional context manager for database operations using a graph database driver.",
  "sources": "driver.session() to initiate a database session.",
  "sinks": "session.close() called in the finally block.",
  "flows": "Code flow starts with session creation, yields control for operations, then ensures session closure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs. The code is a standard pattern for managing database sessions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports contextlib for managing context, defines a session_scope context manager that initiates a database session, and ensures proper cleanup with session.close(). No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The only external dependency is the driver, which is expected for database interactions. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or other security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, safe implementation of a database session management pattern. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
