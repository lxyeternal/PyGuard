  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe a simple assignment of the string `'example_pkg'` to the variable `name`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No report indicates any obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign and performs a basic variable assignment.\n   - The code does not read external inputs, write to files, or perform network operations.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or flaws are evident; the code is syntactically correct and functionally trivial.\n   - The reasoning in each report correctly concludes benign behavior.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Consistency:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n     - `confidence` = 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made about malicious intent; the analysis is accurate.\n   - The code is so minimal that even considering obfuscation or malware is unnecessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, benign variable assignment.\n   - There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0** — no security risk.\n\n**Additional note:** The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a simple assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores are justified and should not be changed.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
