  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Actual Issues:**\n   - All reports describe a simple assignment of the string `'example_pkg'` to the variable `name`.\n   - The original code is straightforward: `name = \"example_pkg\"`.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, external data access, or other suspicious constructs.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple, static assignment with no external interactions.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Malware and Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is just a static assignment with no malicious intent, malware score should remain 0.\n   - Security risk is also 0, as there's no vulnerability or suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Metric            | Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0      | No malicious behavior or code present.                                        |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.                            |\n| Security Risk     | 0      | No vulnerabilities or security issues identified.                            |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.**",
