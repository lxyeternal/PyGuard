{
  "purpose": "This code assigns a static string 'example_pkg' to the variable 'name', serving as a simple identifier or label within a larger program.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a direct assignment of a constant string value.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only a static assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the flow is limited to the assignment statement itself.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple variable assignment with no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence (score 1). There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity confirms its benign intent, and the analysis aligns across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static assignment with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
