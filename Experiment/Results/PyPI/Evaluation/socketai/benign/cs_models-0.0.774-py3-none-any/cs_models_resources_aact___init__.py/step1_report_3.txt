  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, but without specific context, its exact purpose cannot be determined. It likely performs data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or possibly external files if present in the full code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or system calls that could lead to data leakage or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network calls or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or hardcoded credentials are identified. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution are detected in the visible parts.",
  "analysis": "The code has been examined at the beginning, middle, and end. No malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No suspicious loops, hidden functions, or data leaks are identified. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal utility script without evidence of malicious intent.",
