  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, files, input parameters, and data flows within the code.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, output functions.",
  "flows": "From data sources such as environment variables or files to output or network sinks, with no suspicious or anomalous paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, performing standard data processing tasks without suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code's behavior aligns with benign usage, and the lack of obfuscation or suspicious data flows supports a low threat assessment. Confidence is high due to the straightforward nature of the code, and no anomalies are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns justify low security risk scores. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
