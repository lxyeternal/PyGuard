  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, files, network sockets, and user input; uses eval on untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, eval execution, potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, files, user input) flow into eval, network sockets, and file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval on untrusted data, hardcoded IPs, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, network activity to unknown domains.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as eval on untrusted input, obfuscation, network connections to suspicious IPs, and use of environment variables for sensitive data. These behaviors suggest potential malicious intent, including remote command execution or data exfiltration. The presence of obfuscation and dynamic code execution increases suspicion. No benign patterns or safe practices are evident. The code's structure and signals align with high malicious potential.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high suspicion of malicious behavior, primarily due to eval on untrusted data, network activity, and obfuscation. These indicators justify a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1, indicating high probability of malicious intent and danger. It should be treated as malicious and avoided or further analyzed in a secure environment.",
