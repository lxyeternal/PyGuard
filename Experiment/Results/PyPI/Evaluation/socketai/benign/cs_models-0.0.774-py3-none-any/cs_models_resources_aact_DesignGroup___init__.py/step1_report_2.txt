  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific function, which needs to be determined by analyzing its operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from variables, function parameters, environment variables, or external sources such as files or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network transmissions, database queries, file writes, or other operations that could expose data or alter system state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through various processing steps and may reach sinks, especially if untrusted input is used without validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns include hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, obfuscated or minified code, excessive use of eval or exec, or hidden network communication calls.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for sources, sinks, and data flows. No signs of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communication to suspicious domains were observed. The code contains standard library usage and no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code structure appears typical, with no unusual dynamic execution or hidden behaviors. Some areas were checked for hardcoded secrets or unsafe practices; none were found. Overall, the code appears benign, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve its intended purpose without suspicious or harmful operations. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
