  "conclusion": "The code is not definitively malicious but contains features that warrant cautious review. The current malware score of 0.2, obfuscation score of 0.4, and risk score of 0.3 are appropriate given the evidence. If dynamic execution with untrusted input is confirmed, increase malware risk accordingly. No immediate threats are identified, but obfuscation and dynamic code features suggest ongoing vigilance."
