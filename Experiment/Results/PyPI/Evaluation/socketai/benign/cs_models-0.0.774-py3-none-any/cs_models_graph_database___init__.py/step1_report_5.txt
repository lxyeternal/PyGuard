  "purpose": "Establish a connection to a Neo4j graph database with dynamic host resolution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for URI, username, and password; the resolver function that yields hostnames and ports based on input address.",
  "sinks": "GraphDatabase.driver method which creates a database driver using the provided URI, credentials, and resolver.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → create_driver function → resolver function → GraphDatabase.driver",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for credentials is standard; resolver modifies hostnames based on input, which could be used maliciously if manipulated. No hardcoded secrets aside from default credentials. The resolver's conditional yield pattern could redirect or manipulate host resolution, but no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data (URI, user, password) from environment variables, which is common practice. The resolver function alters hostname resolution if the address matches a specific pattern, potentially affecting connection routing. This could be used maliciously to redirect database connections if exploited, but as written, it appears as a normal custom resolver. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or unauthorized data access observed. The default credentials are weak but not malicious by themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main function is to set up a database driver with a custom hostname resolver. There is no direct malicious behavior or malware evident. The resolver could potentially be used maliciously if manipulated externally, but within this context, it appears as a legitimate configuration feature. Overall, the code seems benign.",
