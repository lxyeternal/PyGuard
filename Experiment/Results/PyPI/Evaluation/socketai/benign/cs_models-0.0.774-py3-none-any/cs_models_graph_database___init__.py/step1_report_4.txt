  "purpose": "Establish a connection to a Neo4j database using environment variables for configuration, with a custom resolver for address resolution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables GRAPH_DB_URI, GRAPH_DB_USER, GRAPH_DB_PASSWORD; function resolver for host resolution.",
  "sinks": "GraphDatabase.driver function that creates the database driver with provided credentials.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide connection info (source). The create_driver function uses these to create a driver (sink). The resolver function potentially alters host resolution, which could influence connection routing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for credentials is typical, but hardcoded default passwords (e.g., 'mindgram12') can be a security concern. The resolver function changes host resolution behavior for specific hostnames, which might be intended or suspicious if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code reads database connection details from environment variables, with default values that include a hardcoded password, which can be considered insecure. The create_driver function defines a resolver function that modifies host resolution for specific hostnames, potentially altering network routing or load balancing. This customization might be benign but warrants scrutiny. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code does not perform any suspicious network activity or system modifications beyond establishing a database connection. The presence of hardcoded credentials, especially with a default password, is a security concern but not malicious per se. The resolver function's purpose is unclear and could be misused if modified maliciously; however, as presented, it appears to be an intended feature.",
  "conclusion": "The code establishes a database connection with environment-configured parameters, including a custom hostname resolver. No malicious actions are evident; however, hardcoded default credentials and the custom resolver could pose security risks if misused. Overall, the code does not show malicious behavior but has some security weaknesses related to credential management and hostname resolution customization.",
