  "purpose": "Establish a connection to a Neo4j graph database using environment variables for configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: GRAPH_DB_URI, GRAPH_DB_USER, GRAPH_DB_PASSWORD",
  "sinks": "GraphDatabase.driver() function which creates a database driver and potentially sensitive credentials used therein",
  "flows": "Environment variables → create_driver() → GraphDatabase.driver() with credentials",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for credentials is common; the resolver function conditionally yields different hostnames based on the address, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets aside from defaults, which are not necessarily suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code reads database connection parameters from environment variables, which is standard practice for configuration. It defines a resolver function that modifies hostnames based on the input address, which could be used for load balancing or environment-specific routing but does not appear malicious. The resolver's logic is straightforward and does not execute any untrusted or malicious code. The code then creates a database driver with these parameters. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity within this snippet. No suspicious obfuscation, data leaks, or malware-like behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical database connection setup with dynamic hostname resolution. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of environment variables for credentials is standard practice, and the resolver logic appears to be for hostname management rather than malicious activity.",
