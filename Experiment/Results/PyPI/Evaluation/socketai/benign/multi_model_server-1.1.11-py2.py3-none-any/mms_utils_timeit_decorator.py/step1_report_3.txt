{
  "purpose": "A decorator function to measure and log the execution time and CPU time of a given function.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'time' module and uses 'time.time()' and 'time.clock()' to gather timing data within the decorator.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs timing information; no untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Decorator wraps a function, captures start times, executes the function, then logs timing data; flow is straightforward timing measurement.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'time.clock()', which is deprecated in Python 3.3+ and may produce inconsistent results across platforms, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a timing decorator that records execution and CPU time of a function and prints the results. No external data input or output beyond printing is involved. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident. The use of 'time.clock()' is outdated but not malicious. The code is simple, purpose-specific, and free of suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard timing decorator used for performance profiling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
