{
  "purpose": "A decorator to measure and log the execution and CPU time of functions for profiling purposes.",
  "sources": "The function being decorated; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs timing information; no data leaks or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Input to the decorated function flows through the decorator, which measures start and end times, then outputs via print.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'time.clock()', which is deprecated in Python 3.3+, but this is a maintainability issue, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward timing decorator that uses standard timing functions to measure execution time. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The primary concern is the use of the deprecated 'time.clock()', which could be replaced with 'time.perf_counter()' for better accuracy and future compatibility. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The print statement is benign, serving only for logging. The code's purpose is benign, and there are no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign profiling utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only technical flaw is the outdated use of 'time.clock()', which does not impact security but should be updated for best practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
