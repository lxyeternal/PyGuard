  "purpose": "A decorator to measure and log the execution time and CPU time of a function.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'time' and 'functools' modules, specifically 'time.time', 'time.clock', and 'wraps'.",
  "sinks": "Print statement used to output timing information.",
  "flows": "Function execution flow: start time and CPU time are recorded, the decorated function runs, then end time and CPU time are recorded, followed by logging via print.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behaviors, no external data fetching, and no dynamic code execution. Use of 'time.clock()' (deprecated in Python 3.3+) is not suspicious but indicates outdated code, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple timing decorator, which wraps any function to log its execution duration and CPU time. The timing metrics are obtained using standard library functions, and the output is sent to standard output via print(). There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward and safe. The use of 'time.clock()' suggests that this code is somewhat outdated, but this does not constitute a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless timing decorator used for performance monitoring. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be standard, non-malicious code for measuring function execution time.",
