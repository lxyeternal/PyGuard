{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator to measure and log the execution time and CPU time of functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the function's name (func.__name__) and uses the time module to record start and end times.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to standard output using print(), which is generally benign; no untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The function execution flow involves recording start times, executing the wrapped function, recording end times, and printing the timing information.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code uses standard timing functions without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple timing decorator that logs function execution time. It uses time.time() and time.clock() for timing. No external inputs are processed in a harmful manner, and no data leaks or malicious actions are present. The print statement outputs timing info to standard output; this is common and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward timing decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for performance measurement.",
