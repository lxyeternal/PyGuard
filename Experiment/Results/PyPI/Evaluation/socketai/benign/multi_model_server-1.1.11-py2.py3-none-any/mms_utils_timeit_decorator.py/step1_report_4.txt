  "purpose": "A decorator to measure and log the execution time of a function.",
  "sources": "The decorator function 'timeit', which wraps around the target function and records start times.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the execution times to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input to 'func' -> 'start' and 'start_cpu' timestamps -> execution of 'func' -> 'end' and 'end_cpu' timestamps -> print logging the duration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The code uses standard timing functions and straightforward logging without any suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'timeit' decorator that measures real and CPU execution time of a function. It uses 'time.time()' and 'time.clock()' to capture start and end times, then logs the durations via print. No external data sources, untrusted input handling, or malicious code is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code performs a typical profiling task with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for measuring function execution time. It does not contain malware or security risks, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
