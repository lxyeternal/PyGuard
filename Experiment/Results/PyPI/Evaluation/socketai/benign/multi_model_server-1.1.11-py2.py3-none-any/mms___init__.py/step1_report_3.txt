  "purpose": "Document the setup and initialization of a model server with endpoints and versioning.",
  "sources": "The code imports a local version module and reads the __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs imports and defines module-level variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The comments and structure are standard for an open-source model server module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily includes licensing comments, a docstring explaining the module's purpose, and a straightforward import of a local version module. It assigns __version__ to version.__version__, indicating version tracking. No input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present. No dynamic execution, external calls, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initialization script for a model server. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
