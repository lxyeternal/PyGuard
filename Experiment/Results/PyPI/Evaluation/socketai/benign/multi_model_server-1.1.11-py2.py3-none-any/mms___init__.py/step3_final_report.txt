  "purpose": "Initialize the model server, create endpoints, and expose basic health and description endpoints.",
  "sources": "Import of local 'version' module, assignment of '__version__' from 'version.__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external calls, no network communication, no user input processing.",
  "flows": "Import of 'version' module -> assignment to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward module with licensing comments, a descriptive docstring, and a simple import and assignment. It does not handle any external data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The import of a local 'version' module is standard practice and does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns suggest it is benign. The reports labeled as 'Empty response' do not provide additional concerns. Overall, the code poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard initialization module for a model server with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are consistent with this assessment. No further action or concern is necessary.",
