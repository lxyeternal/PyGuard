  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a model server worker with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary risks are operational, related to environment and filesystem handling, but these do not indicate malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary."
