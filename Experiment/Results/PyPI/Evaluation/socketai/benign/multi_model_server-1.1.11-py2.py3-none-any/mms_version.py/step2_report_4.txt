  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Content Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single variable assignment:\n  ```python\n  __version__ = '1.1.11'\n  ```\n- No executable logic, input/output operations, data processing, or external data sources.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code contains only licensing comments and a version string. There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in this snippet.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports consistently state that the code is benign, standard, and contains only metadata. Their reasoning is sound and based on the code's actual content.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's nature.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of executable or sensitive code.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since there is no executable code, no data handling, and no suspicious activity, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- Malware score is also correctly at **0** because there's no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated code score is **0** as there's no obfuscation.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- The analysis confirms that this is a benign, standard header file with licensing and version info only.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a typical open-source license header with a version string, posing no security threat or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are correct; no changes needed. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and non-malicious.",
