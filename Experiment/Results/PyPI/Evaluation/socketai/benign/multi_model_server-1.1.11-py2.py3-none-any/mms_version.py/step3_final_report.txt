  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version identifier for the software module, providing licensing information and version tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a variable assignment (__version__ = '1.1.11').",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely informational.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code does not process or handle any input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and a version string assignment; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static snippet with licensing comments and a version variable. It does not perform any operations, handle data, or include executable logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely informational, and it poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license header with a version string, containing no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
