  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata for a Python package, specifically defining a version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string '__version__' assigned as '1.1.11'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns and documents a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing information and a simple version assignment. No user input, environment variables, or external data is read. The version string is hardcoded. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward license header and version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be standard package metadata.",
