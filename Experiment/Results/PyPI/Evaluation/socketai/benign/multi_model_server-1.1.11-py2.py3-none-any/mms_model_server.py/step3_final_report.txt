  "purpose": "Process management for starting and stopping a Java-based model server, handling environment variables, configuration files, and process lifecycle.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (JAVA_HOME, TEMP), configuration files (log_config, mms_config), PID files, command-line arguments, external files (config.properties, mms configs).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess invocation for Java server startup, process termination via psutil, file operations for PID management.",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables and config files -> constructing command-line arguments -> spawning subprocess -> managing process lifecycle via PID files and psutil.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Code is straightforward and standard for process control.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical process management tasks: reading environment variables, validating configuration files, constructing Java command with JVM options, managing PID files, and controlling process lifecycle with psutil. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The subprocess commands are built from controlled inputs, and error handling is appropriate. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk 0.1-0.2) are justified based on the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured process management utility for a Java-based model server. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise are evident. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
