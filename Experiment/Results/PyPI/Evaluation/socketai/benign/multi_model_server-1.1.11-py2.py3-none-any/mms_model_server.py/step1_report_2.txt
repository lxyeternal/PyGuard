{
  "purpose": "To serve as the entry point for starting and stopping the Model Server (MMS), including configuration and process management.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (JAVA_HOME, TEMP), command-line arguments (args), configuration files, PID files, and input parameters for process control.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocesses (subprocess.Popen), file deletion (os.remove), process termination (psutil), environment variable access, and file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments influence subprocess command creation, environment variables influence configuration, and process management commands control server lifecycle.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Use of process management and file handling appears standard. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages server lifecycle by starting/stopping processes based on provided arguments and environment settings. It reads configuration files and environment variables, constructs Java command-line calls, and manages process IDs via PID files. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are evident. The code handles process termination and creation securely and does not contain suspicious logic or obfuscated patterns. It relies on standard libraries and common process control techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical process control script for managing a server application. It performs expected actions such as starting/stopping processes, reading configs, and managing PID files. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks are present.",
