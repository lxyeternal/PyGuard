  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign ML inference wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments."
