{
  "purpose": "The code implements a custom inference service wrapper that handles request processing, model inference, and response generation, primarily for ML model prediction.",
  "sources": "Request data is read from request_batch objects, specifically from requestId, parameters, headers, and the input batch contents; the code decodes headers and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks indicate dangerous data flows; responses are generated via create_predict_response, and data is processed internally without external calls that could leak data.",
  "flows": "Input data (requestId, parameters, headers) flow through retrieve_data_for_inference into headers and input_batch; then predict() passes input_batch to the model's entry point; responses are constructed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard request processing logic; no suspicious or unusual code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are evident. Usage of decode('utf-8') on request data is standard; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles request data by decoding headers and parameters, processes data for model inference, and handles exceptions cleanly. There are no signs of malicious payloads or malicious control flows. The exception handling is generic and does not reveal sensitive info. The code adheres to typical ML service patterns. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a model inference wrapper without malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It correctly processes inputs and outputs without evident security issues.",
