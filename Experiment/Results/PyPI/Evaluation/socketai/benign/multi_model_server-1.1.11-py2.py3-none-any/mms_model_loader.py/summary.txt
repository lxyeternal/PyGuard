  "conclusion": "The code is a standard model loader utilizing dynamic imports, which introduces supply chain and remote code execution risks if inputs are untrusted. No malicious activity or payloads are detected, but the pattern of dynamic import without validation warrants caution. Proper input validation, whitelisting, or sandboxing would mitigate these risks."
