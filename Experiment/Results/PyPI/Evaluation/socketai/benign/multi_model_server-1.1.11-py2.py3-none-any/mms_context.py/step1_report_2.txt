  "purpose": "Define classes to handle request context and processing for a model server environment",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters for Context and RequestProcessor objects, request headers, request IDs, request properties, request headers, request status, response headers",
  "sinks": "Methods accessing request headers, response headers, request IDs, and setting response properties or status codes",
  "flows": "Request headers and properties flow into request processing methods, which set or retrieve response headers and status codes; request IDs are retrieved via get_request_id()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URL/domain references. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Code is primarily straightforward request/response handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for managing request and response context, including request headers, response headers, status codes, and properties. It uses object-oriented design with getters and setters for encapsulation. No external input is directly processed or executed. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The data flows are limited to request and response metadata handling. The code does not include network calls, system commands, or other actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of request/response context management for a server environment, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to organize request data and response metadata.",
