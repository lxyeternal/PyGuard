{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing request context and processing request headers and responses in a server environment, primarily for model serving or API handling.",
  "sources": "Request data from _request_header in RequestProcessor, system properties in Context constructor, request IDs, and request headers via methods such as get_request_id and get_request_header.",
  "sinks": "Methods that set response headers and status codes (set_response_header, set_response_status, set_all_response_status), potentially modifying or exposing request/response data.",
  "flows": "Request data is read from request headers (_request_header) and request processor (_request_processor). Response headers and status are set via context methods that invoke request_processor methods. Data flows from incoming request headers to response headers or status codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code primarily manages request and response metadata without any suspicious or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The classes provide a structured way to manage request and response data within a server context. The code reads input data from request headers and manages response headers and status codes in an organized manner. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or malicious activities are detected. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger application for request handling, with no signs of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a utility for request/response management in a server environment. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and is consistent with normal application code. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
