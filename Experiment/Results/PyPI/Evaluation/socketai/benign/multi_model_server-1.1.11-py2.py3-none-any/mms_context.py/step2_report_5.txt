  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as request/response management classes, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is straightforward, primarily handling headers, status codes, and request IDs.\n- No external network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are identified.\n- The reported \"sources\" and \"sinks\" are typical for such utility classes.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited for malicious purposes.\n- The scores for malware are consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (around 0.1–0.2), consistent with the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports' assessments seem accurate and well-justified.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The logic and data flows are standard for request/response handling.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1–0.2) are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, typical for utility code in a server environment)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reports are consistent with this assessment.",
