  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the script as a straightforward deprecation warning message.\n- The code is minimal, containing only a print statement with ANSI escape sequences for colored output.\n- No external data, network activity, or complex logic is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious intent are identified.\n- The purpose is purely informational, guiding users to a new tool.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n\n1. **Presence of Issues:**  \n   - The code matches the description in all reports; no discrepancies or missing elements are observed.\n   - The code is benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code as a simple deprecation message.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - These scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, data processing, or system modifications.\n   - The risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   - The code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   - All claims are cautious and based on code analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign, straightforward deprecation notice.\n- No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, since it's just informational but still worth noting that it's a deprecation message)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or behavior. It serves a purely informational purpose, and all evidence supports a zero malware and obfuscation score. The slight non-zero risk score (0.1) reflects the fact that, in a security context, any code that executes could potentially be exploited if modified, but in its current form, it poses no risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The scores are appropriate; no changes needed.",
