  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains only static print statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code performs only a print operation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script executes a static print statement directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static CLI message with a license header, printing a deprecation warning with ANSI color codes. It involves no external data, network activity, or complex logic. The ANSI escape sequences are standard for CLI coloring and do not indicate malicious intent. The script's purpose is purely informational, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and static nature support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward deprecation notice with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the absence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
