  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code to ensure consistency, accuracy, and to determine appropriate scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All scripts are minimal CLI notices about deprecation.\n- No external data, user input, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or malicious constructs.\n- The code is straightforward, with static print statements and no complex logic.\n- No evidence of malware, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Deprecation message with ANSI color codes.\n- **Analysis & Verdict:** Correctly identifies the script as benign. The ANSI escape sequences are standard for colored output, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0, Risk: 0.5 (since it's a deprecation notice, not a risk per se). The report assigns a risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Simple deprecation message, no external dependencies.\n- **Analysis & Verdict:** Correctly notes the benign nature. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns 0 for all, which is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Deprecation notice with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Verdict:** Correctly identified as benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Simple static message indicating deprecation.\n- **Analysis & Verdict:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report's scores align with the code's simplicity.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** CLI deprecation message, no external data or malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious. I agree with a malware score of **0** for all.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. Assigning **0** is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Since these scripts are purely informational, deprecation notices, and contain no vulnerabilities or malicious code, a risk score of **0** is appropriate.\n\n**However,** if I were to assign a **personal estimate** based on the entire set:\n\n| Metric             | Justification                                              | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | No malicious activity or payloads detected.                | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.           | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or system modifications. | 0               |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification**\n- The scripts are minimal, static CLI messages with no external dependencies or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is purely informational, serving as deprecation notices.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Therefore, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- **Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's actual behavior.",
