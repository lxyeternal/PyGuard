  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Content Verification:**\n   - The code is a simple script that prints a deprecation warning message.\n   - It contains no external data reads, network calls, or complex logic.\n   - The message uses ANSI escape sequences for colored output, which is standard for CLI warnings.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The licensing comments are standard and do not influence runtime behavior.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, serving solely as an informational message.\n   - There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - No external dependencies or inputs are involved.\n   - The message is static and hardcoded, with no dynamic or untrusted data.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity or payload)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk; the script is purely informational)\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions & Claims:**\n   - The reports assume the code is safe based on its simplicity, which is reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are justified given the code's nature.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, which aligns with the code content.\n   - The overall security risk is correctly identified as zero.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessment of this script as benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis script is a straightforward deprecation notice with no security concerns. No changes to the scoring are necessary.",
