{
  "purpose": "Display a message indicating that a deprecated CLI command is no longer supported and direct users to a new tool.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; only the script's own print statement is used.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, simple, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports no external modules, performs no input operations, and merely prints a static informational message. The comment block is licensing information, and the main() function outputs a notice that the command is deprecated, directing users to a new tool with a URL. No external data inputs, network activity, or malicious code execution paths are present. The code's structure is simple and consistent with standard practices for a deprecation notice.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as a deprecation warning. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
