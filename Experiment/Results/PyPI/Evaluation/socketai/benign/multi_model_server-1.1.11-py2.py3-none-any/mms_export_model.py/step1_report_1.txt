{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command line interface message indicating deprecation of a feature and directs users to an alternative tool.",
  "sources": "The only source of input is the script execution trigger (__name__ == '__main__'), which initiates the main() function.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the print statement that outputs a warning message to the console.",
  "flows": "Input (script execution) triggers main(), which outputs a message via print() to the console.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and contains only a deprecation notice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a main() function that prints a deprecation warning message about an unsupported feature. The message includes ANSI escape sequences for colored output. The script runs main() if executed directly. There are no external data reads, network calls, or complex logic. The code is purely informational and does not perform any data processing, system modifications, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign deprecation notice with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply informs users about an unsupported feature and provides a link for more information.",
