{
  "purpose": "The code defines argument parsers for a multi-model server and its worker, facilitating command-line configuration and operation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments via argparse.ArgumentParser",
  "sinks": "The parsed arguments are used internally to configure server behavior; no direct data leaks or unsafe operations are evident",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow into internal configurations for server and worker setup, without passing untrusted data to dangerous sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present; functions and classes appear standard and well-structured",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard argument parsing functionalities for server control and worker configuration using argparse. It includes methods for converting string inputs to booleans, defining required and optional arguments, and handling mutually exclusive groups. There are no indications of malicious intent such as hidden network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of CLI argument handling, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Its purpose is to facilitate server startup and worker configuration in a controlled manner, without executing any untrusted or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical argument parser setup for server configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely converts command-line inputs into configurations without handling or transmitting sensitive data maliciously.",
