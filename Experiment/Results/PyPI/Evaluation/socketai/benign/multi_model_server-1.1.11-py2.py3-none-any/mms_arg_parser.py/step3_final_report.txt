  "purpose": "Parse command-line arguments for multi-model-server operations, including starting, stopping, and configuring server parameters.",
  "sources": "Command-line inputs provided by the user, such as --start, --stop, --mms-config, --model-store, --models, --log-config, --foreground, and other arguments in model_service_worker_args().",
  "sinks": "Potentially downstream code that uses parsed arguments to control server behavior, load models, or configure network settings.",
  "flows": "Arguments are parsed via argparse, validated, and then used by the server to determine operational mode, configuration files, model locations, and network parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard argument parsing logic. Minor typographical error in help text ('contains' instead of 'contains') but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of argument parsing for a server application. It uses standard Python libraries without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond command-line arguments. The validation functions and argument definitions follow best practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The only potential concern is that downstream use of arguments could introduce vulnerabilities, but within this code, no such issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured argument parser for a multi-model server. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and overall, the code is safe for use.",
