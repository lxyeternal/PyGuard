{
  "purpose": "This module provides argument parsing for a multi-model server, handling command-line options for starting, stopping, and configuring the server and worker processes.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse for various server and worker configuration options, including config files, model paths, and network settings.",
  "sinks": "Uses the parsed arguments to configure server behaviors; no untrusted data execution or data leak mechanisms are directly present.",
  "flows": "Command-line input flows into argparse parsing functions, influencing server and worker configuration parameters, but no untrusted data is executed or transmitted within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. The code appears to be straightforward argument parsing logic with proper input handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static methods for argument parsing, including a custom boolean conversion, and specific functions to generate argument parsers for server and worker configurations. It properly uses argparse for handling command-line options, with no apparent insecure or malicious patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's structure is typical for CLI argument parsing, with no obfuscation or suspicious flow. It does not execute external commands or handle untrusted data beyond argument parsing.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard argument parsing for server configuration without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behavior, and the implementation appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
