  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code is a straightforward argument parser for a multi-model server, with no malicious features.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard, well-structured, with no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious or security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard argument parsing with validation, no unsafe data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still negligible)\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; only standard validation and argument handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with minimal security concern primarily due to the nature of accepting command-line args.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is typical argument parsing for server configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no external code execution, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard argument parser with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Typical CLI argument handling, safe practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Also confirms standard argument parsing with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (again, very low)\n- **Analysis:** No unsafe operations, no code injection, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports identify any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that the code is benign.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily because this code is just argument parsing and does not handle untrusted data beyond command-line inputs, which is typical and expected.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent across reports and justified)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and uses common Python practices.\n- No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The only minor concern could be misuse of arguments downstream, but within this code, no issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the detailed analysis above.",
