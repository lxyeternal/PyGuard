  "purpose": "Unit testing for the 'ansicon' module to verify load and unload functionality.",
  "sources": "import statements, ansicon.load(), ansicon.unload(), ansicon.loaded(), ansicon._ANSICON.dll",
  "sinks": "ansicon.load(), ansicon.unload(), ansicon._ANSICON.dll access, print statements",
  "flows": "ansicon.load() and ansicon.unload() control the DLL state; _ANSICON.dll access manipulates internal DLL handle; print statements display status",
  "anomalies": "Access to protected member '_ANSICON.dll' for test purposes, which indicates testing rather than malicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'ansicon' module, mainly invoking functions to load and unload DLLs and checking their states. It performs expected testing procedures, including handling error conditions. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or suspicious network activity. The use of protected member access for testing is standard practice. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate unit testing code for the 'ansicon' module, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely tests DLL loading/unloading processes and handles potential errors appropriately.",
