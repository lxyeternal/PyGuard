  "purpose": "Unit testing module for ansicon DLL loading and unloading functionality",
  "sources": "importing ansicon module, standard unittest functions, and print statements",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sources or sensitive data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code primarily tests ansicon's internal load/unload methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No obfuscation or suspicious operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing for the ansicon module's DLL load and unload functions. It loads, tests, and unloads DLLs, including handling errors. All actions are within normal testing scope; no external network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious code behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a benign test module focused on verifying DLL load/unload functionality of ansicon. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks detected.",
