{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite for the 'ansicon' module, specifically testing DLL load and unload operations, including error handling scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads internal variables such as 'ansicon.loaded()', 'ansicon._ANSICON.dll', and standard print statements for status messages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or data leaks are present; the code does not write to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input sources include internal function calls and variable states; flows involve DLL load/unload functions and internal attribute manipulations for testing error conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of internal protected attributes (_ANSICON.dll) for testing failure scenarios is unconventional but standard in testing contexts; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit testing module for DLL management within the 'ansicon' library. It performs load/unload operations, verifies states, and tests error handling by manipulating internal variables. No external data, network activity, or malicious payloads are involved. The internal attribute manipulation is typical for testing error conditions. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the testing approach is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite for DLL load/unload operations, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect its safe and non-malicious nature.",
