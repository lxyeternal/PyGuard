  "purpose": "A Python wrapper for loading and unloading the ANSICON DLL to enable ANSI escape sequences in Windows terminals.",
  "sources": "os.path functions to determine DLL path, sys.maxsize for architecture, ctypes.WinDLL to load DLL, kernel32.FreeLibrary to unload DLL.",
  "sinks": "Loading DLL via ctypes.WinDLL, unloading via kernel32.FreeLibrary.",
  "flows": "Determine DLL path -> load DLL -> use DLL functions -> unload DLL.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious API misuse detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward DLL loader for ANSICON, using standard Windows API calls with dynamic path determination based on system architecture. It manages DLL handles properly, with no network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The code is simple, clear, and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, reflecting minimal security concern. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign DLL loader for Windows, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified, indicating a very low security risk and no malware presence.",
