  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging and distributing the 'ansicon' Python wrapper, mainly for defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description, static package data, and metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data processing occur in this code.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content for package description; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors; uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional Python setup configuration. It imports standard modules, reads a static README file for long description, and defines package metadata including name, version, author, URL, license, dependencies, package data, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, no user input processing, and no network operations are present. The code aligns with standard packaging practices and does not contain malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script used for packaging a Python project. It does not include any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
