  "purpose": "A Python setup script for packaging the 'ansicon' module, defining metadata and reading a local README file.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file from local filesystem",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> uses setuptools to configure package metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python packaging script that imports 'io' and 'setuptools', defines a helper function to read a local README file, and calls 'setup()' with package details. It does not perform dynamic code execution, network calls, or process untrusted input. All signals point to benign, well-structured code. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
