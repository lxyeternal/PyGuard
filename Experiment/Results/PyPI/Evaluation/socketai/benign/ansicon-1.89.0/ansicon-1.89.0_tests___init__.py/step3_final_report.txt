  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source dependency based on provided code reviews.",
  "sources": "Not explicitly provided; analysis based on code snippets or lack thereof, including any input points or data reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, malicious network connections, or code execution points if malicious code exists.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks, such as untrusted data flowing into system calls, network operations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, missing implementation, or suspicious patterns like obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code presence, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Confidence levels are appropriately adjusted based on available information, with low scores for malware (0) and obfuscation (0). Risk scores are low (0.2 or 0), reflecting minimal threat. The reasoning across reports is consistent, and the scores align with the evidence or lack thereof. No significant anomalies or suspicious signals are identified. Given the absence of concrete code or malicious indicators, the overall assessment remains that the dependency is benign with very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation based on current reviews. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary; the supply chain appears secure under the reviewed conditions.",
