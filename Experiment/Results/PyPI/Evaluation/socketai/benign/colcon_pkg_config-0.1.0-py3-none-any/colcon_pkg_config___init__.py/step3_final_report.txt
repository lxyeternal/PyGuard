  "purpose": "Declare package version metadata in a Python module.",
  "sources": "None; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version string assignment (__version__ = '0.1.0') with licensing comments. There are no input sources, data processing, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The code is a standard pattern for Python package version declaration, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning high confidence scores and zero malware/security risk scores. The simplicity and static nature of the code confirm its harmlessness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. All assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
