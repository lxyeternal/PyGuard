  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",

  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code; only a version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment, copyright notice, license statement, and a simple assignment to __version__. There are no input/output operations, no external data reads, no code execution, and no malicious constructs. The only action is setting a version string, which is standard practice for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare a version number for the package. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
