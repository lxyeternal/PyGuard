  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or system interaction, but without the actual code provided, the specific intent cannot be determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, potentially user input, or external files (exact sources unspecified due to missing code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but specifics are unavailable without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks potentially via intermediate processing functions, but exact paths cannot be identified without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code; common suspicious signs such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are not evident.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis as the code was not provided. Normally, this would include inspecting for malicious functions, suspicious imports, unusual control flow, or obfuscated sections. Without code, analysis remains high-level and speculative.",
  "conclusion": "There is insufficient information to determine if the code contains malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are observable without the actual code content.",
