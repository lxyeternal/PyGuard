  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but the specific functionality is not clear due to missing or incomplete code snippets.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from variables, environment variables, and potentially external sources such as files or network if present. Exact sources are not specified due to missing code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data output functions, but exact locations cannot be determined without the full code.",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths cannot be fully established due to incomplete code; no explicit data flows identified in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features detected due to incomplete code. Lack of context prevents detection of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is incomplete or missing, limiting the ability to analyze data flow, sources, sinks, or anomalies. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are evident in the fragments available. Without additional code, cannot determine malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the partial code provided, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign but is incomplete, so a definitive assessment cannot be made. Additional code is needed for a thorough review.",
