  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard filesystem check and environment modification",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that checks for the existence of a specific .pc file in a package directory. If found, it prepends this directory to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable using a standard hook. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. External functions are assumed safe. The logic is straightforward and typical for environment setup scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard environment extension snippet used in build systems. It performs filesystem checks and conditionally modifies environment variables without any malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
