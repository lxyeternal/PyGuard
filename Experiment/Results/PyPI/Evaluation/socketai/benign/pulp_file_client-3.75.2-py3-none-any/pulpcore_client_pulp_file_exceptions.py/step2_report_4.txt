  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard exception hierarchy for API error handling.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Very low, as the code is utility-focused without any malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, standard exception classes.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The logic is consistent and typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 seem correct.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; purely error handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, benign code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Exception classes parsing HTTP responses.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; standard error processing.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Exception classes with message formatting.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The code is conventional.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem suitable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just error messaging.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar exception hierarchy.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) for some reports, reflecting minimal risk associated with error message handling but no real security threat.\n\n### My final estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential data leakage in error messages, but overall very low)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe utility for API error handling, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The low risk score is appropriate given the context.",
