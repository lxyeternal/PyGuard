  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code and the provided assessments, and then synthesize an overall security estimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and helper functions for error handling in an OpenAPI context. No malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- **Source & Sink:** Standard data flow; decoding response data is typical and not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no external network activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** 0.1 risk, 0 malware, high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is utility-focused, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is for structured error handling with no malicious intent.\n- **Source & Sink:** No external inputs or outputs; purely internal exception handling.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** 0 risk, 0 malware, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, standard exception classes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed, noting that the code extracts data from HTTP responses and constructs detailed error messages.\n- **Source & Sink:** Potentially sensitive data could be included in error messages, but this is typical for debugging and not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no data exfiltration, no code injection, just error formatting.\n- **Scores:** 0 risk, 0 malware, confidence 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The handling of response data is standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on exception classes and message formatting, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Source & Sink:** Data from parameters used to generate error messages.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** 0 risk, 0 malware, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical error handling utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing safe error handling and no malicious activity.\n- **Source & Sink:** Standard data flow; no external or malicious data processing.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** 0 risk, 0 malware, confidence 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely for exception handling, with no executable or network operations, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports; consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, sabotage, or vulnerabilities, a risk score of 0.1 in some reports seems slightly conservative but acceptable considering potential information leakage in error messages. However, since the code does not perform any dangerous operations, a more appropriate risk score would be **0.0**.\n- **Security implications:** No signs of supply chain sabotage, malicious code, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** **0.0** (no inherent security risk in this utility code)\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, benign component of an API client library, serving to manage exceptions and error reporting safely.",
