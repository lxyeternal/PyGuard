{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various API-related errors and a utility function for rendering error paths, likely used for error handling in an OpenAPI client library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (e.g., error messages, HTTP response objects, paths) and possibly from the 'http_resp' object's data attribute.",
  "sinks": "The code writes error messages to exception strings and may access attributes of HTTP response objects to extract response data.",
  "flows": "Error conditions trigger creation and raising of specific exception classes, passing in data from HTTP response objects or function parameters, and using 'render_path' to format error paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected. The code is straightforward error handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on defining exception classes for API error handling, with methods to include detailed error information such as HTTP status, reason, headers, and response body. The 'render_path' function formats error paths for debugging. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage. The exception hierarchy and response parsing appear standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API error handling module with no malicious intent. It is used for managing exceptions in an API client context. No malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks are identified.",
