  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is purely exception class definitions and a helper function, with no malicious code or logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified; the reasoning correctly states that this is standard error handling code.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.1, which seems reasonable given the code's utility nature.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code only handles exceptions and decodes response bodies without executing or manipulating untrusted data maliciously, the low risk score is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; standard exception classes with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues; reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores at 0, security risk minimal.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code reads data from HTTP response objects and constructs detailed error messages, which could potentially expose sensitive information if misused.\n- **Potential concern:** The decoding of `http_resp.data` could leak sensitive data if error messages are logged or exposed publicly.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes that the code doesn't perform malicious actions but points out that error messages could include sensitive data.\n- **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0.1, acknowledging potential information leakage if error data is mishandled.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code itself doesn't exfiltrate data or execute malicious actions, but could inadvertently leak sensitive info via error messages, a low but non-zero security risk score is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, but caution is warranted in how error messages are handled.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Standard exception handling and error message formatting.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to others; exception classes with no malicious code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with previous assessments; malware and obfuscated scores at 0, security risk low.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature as error handling utility, the risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, primarily due to potential inadvertent exposure of sensitive data via error messages, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for API error handling.\n- No signs of supply chain sabotage, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The only concern is the handling and exposure of potentially sensitive data in error messages, which is a common risk in error reporting but not malicious.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the code's utility nature, with minimal security concern primarily related to error message handling, not malicious activity.",
