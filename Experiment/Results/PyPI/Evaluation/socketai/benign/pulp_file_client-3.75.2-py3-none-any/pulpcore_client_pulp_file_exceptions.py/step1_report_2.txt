{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling various API errors and exceptions in a generated OpenAPI client library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, string messages, and HTTP response data. It does not read external inputs during execution; all data are internal or from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform actions based on external inputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; exception handling and string formatting are internal operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for error handling in an API client.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of exception classes for API error handling, including detailed messages and HTTP response parsing. The render_path function creates string representations of data paths. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are evident. The design appears typical for an auto-generated API client library, with no external data access or code execution occurring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for structured error handling and does not contain malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of an API client framework.",
