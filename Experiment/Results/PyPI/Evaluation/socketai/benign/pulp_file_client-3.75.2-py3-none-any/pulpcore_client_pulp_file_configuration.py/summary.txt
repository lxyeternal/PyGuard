  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration class for an API client. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor risks relate to potential misconfiguration, which is common in such flexible setups. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1–0.2) are appropriate and justified."
