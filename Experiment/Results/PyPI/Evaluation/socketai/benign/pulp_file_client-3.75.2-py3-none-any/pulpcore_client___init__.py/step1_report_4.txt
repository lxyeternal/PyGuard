{
  "purpose": "The code extends the package's __path__ attribute using pkgutil.extend_path, typically to support namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existing __path__ and __name__ variables; no external input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads __path__ and __name__, then assigns the extended path back to __path__, with no external data flow or injection.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; it does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function to extend the package's __path__, a standard practice for namespace packages. It does not perform any data processing, input handling, or malicious operations. The code's structure is simple and legitimate for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. The code is a standard package setup snippet.",
