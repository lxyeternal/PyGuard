{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic API response object model using Pydantic for serialization and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, and pydantic modules; class and field definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or execute untrusted data or perform I/O beyond data modeling.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not involve data flow from source to sink, it only defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a generic data model with type parameter T, and sets up fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. The model config allows arbitrary types, which is standard for flexible data models. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or sensitive operations. The code is purely for data structure definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of an API response model using Pydantic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
