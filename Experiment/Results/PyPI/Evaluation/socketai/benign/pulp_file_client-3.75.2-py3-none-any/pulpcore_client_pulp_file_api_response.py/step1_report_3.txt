{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model for deserializing HTTP responses using pydantic.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data is expected to come from HTTP responses processed by the application.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code simply defines a data model without executing or processing data beyond field declarations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow beyond model definition.",
  "anomalies": "The 'model_config' attribute is not in the correct pydantic configuration format (should be inside 'Config' class), but this is likely a mistake rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic pydantic model 'ApiResponse' with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. It imports standard typing and pydantic modules, and specifies type constraints. The 'model_config' is improperly defined outside the 'Config' class, which is a typical pydantic configuration pattern; this could lead to incorrect model behavior but is not malicious. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious logic. No input/output, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be a straightforward, type-safe data container for API responses, with a minor configuration mistake rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pydantic model for API responses with no malicious behavior. The only concern is the incorrect placement of 'model_config', which is a coding mistake rather than malicious code. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
