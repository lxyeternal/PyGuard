{
  "purpose": "Define a generic API response data model using Pydantic for type validation and structured data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing module, and Pydantic library; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input directly or write data to external systems.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'arbitrary_types_allowed' in model_config is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type-safe data model for API responses, leveraging Pydantic's features for validation. It uses generic typing to allow flexibility in data payloads. The configuration allows arbitrary types, which could be risky if untrusted types are used, but in this context, it seems intentional for flexibility. No input processing or external interactions are evident, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a data model for API responses without any malicious intent or security issues. It serves its purpose for structured data validation and serialization.",
