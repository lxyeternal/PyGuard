  "purpose": "Define a generic API response object with type safety using pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "targets": "None; there are no sinks that handle untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type-safe data model for API responses using pydantic, with fields for status code, headers, data, and raw data. It uses type annotations and optional fields appropriately. The 'model_config' setting allows arbitrary types but does not introduce any malicious behavior. No code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of a generic API response model with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
