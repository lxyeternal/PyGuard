{
  "purpose": "Defines a generic API response data model using pydantic for structured data validation.",
  "sources": "Input data from external HTTP responses (status_code, headers, raw_data, and data).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; data is stored in attributes but not used in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external HTTP responses into model attributes: status_code, headers, raw_data, and data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscation, and no malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a pydantic BaseModel with generic typing, intended for serializing/deserializing API responses. It imports necessary modules, defines a generic type variable, and specifies fields with type validation. The model_config allows arbitrary types, which is standard for flexible data models. No input sanitization, network calls, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data model with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It effectively structures API responses for use within larger applications without exposing any attack surface.",
