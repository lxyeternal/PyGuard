  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is purely static, consisting of import statements for SDK setup. There are no dynamic elements, user inputs, network calls, or data processing. The code is auto-generated boilerplate for SDK initialization.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is static, safe, and typical for SDK setup. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. These seem reasonable given the static import structure.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code contains no runtime logic, no user input handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution, there is no basis for assigning a high security risk score. The risk scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated/malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code as static and safe, with no signs of vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\nGiven the nature of the code, which is a static, auto-generated SDK setup module, there is no reason to assign any higher scores. It is a standard, safe boilerplate with no suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0            | No malicious code or behavior present.                        |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            | Clear, straightforward import statements.                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0            | No vulnerabilities, dynamic code, or data handling.          |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, standard, and poses no security concerns.**",
