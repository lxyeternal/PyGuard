  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ across multiple directories.",
  "sources": "Variables __path__ and __name__ used in extend_path call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "extend_path(__path__, __name__) modifies __path__ based on existing __path__ and __name__.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a standard pattern with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports extend_path from pkgutil and updates __path__ to support namespace packages, a common and benign pattern. No external inputs, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All reports correctly identify this pattern as standard and safe. The code's simplicity and adherence to Python packaging conventions confirm the absence of security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
