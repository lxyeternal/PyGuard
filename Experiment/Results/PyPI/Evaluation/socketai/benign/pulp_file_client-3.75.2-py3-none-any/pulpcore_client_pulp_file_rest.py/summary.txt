  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard HTTP client implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The minimal validation of proxy URLs is a minor concern but does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting a very low risk primarily due to configuration validation considerations."
