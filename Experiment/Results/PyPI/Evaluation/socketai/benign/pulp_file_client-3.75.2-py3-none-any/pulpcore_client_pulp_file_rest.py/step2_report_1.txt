  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard HTTP client with no malicious behaviors. It handles SSL, proxies, request methods, and content types appropriately.\n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns. Proxy URL validation is simple string matching, which is not inherently malicious.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical HTTP client with no evident malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request handling, proxy support, and SSL configuration. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Findings:** Proxy URL validation is basic; no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Both malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is low.\n- **Assessment:** Well justified. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard HTTP client with configurable SSL and proxy support. No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Findings:** Proper handling of request types, SSL, and proxies. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0; security risk is low.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs an HTTP client with flexible proxy and SSL configurations. Proxy URL validation only checks protocol schemes.\n- **Potential Concern:** The only point of concern is that proxy URLs are accepted from external input without full validation. Malicious proxy URLs could potentially redirect traffic or facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks.\n- **Analysis:** While the code itself does not perform malicious actions, the minimal validation of proxy URLs could be exploited if malicious URLs are supplied. However, this is a configuration issue rather than malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, which is correct; security risk is 0.2, reflecting the minimal validation concern.\n- **Justification:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the potential for misconfiguration, but not malicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious behavior is present, but the minimal validation could be flagged as a minor security concern. The score reflects this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard HTTP client implementation with support for proxies and SSL.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is low.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Most are 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about proxy URL validation, which is acceptable.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minor concern about minimal validation of proxy URLs, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\nThe reports are consistent, justified, and thorough. The only slight concern is the minimal validation of proxy URLs, which is not malicious but could be improved for security hardening.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no significant revisions are necessary.",
