  "purpose": "A subclass of email.message.EmailMessage for parsing and constructing inbound email messages, handling headers, MIME parts, attachments, and inline content.",
  "sources": "Raw MIME strings, bytes, or file-like objects; email headers and MIME parts",
  "sinks": "Payload extraction, attachment creation, header parsing, MIME structure assembly",
  "flows": "Input MIME/raw data -> parsing into EmailMessage structure -> extraction of headers, body, attachments",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding for attachments is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; warnings for deprecated properties are benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured email message handler designed for inbound email processing. It includes parsing raw MIME data, handling headers, MIME parts, and attachments, with no signs of malicious behavior. The use of decoding functions and MIME handling is typical for email processing. No backdoors, network activity, or suspicious logic are present. The deprecated warnings are benign. The overall flow and structure are consistent with secure email handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard email parsing and construction utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor security risk scores reflect inherent risks in processing untrusted email content, which are typical and not indicative of vulnerabilities.",
