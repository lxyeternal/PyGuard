  "purpose": "Define a subclass of email.message.EmailMessage for parsing, constructing, and handling inbound email messages with additional attributes and convenience methods.",
  "sources": "Reads headers and body content from email MIME parts, input strings or byte streams for parsing, uploaded files for constructing attachments, and raw header strings for message construction.",
  "sinks": "Returns email message components, raw payload bytes, text content, or uploaded files; also sets headers and payloads during message construction.",
  "flows": "Input data from parsing functions (strings, bytes, files) flows into EmailMessage construction or parsing routines, which set headers and MIME parts; attachments and content are built and accessed via properties and methods, with some base64 decoding and email parsing involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn for deprecated properties; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious URL or network activity; file reading and MIME processing are standard; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present; content decoding and MIME structure management appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation for handling inbound email messages, including parsing raw MIME data, constructing MIME messages, and managing attachments and inline parts. It utilizes standard Python email libraries and Django components securely. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, network activity, or data exfiltration. Deprecated warnings do not introduce risks. The functions perform safe string and byte handling, MIME parsing, and file management without suspicious code or external calls. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, purpose-specific, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements email parsing and construction functionalities securely and without malicious behavior. It uses standard libraries appropriately, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
