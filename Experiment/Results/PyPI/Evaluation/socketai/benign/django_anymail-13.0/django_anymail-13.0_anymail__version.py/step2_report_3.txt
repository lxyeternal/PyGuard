  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code assigns a static version string `__version__ = \"13.0\"`.\n- It then splits this string by commas: `VERSION = __version__.split(\",\")`.\n- The version string contains no commas, so `VERSION` will be a list with a single element: `[\"13.0\"]`.\n- The code is static, with no input/output, dynamic execution, or external data handling.\n- The comments advise against direct import, but this is just guidance, not a security concern.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Correctly notes that splitting by comma on a version string without commas is unusual but not malicious.\n- Confidence 0.9; malware 0; security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also correctly states that splitting by comma yields a list with the entire string.\n- Confidence 1; malware 0; security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: benign, straightforward assignment, no malicious activity.\n- Confidence 1; malware 0; security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar reasoning; static code, no external input, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence 1; malware 0; security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also finds no malicious behavior, just a static version assignment.\n- Confidence 1; malware 0; security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign.\n- The main anomaly is the use of `split(\",\")` on a version string that does not contain commas. This is likely a coding oversight or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final scoring considerations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The splitting operation is unnecessary but not harmful.\n- The comments about not importing directly are just documentation, not security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, with a minor anomaly in the splitting operation that does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall assessment aligns with the code's actual behavior. No malicious activity or security risk exists.",
