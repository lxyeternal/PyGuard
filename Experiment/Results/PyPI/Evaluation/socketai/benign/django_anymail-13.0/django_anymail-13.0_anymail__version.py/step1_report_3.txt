  "purpose": "Store and expose version information for the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__, and split operation on version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths that handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Simple version string assignment; no anomalies, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string for a Python package. It includes a comment warning against direct import and suggests loading version info from the package root. The __version__ variable is statically assigned a string. The VERSION variable attempts to split __version__ by comma, but since __version__ contains only a string with a dot-separated version number, splitting by comma results in a list containing the entire version string as a single element. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code performs a straightforward assignment and string operation, with no external input or untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily storing version information with no malicious intent or security risks.",
