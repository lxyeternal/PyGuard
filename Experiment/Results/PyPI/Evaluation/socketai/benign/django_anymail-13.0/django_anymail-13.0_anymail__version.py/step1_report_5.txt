  "purpose": "Define version information for the Python package without importing the file directly.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "The __version__ string is split into a list assigned to VERSION, but this is a benign operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a comment warning against direct import and notes about version string formatting. No suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it assigns a version string to __version__, then splits this string by commas and assigns the result to VERSION. No user input, environment variables, network calls, or file operations are present. The comment suggests intended usage guidelines, but no malicious behavior or security risks are introduced. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It only defines version info and includes comments for proper usage.",
