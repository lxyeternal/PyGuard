{
  "purpose": "The code provides version information for a Python package, indicating its version number and splitting it into parts.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ string and the split operation on it.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely assigns and processes a static string.",
  "anomalies": "The 'VERSION' variable is derived from splitting __version__, but the string does not contain commas; this may lead to unintended behavior, but it's not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, then splits this string by commas into the VERSION list. Since the version string is hardcoded and static, there are no untrusted inputs or suspicious behaviors. The comment suggests not to import this file directly, indicating it’s meant for internal use. There is no malware or security risk present. The only minor anomaly is that splitting by comma yields a list containing the entire string, as no commas are in the version string.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version info module with no malicious intent or security issues. The only notable aspect is the splitting of a version string without commas, which does not pose a security risk.",
