  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package, providing a version string and splitting it into parts.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment from a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to __version__, then splitting into list in VERSION.",
  "anomalies": "The use of split(',') on a version string that typically does not contain commas is unusual and likely a mistake but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a version string and splits it into parts. There is no input/output, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. The split operation may be improperly used since the version string does not contain commas, but this is likely a coding mistake rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves to manage version info. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
