  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the correctness of their assessments.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code assigns a static version string to `__version__`.\n- It then splits this string by commas and assigns the result to `VERSION`.\n- The version string `\"13.0\"` does not contain commas, so splitting by comma results in a list with a single element: `[\"13.0\"]`.\n- There are no untrusted inputs, no dynamic code execution, no external data processing, and no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Evaluations:\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- Correctly notes that the split operation is unusual since the version string doesn't contain commas.\n- Correctly states that the code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n- Confidence is high (0.9), which is reasonable.\n- Malware score is 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- Also correctly identifies the static assignment and the unlikely use of split.\n- Correctly states no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence is 1, which is appropriate.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- Similar reasoning; no malicious activity.\n- Correctly points out that splitting by comma on a version string without commas is harmless.\n- Confidence 1, malware 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- Recognizes the static nature and comments about intended usage.\n- Correctly states no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence 1, malware 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- Same reasoning; straightforward static assignment.\n- No malicious activity.\n- Confidence 1, malware 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and not malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is splitting a version string without commas, which is harmless.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk present.\n\n**Additional note:** The split operation on a version string that doesn't contain commas is likely a coding mistake or oversight, but it does not introduce any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments.",
