  "purpose": "Store version information as a static string and split it into a list.",
  "sources": "No external input; static assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Assignment of __version__ to a string, then splitting into VERSION list.",
  "anomalies": "Unnecessary split operation on a version string without commas; likely a coding oversight.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string '13.0' to __version__, then splits it by commas, resulting in a list with a single element. No external inputs, dynamic code, or malicious behavior are present. The split operation is redundant but harmless. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code comments suggest internal use, not security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate given the benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and free of malicious intent. The only anomaly is the unnecessary split operation, which does not impact security. The assigned scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
