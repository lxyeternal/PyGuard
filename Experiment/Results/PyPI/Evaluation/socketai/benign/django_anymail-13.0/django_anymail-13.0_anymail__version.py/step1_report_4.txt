  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, indicating not to import this file directly except by build systems.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ string and splitting it into VERSION list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to output; only static assignment and string splitting.",
  "anomalies": "The comment suggests the file is meant to be used as metadata, but there's no suspicious or unusual code behavior or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, then splits it into a list called VERSION. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward, static, and contains no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, static version info definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. The code appears benign and purely informational.",
