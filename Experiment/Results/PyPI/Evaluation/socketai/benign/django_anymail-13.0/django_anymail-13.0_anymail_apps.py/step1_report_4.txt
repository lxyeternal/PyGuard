  "flows": "Initialization of AppConfig, registration of checks during application startup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and custom check functions, then registers these checks in the 'ready' method of the AppConfig subclass. The purpose appears to be to perform system checks for deprecated or insecure settings. No external data sources, user input, or potentially malicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard Django practices without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django app configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves to register system checks for the 'anymail' application, which is common practice. No malicious activity or supply chain attacks are evident.",
