{
  "purpose": "Configure the Django application 'anymail' and register custom system checks",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django AppConfig, checks, and local check functions; method 'ready' registering checks",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "Imports and registration of check functions during application startup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward registration of check functions without suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django application configuration class, registering two custom check functions during startup. These functions are presumably for system checks related to deprecated or insecure settings. The code uses standard Django practices, imports only necessary modules, and registers checks appropriately. No hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or suspicious behavior is present. The check functions themselves are not included, so their content cannot be analyzed, but the registration process is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Django application configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It properly registers system checks and does not contain any suspicious or obfuscated code.",
