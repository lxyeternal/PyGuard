{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django AppConfig subclass that registers custom security check functions during app startup.",
  "sources": "Imports check functions from the local '.checks' module; registers them in the 'ready()' method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, or network operations; registration functions are not sinks.",
  "flows": "The 'ready()' method calls 'checks.register()' with check functions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django app configuration that registers security checks. It does not process untrusted data, contain hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The check functions' internal logic is unknown but their registration is benign. All reports correctly identify the code as standard, with no malicious activity. Malware scores are 0, obfuscation scores are 0, and security risk scores are minimal (~0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration registering security checks, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with its benign, straightforward nature.",
