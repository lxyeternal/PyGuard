{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django application configuration for 'anymail', registering security-related checks upon app readiness.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django modules and local check functions, and the 'ready' method that registers these checks.",
  "sinks": "The 'checks.register' calls potentially add check functions to Django's system, but they are standard Django practices and not sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Imports → AppConfig setup → 'ready' method execution → registration of check functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard Django patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass that registers custom security checks during application startup. It imports necessary modules and local check functions, then registers these functions in the 'ready' method. The pattern is typical for Django apps that include custom validation or security checks. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The check functions themselves are imported but their contents are not shown; based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django application configuration that registers security checks during startup. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code snippet.",
