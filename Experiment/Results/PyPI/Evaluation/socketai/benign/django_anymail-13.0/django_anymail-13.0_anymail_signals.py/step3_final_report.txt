  "purpose": "Define Django signals and data classes for email webhook event handling and normalization.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code defines signals and class constructors with kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely declarative definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code initializes class attributes from kwargs without external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard Django pattern usage, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of signal declarations and data classes for email event handling. It uses standard patterns, with no external data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The use of kwargs.pop() is safe and controlled. The constants for event types and reject reasons are straightforward. The code is static and declarative, serving as boilerplate for event normalization in Django. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security issues or malicious behavior. It functions as a safe, boilerplate setup for email webhook event handling within a Django application.",
