  "purpose": "Define signals and event classes for handling email webhook events in a Django application.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input reading functions or external data sources present)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no output functions or data leaks present)",
  "flows": "N/A (no untrusted data flow; the code primarily defines data structures and signals)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Django signal definitions and class structures for handling email events. No external data inputs are processed directly; no dynamic code execution, network connections, or sensitive data handling are present. The classes utilize straightforward initialization and constants to normalize event types and reject reasons. The signals are standard Django constructs for decoupled event handling. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for email event handling within a Django application. It only defines signals and data models with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal application logic.",
