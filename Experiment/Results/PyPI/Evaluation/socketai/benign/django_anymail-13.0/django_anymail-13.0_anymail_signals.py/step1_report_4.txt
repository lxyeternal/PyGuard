{
  "purpose": "Defines signal objects and event classes for handling email delivery, tracking, inbound, and other webhook events in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Data read from kwargs in class initializers, such as 'click_url', 'description', 'message', 'event_type', 'timestamp', etc.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data is used directly in dangerous operations or external calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from kwargs into class attributes; no external untrusted data sources are processed in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for structured event data and signal declarations in a Django context. All data is stored in class attributes, and no data processing involves external commands, file I/O, or network operations. The use of kwargs.pop ensures controlled extraction of data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code does not include any dynamic execution, system calls, or insecure data handling patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of event and signal structures for a Django email handling system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or supply chain attacks. It is standard boilerplate code for event modeling and signaling with no apparent security risks.",
