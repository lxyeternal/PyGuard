  "purpose": "Define Django signals and classes for handling and normalizing email webhook events from an email service provider (ESP).",
  "sources": "None explicitly read input or data within this code snippet. It defines event classes and signal objects for use elsewhere.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially dangerous data processing points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code sets up classes and signals but does not process external untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code or malicious payloads. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Django signal objects for pre- and post-send message hooks, and classes for normalized webhook event data structures. All classes primarily initialize data attributes with no external data processing or security-sensitive operations. No external inputs are read, and no data is sent to untrusted locations. The code is structured and clear, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured setup code for handling email webhook events within a Django application. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
