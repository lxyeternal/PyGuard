  "purpose": "Define Django signals and classes for normalized email webhook events in the Anymail package.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data from external sources; it only defines classes, constants, and signals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data to external systems or perform any data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Django signals for email event hooks and several classes representing normalized email event data and constants for event types and reject reasons. There are no data inputs, external calls, or execution flows that could be exploited maliciously. It does not handle untrusted data, does not perform network operations, and contains no hidden or suspicious logic. It appears to be standard, safe application code for event handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, standard definition of signals and classes for email webhook events. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is suitable for inclusion in a larger email handling application without concerns of supply chain security issues.",
