  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious behavior. They note that the code defines Django signals and data classes for email webhook events, with no external data processing, no network calls, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious patterns. The confidence levels are high (1), and malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not contain any actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. It is purely declarative, defining signals and data models.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No claims or assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code does not process external inputs directly, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- The use of `kwargs.pop()` is safe here, as it only extracts data into class attributes.\n- The signals are standard Django constructs, used for decoupled event handling.\n- No external dependencies or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The constants for event types and reject reasons are straightforward.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive reviews and the nature of the code, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n\n**However, to be thorough:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static setup for event handling in Django, with no external inputs, no code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. It’s boilerplate code for a well-understood pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code itself is safe, always ensure that in the broader application context, no external data is processed insecurely or passed into these classes without validation. But based solely on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
