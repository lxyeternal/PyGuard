{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and constants for handling email webhook events and signals in a Django application, primarily for normalized event data processing.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters (kwargs in constructors), class attributes, and imported modules (django.dispatch.Signal). No external input sources or untrusted data sources are directly present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage, system command execution, or external network connections are present. No sensitive data handling or output is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes and constants; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code uses standard Django signal patterns and class definitions without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of signal declarations and data classes for structured event handling, with no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. All classes are straightforward, and constants are defined for event types and reject reasons. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation for event normalization and signal handling in a Django email webhook context. No malicious intent or security issues are identified.",
