  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining Django signals and data classes for email webhook event handling.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code execution, network calls, or data sinks are present.\n- The code is straightforward, using standard patterns for signals and data models.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is purely declarative, defining signals and classes. No issues with the code logic or security are apparent.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no code performs external calls, executes dynamic code, or handles untrusted input in a dangerous way.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Supply chain risk:** No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code relies on well-known Django patterns.\n- The constants and classes are straightforward and serve as data containers.\n- No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores and justifications:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1 | 0 | 0 | No malicious behavior, no external data, no obfuscation. |\n| 2 | 0 | 0 | Same as above; standard definitions, no external or dangerous operations. |\n| 3 | 0 | 0 | Clear, safe data class and signal definitions. |\n| 4 | 0 | 0 | No external input, no code execution, no suspicious logic. |\n| 5 | 0 | 0 | Pure setup code, no signs of malicious activity. |\n\nAll scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent, which is consistent with the code.\n- No hidden or obfuscated code is present that could conceal malicious payloads.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic execution or external data processing.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard implementation of event signals and data classes for email webhook handling in Django. No security issues or supply chain risks are present.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that this code is used in a trusted environment and that any external data passed into these classes or signals is validated appropriately elsewhere in the application.",
