  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a benign set of class definitions and signal declarations for email event handling. No external input, data flow, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the absence of external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, straightforward class and signal definitions with no external data processing or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—class definitions and signals with no external data flow or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with others—defining signals and event classes without external input or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code content:** All reports describe standard Django signal and class definitions for email webhook event normalization.\n- **External data:** No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, no sensitive data handling.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Supply chain risk:** No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation, the overall security risk remains **very low**, ideally **< 0.1**.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation for email event handling within a Django application. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as such.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (or very close to zero)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
