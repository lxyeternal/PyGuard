  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, defining Django signals and data classes for email webhook event normalization.\n- No external input handling, dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- The code uses straightforward class initialization and constants.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be to provide structured event data and signaling within a Django email handling system.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is purely declarative, defining signals and classes. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None detected. The code is standard for event handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The code is minimal and well-structured; no flaws are evident.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code relies on proper use elsewhere but that is outside this snippet.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Not applicable; the code is benign and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious payloads.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and justified given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on all the reports and my review, I concur that this code is safe, standard boilerplate for event signaling in a Django application, with no security issues or malware.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no evidence of supply chain security issues, malware, or obfuscation. It is a straightforward, well-structured implementation for email event handling.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that the code consuming these signals and classes is similarly secure and free of vulnerabilities. But based solely on this snippet, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
