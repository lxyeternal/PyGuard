  "purpose": "This code performs checks on Django settings related to the 'anymail' package to identify deprecated or insecure configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads Django settings, specifically 'ANYMAIL', 'WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION', 'ANYMAIL_WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION', and 'DEBUG_API_REQUESTS' via 'get_anymail_setting' and 'settings' attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code issues warnings and errors based on the settings, primarily to notify about deprecated or insecure configurations. No actual data flow to external systems is present.",
  "flows": "Input: Settings data from Django configuration files. Output: Errors or warnings generated to inform the developer of issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior detected. The code performs straightforward configuration validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that perform configuration checks for deprecation and security issues within Django settings related to 'anymail'. It correctly flags deprecated setting names and potential security risks such as enabling debug API requests in production. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is clear and adheres to standard practices for configuration validation, with no suspicious patterns or code injections.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration validation script for Django settings, aiming to prevent deprecated or insecure configurations related to 'anymail'. There is no indication of malware or malicious intent.",
