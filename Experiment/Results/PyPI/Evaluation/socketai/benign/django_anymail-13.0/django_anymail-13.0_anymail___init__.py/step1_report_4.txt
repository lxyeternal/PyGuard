  "purpose": "This code defines and exports version information for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading version constants from the local module ._version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious output points",
  "flows": "Version data flows from the imported module to the exported __all__ list",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import and export statements with no dynamic or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports version identifiers from a local module, then declares them in __all__ for export. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The code does not perform any data manipulation, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The structure is straightforward and consistent with standard version management practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign version management code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
