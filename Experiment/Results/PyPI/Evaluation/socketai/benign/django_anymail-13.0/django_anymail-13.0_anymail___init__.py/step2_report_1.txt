  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe the code as a straightforward import and export of version constants from a local module, with no external data, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior. The code snippet itself is minimal and standard, and I see no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a simple version declaration pattern, with no anomalies or suspicious elements. There are no logical errors or misinterpretations in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a confidence of 1, and scores for obfuscated code, malware, and security risk are all zero. This aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. These scores seem reasonable and appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is purely for version management and involves no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data leakage, the risk scores are correctly set to zero. There is no justification for higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNone of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they all conclude that the code is standard and safe.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\nThe code is a standard version declaration pattern with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, simple, and standard. No modifications needed.",
