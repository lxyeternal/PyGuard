The structure is standard and minimal, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated logic. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and appears safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
