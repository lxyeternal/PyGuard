  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward import of version constants from a local module, with no external data, dynamic code, or suspicious activity. The code structure is standard for version management.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, standard, and free of anomalies or malicious intent. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.  \n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate; no flaws detected.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.  \n- **Malware:** All assign 0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is a simple version import with no external input, dynamic code, or network activity, the risk score should remain at 0. The reports' scoring is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize the code's benign nature based on its structure.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis, correctly reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe version declaration pattern with no security risks or malicious activity.**",
