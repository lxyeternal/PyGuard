  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simply importing version constants from a local module and exporting them via `__all__`.\n   - The original code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, no external input, and no network operations.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity in any report.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that the code is standard version management code, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any vulnerability or malicious activity that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is a simple version declaration pattern, common in Python packages.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or external communication.\n   - The malware score is justified as zero.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's straightforward nature.\n   - Their conclusions are justified based on the code content.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - Given the analysis, the scores accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nConsidering all the above, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard version management pattern with no security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Value |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat.",
