  "purpose": "Import version constants from a local module and expose them via __all__ for package version management.",
  "sources": "Import statement from ._version module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed",
  "flows": "Import of VERSION and __version__ from local module; export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for exposing version information in a Python package. It imports constants from a local module and defines __all__ for exports. No external data, dynamic code, or network activity is involved. The code is clear, simple, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version management pattern with no security risks or malicious activity. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
