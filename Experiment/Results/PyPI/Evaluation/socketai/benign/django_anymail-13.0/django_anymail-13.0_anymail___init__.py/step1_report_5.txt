  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data leaks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import from local module → export via __all__ list",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version import and export setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information from a local module '_version', which is a common practice in Python packages to centralize version info. It then defines __all__ to specify what is publicly accessible. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a standard, minimal setup for exposing version variables.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version export setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply exposes version information and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
