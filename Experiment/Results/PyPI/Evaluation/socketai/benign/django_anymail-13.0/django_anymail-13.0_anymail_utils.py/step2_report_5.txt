  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for email, configuration, and data handling within Django. Inputs are function parameters, settings, and external modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct unsafe sinks; data flows from input parsing to internal structures and formatted outputs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The only potentially sensitive operation is decoding base64 in `get_request_basic_auth()`, which is standard for handling HTTP Basic Auth.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-structured, secure, no malicious behavior. Malware score: 0, risk: 0.1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar scope—utility functions for email, data merging, request parsing, settings retrieval.\n- No suspicious patterns, no code injection, no obfuscated code.\n- Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, minimal risk, malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Utility functions for email, attachments, merging, date parsing, request data.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Use of base64 is limited to email attachments, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Utility functions for email, merging, address parsing, configuration.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- Handles data securely, with validation and sanitation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, low security risk, malware score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Standard utility functions for email processing and configuration.\n- No malicious patterns, code injection, or suspicious behavior.\n- Uses safe practices, no network or system modifications.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, malware score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The only operation that involves decoding base64 is standard for HTTP Basic Auth, not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; code appears straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Overall, the code is utility and configuration handling, which is inherently low risk, especially given the thorough validation and sanitization.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal, standard utility code with no evident vulnerabilities)\n\nThis code appears safe, well-written, and free from malicious intent or sabotage.",
