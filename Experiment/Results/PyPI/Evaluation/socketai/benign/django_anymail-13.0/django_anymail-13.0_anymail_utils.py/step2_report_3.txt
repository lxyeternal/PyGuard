  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and overall security risk. We'll also verify if the scores assigned are reasonable based on the detailed descriptions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions/classes for email handling, config, data merging, date formatting, and request processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation indicated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for email, data, and request handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified as minimal risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned. Scores align with the description.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for email, data, and request processing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — still low, justified by the standard utility nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The detailed analysis confirms no malicious intent. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for email, config, data merging, and request parsing. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low, consistent with the benign description.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for email, data, and request handling. No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code, payloads, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, matching the straightforward, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), reflecting the utility nature and absence of security concerns.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code consists solely of utility functions and classes for email processing, configuration, and request handling.\n- No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code.\n- The decoding of base64 in `get_request_basic_auth()` is standard for handling HTTP Basic Auth, not malicious.\n- No data flows suggest malicious intent or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, justified by the nature of the functions, mainly data handling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears secure, benign, and free from obfuscation or malware.",
