  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for attaching inline images to email messages in Django, and manages email sending statuses and recipient statuses.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from disk via Path.read_bytes(), generates Content-ID headers, and attaches images inline to email messages.",
  "sinks": "Attaches MIMEImage objects to email messages; updates recipient status dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Reads image bytes from file path -> creates MIMEImage -> adds headers -> attaches to message; updates recipient statuses with message IDs and statuses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or code injection detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for inline image attachment and email status tracking. It reads image data from disk, generates Content-ID headers with make_msgid, and attaches images inline. Recipient statuses are validated and stored securely. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform network operations or handle sensitive data beyond email content and statuses. The use of a fixed domain 'inline' for message IDs is standard practice. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and employs standard email handling techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for inline image attachment and email status management in Django. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score reflects its utility nature and minimal security concerns.",
