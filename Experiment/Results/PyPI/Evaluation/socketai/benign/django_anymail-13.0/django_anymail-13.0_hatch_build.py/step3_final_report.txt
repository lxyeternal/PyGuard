  "purpose": "Update README content by replacing version-specific badges and links with the current project version during build.",
  "sources": "Reads README file from filesystem, accesses 'version' from metadata.",
  "sinks": "Modifies README text in memory before updating metadata; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> applies regex substitutions -> updates metadata with modified text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward regex replacements targeting known URL patterns; no secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file, uses regex to replace badge URLs and version links with the current version, and updates project metadata. It contains no network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. Regex patterns are simple and purpose-specific, targeting badge SVG URLs and documentation links. The code is a typical build hook for documentation versioning, with minimal security risk. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward build utility for updating version references in documentation. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The regex replacements are safe and targeted. All reports correctly identify its purpose and benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk associated with build scripts. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and appropriate for its purpose.",
