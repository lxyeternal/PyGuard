{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to modify README content dynamically by updating version-specific links within the README file based on the project's current version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README file from the filesystem using Path.read_text() and reads the project version from the metadata dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The modified README content is stored back into the metadata structure; no external data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README file, processes its text with regex substitutions to update version references, then stores the updated text back into the metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The regex substitutions are straightforward and related solely to updating version references.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a specific interface for metadata hooks. It defines a function to update version references in README text using regex, which appears to be safe and purposeful. The CustomMetadataHook class implements a method to read the README file, modify it, and update the metadata dictionary accordingly. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The regex patterns are designed solely for updating badge and link URLs based on project version tags. The overall structure is typical for a build hook intended for documentation management, with no suspicious or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign project build hook intended to update README references with the current project version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code.",
