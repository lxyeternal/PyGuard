{
  "purpose": "The code modifies README content by replacing version-specific links with the current project version, facilitating dynamic documentation updates during build processes.",
  "sources": "Reads the README file content from the filesystem using Path.read_text()",
  "sinks": "Returns modified README content in metadata; no external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Reads README file -> processes content with regex substitutions -> updates metadata with new README text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; regex operations are straightforward and contextually safe; no obfuscated code detected; no suspicious network activity or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for regex processing and filesystem access, then defines a function to replace version-specific links in README text. The class CustomMetadataHook updates project metadata by reading the README file, modifying links to reflect the current version, and embedding the updated content back into the metadata. The regex replacements are designed solely for updating version references in documentation URLs and badges, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code operates purely within the build environment and does not interact with external systems or network.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build-time utility for updating documentation links with the current project version. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on this analysis.",
