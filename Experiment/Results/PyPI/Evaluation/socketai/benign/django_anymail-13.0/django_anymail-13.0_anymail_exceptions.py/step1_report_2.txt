{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and helpers for error handling within the Anymail email-sending framework, mainly for improved error reporting and handling.",
  "sources": "Data is read from exception arguments, response objects, and internal attributes during error handling and reporting.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if response content or internal exception details are improperly exposed or logged; no explicit unsafe data sinks are directly present in the code.",
  "flows": "Exception data flows from raised exceptions through __init__ methods, with response details potentially formatted for output in __str__ and describe_response methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors such as code injection, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual operations are evident. The code primarily consists of exception class definitions and standard error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for the Anymail framework, enhancing error messaging and control flow. It uses standard Python practices for exception handling, message formatting, and response analysis. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. All operations are consistent with error reporting. The inclusion of detailed response descriptions and exception chaining is typical for robust error handling. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or obscure code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard and safe set of custom exception classes and helper utilities for a Django email framework. It performs detailed error descriptions but does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. Overall, it poses no security risks.",
