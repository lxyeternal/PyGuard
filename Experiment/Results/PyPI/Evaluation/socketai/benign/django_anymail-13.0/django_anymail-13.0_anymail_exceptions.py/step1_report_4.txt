{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and helpers for error handling within the Anymail Django email integration library.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class initializers and methods process exception data, response objects, and internal configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive information could be included in exception messages or logs, but no direct sinks like network or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with internal data; they format descriptive messages but do not execute external calls or modify system state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no unusual control flows. Exception handling is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Django email context, including detailed descriptions for API errors, invalid addresses, feature unsupported issues, serialization problems, and webhook validation failures. It also includes warning classes and a helper class. The exception classes capture internal state and response objects, formatting detailed error messages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to serve as structured error reporting and handling infrastructure, with no suspicious or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes and helpers for the Anymail library, with no indicators of malicious or sabotage behavior. It focuses on error reporting, with no network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious features. The overall security risk is very low.",
