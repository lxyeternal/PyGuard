  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the reasonableness of scores, and any potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes and warnings for error handling in Anymail, based on exception data and response objects.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. The code is primarily exception class definitions and response formatting.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard error handling code. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (low). These are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on custom exceptions, capturing error details, and formatting responses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is typical for structured error reporting.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-structured, safe, with no backdoors or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes, capturing error info, response data, and traceback details.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard error handling, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, exception classes, error info, and response formatting.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, no data leaks evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Straightforward error handling code, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0. Slightly lower risk, but consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes and warnings for error handling, similar pattern.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no suspicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard error handling, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports describe exception classes and error handling utilities for the Anymail package.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected in any report.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code is purely for error reporting and exception management.\n- **Scores:** Consistent and reasonable across all reports, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and low risk scores.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard error handling)\n\nThis code appears to be standard, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or security issues. The high confidence levels reflect the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of exception classes and warnings for error handling in the Anymail library. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
