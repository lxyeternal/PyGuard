{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and helper utilities for error handling and warnings within the Anymail package, specifically for email sending via various ESPs.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, exception handling, attribute access, and method calls such as response.json(), response.text, and response.reason.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data outputs include the formatted exception messages, response content, and JSON dumps in __str__, describe_response, and related methods.",
  "flows": "Exceptions may include response data in string representations; JSON responses are dumped in error descriptions; error messages incorporate response details and cause information.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behaviors are present; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code primarily defines exception handling and warning classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception hierarchy, mainly for handling errors related to email sending, API responses, and configuration issues. The __init__ methods store context data such as responses, messages, and backend info. Methods like __str__, describe_response, and describe_cause format exception and response details for debugging. No data leaks, code injections, or malicious activities are evident. The response handling relies on response attributes like json() and text, which are standard and safe. The _LazyError class defers errors until used, with no malicious behavior. Overall, the code functions as structured exception handling and logging without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard error handling framework for the Anymail package, providing detailed exception descriptions and warnings. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe, focusing on capturing and formatting error information.",
