  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and warnings for handling various errors and issues in the Anymail package, including API errors, invalid addresses, configuration issues, and webhooks.",
  "sources": "Exception initializers and methods that handle error information and response data, especially in AnymailError and its subclasses.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate string representations of exceptions, including response details and cause descriptions.",
  "flows": "Exception initialization and string formatting processes that incorporate response data and error causes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected. The code primarily consists of exception class definitions and standard error handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured framework for handling errors in the Anymail library, including detailed descriptions of API responses and error causes. It carefully manages response data, including decoding response reasons and JSON content. No indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior are present. The usage of standard library and third-party imports is appropriate, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious techniques. The presence of comprehensive error classes and warnings suggests robust error handling, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes and warnings for the Anymail package. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage. It focuses on error reporting and handling, with no suspicious activities detected.",
