{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes, warnings, and helper functions for error handling, response formatting, and error description within the Anymail package.",
  "sources": "Response objects (self.response), exception arguments (self.args), traceback information (format_exception_only), class attributes (self.backend, self.email_message, self.payload, self.status_code, self.esp_name).",
  "sinks": "Formatted error messages, response JSON or text, exception descriptions; potential exposure if logs are insecure, but no direct leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Exception initialization captures response and context; __str__ method constructs error message from args, cause, and response; describe_response formats response details; describe_cause extracts traceback info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard exception handling and response formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of exception classes and warnings for error reporting in the Anymail library. It handles error details, response descriptions, and traceback info in a straightforward manner. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security sabotage are present. The response formatting and exception handling are standard, with potential minor concerns about info leaks if logs are insecure, but this is outside the code's scope. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and risk as 0.1, reflecting minimal risk primarily related to potential data exposure in logs. The overall structure and logic are sound and typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured exception and warning framework for the Anymail package, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. The assigned scores are consistent with its purpose and implementation. No adjustments are necessary.",
