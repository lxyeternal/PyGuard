  "purpose": "Framework for defining custom Jinja2 tags with argument parsing and rendering logic.",
  "sources": "Parser stream reading tag name, arguments, and options; template name resolution via get_template/select_template.",
  "sinks": "Template rendering functions; potential for template injection if template names are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Parser stream inputs → argument parsing → template name selection → template rendering.",
  "anomalies": "Use of parser inputs for template names without validation; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard extension pattern for Jinja2, parsing arguments and rendering templates. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets. The only potential security concern is the use of user-controlled data for template names, which could lead to template injection if not validated. The code does not perform network access, file manipulation, or code injection. The deprecation warning indicates maintenance but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension framework with no malicious or obfuscated components. The main security consideration is ensuring that template names derived from external input are validated to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0; the overall security risk is low but slightly elevated (around 0.2 to 0.4) depending on input validation practices.",
