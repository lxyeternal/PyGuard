  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension framework with no malicious or obfuscated components. The main security consideration is ensuring that template names derived from external input are validated to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0; the overall security risk is low but slightly elevated (around 0.2 to 0.4) depending on input validation practices."
