  "purpose": "Define and assign the version number for the module or package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '0.0.162' to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the assignment of a version string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version assignment without any suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list __all__ containing '__version__', indicating which symbols are exported. It then assigns a string representing the version number to __version__. No external input, no obfuscated code, no malicious activity, and no risky behaviors observed. The structure is standard for Python packages to specify versioning and export symbols.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of the package version with no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
