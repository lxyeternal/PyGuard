  "purpose": "Define the package's version and specify exported symbols",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__, listing __version__ in __all__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external calls",
  "flows": "None; static data assignment only",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static declaration of __version__ as '0.0.162' and includes it in __all__. No dynamic behavior, input/output, external calls, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is standard for version declaration in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
