  "purpose": "Define a module version variable for package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code assigns a string to __version__ and lists __version__ in __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The module assigns a string to __version__, which is then included in __all__ for export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and declares an __all__ list containing __version__, which is standard for Python packages. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration typical for Python packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
