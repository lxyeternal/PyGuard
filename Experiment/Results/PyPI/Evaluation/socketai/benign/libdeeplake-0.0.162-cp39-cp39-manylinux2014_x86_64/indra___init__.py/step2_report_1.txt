  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple, static assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"0.0.162\"`) and a list (`__all__`) containing `__version__`. There are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output operations, no data flows, and no suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and standard for Python package version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious activity. No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n   Since all reports agree, there is no need to adjust scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   All scores are 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No malicious activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All assessments are based on the static, straightforward code. There are no assumptions that lead to false positives or negatives.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration typical for Python packages. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. No further action needed.",
