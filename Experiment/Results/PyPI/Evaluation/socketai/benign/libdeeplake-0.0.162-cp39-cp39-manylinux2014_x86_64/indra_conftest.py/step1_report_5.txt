  "purpose": "Configure environment variables and pytest test suite options for testing scenarios.",
  "sources": "Environment variable setting (os.environ), import statements, command line argument parsing (pytest_addoption), and test collection modification (pytest_collection_modifyitems).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data flows or sensitive data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variable is set at the start, but does not influence other code flows directly. Test options are added and modify test collection based on command line flags.",
  "anomalies": "The code sets an environment variable 'BUGGER_OFF' to 'true' without clear purpose, but this alone is not malicious. The import of 'deeplake.client.config' is done conditionally, which is benign. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic is evident. The setting of environment variables and pytest configuration appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets an environment variable 'BUGGER_OFF', potentially intended for controlling behavior elsewhere, but its purpose is unclear. It attempts to import a module and modify its configuration if available, which is a common pattern. The pytest hook functions add command line options and modify test collection behavior based on user input, which is standard test setup code. There is no evidence of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No suspicious network activity or harmful file operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The environment variable's purpose is unclear but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
