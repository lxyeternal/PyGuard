      "conclusion": "The code is benign test code with no malicious intent. The main issue is the presence of a hardcoded JWT token, which should be replaced with environment variables or secure storage in production. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; dynamic code execution in Report 3 warrants cautious scoring. Adjusting malware score to 0.3 and maintaining obfuscation at 0.4 provides a balanced assessment. Overall, the supply chain risk appears minimal, with no evidence of malicious sabotage."

The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the overall security risk negligible, approximately 0.05 to 0.1 to account for minor informational leaks via print statements. Therefore, the final evaluation confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use."
