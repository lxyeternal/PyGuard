{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from a local module named 'api' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the import does not directly lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No execution flow beyond the import statement; potential risk depends on 'api' contents.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which obscures imported symbols and can hide malicious code if 'api' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from 'api'. Wildcard imports are discouraged due to namespace pollution and maintainability issues. The snippet alone does not execute any malicious activity. The security implications depend on the trustworthiness of 'api'. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the import but note the risk associated with wildcard usage. Malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk scores are low (around 0.2-0.3), reflecting the potential for hidden malicious code if 'api' is compromised. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no further action is necessary beyond recommending avoiding wildcard imports for better security and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign but should be replaced with explicit imports to improve security and maintainability. The current scores are appropriate, with a low malware and obfuscation risk, and a moderate concern about the wildcard import practice.",
