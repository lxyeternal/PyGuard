  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local api module.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing code from a local module named 'api'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies detected in this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that brings in all definitions from a relative module named 'api'. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or execute any functions. The lack of additional code prevents identification of suspicious behavior or security issues. However, without seeing the contents of 'api', no further security assessment can be made. The import statement itself is common and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this line. It appears benign but limited information is available.",
