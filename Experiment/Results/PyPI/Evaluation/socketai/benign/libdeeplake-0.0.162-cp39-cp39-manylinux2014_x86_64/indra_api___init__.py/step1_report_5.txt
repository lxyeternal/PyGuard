{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the api module within the same package",
  "sources": "The code imports the api module, which may contain input handling or data processing functions",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this single line of import statement",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from a single import statement alone",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import, which can obscure the actual functions or data being imported, potentially hiding malicious functions or variables",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import from a local module. While this line by itself does not perform malicious actions, wildcard imports can introduce security risks by importing unintended or malicious code if the api module is compromised. Without seeing the content of the api module, it is impossible to determine if malicious code exists. The import may be benign or malicious depending on the module content. There is no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent solely from this import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement is not inherently malicious, but it raises concerns due to the use of a wildcard import which can conceal malicious code. Additional context or review of the api module is necessary for a definitive security assessment.",
