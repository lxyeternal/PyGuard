{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module named 'api', likely to use its functions or classes.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing code from the local module 'api'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, functions or data from 'api' could be used in insecure ways if misused elsewhere, but not directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows depend on the usage of imported entities; the snippet itself does not show data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses a wildcard import (*), which can obscure which functions or classes are brought into scope, potentially hiding malicious or unintended imports. No other code present to evaluate further.",
  "analysis": "This code only contains an import statement from a local module 'api' using a wildcard. While wildcard imports are generally discouraged due to readability and maintainability concerns, this line alone does not exhibit malicious behavior. There are no signs of code injection, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious activities in this single statement. The security implications depend on the contents of 'api', which are not provided. No anomalies such as obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident. Overall, this code snippet is minimal and does not pose an immediate security threat by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement using a wildcard from a local module. It does not show any malicious intent or suspicious activity on its own. Security risk is low, but the use of wildcard import could be considered poor practice for code clarity and maintenance.",
