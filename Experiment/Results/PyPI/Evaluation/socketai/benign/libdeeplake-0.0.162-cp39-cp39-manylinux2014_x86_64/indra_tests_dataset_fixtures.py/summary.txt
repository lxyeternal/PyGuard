  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test fixture setup with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The reliance on environment variables is typical but should be managed securely. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score of 0.2 reflecting typical environmental dependency."
