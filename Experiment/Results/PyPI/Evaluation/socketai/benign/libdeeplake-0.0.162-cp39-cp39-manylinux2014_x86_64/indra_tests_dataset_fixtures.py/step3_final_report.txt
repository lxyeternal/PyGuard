  "purpose": "Set up pytest fixtures for testing deeplake datasets, managing local paths, and retrieving credentials and tokens from environment variables for authorized dataset access.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ENV_HUB_DEV_USERNAME and ENV_ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN; local storage paths; dataset initialization via deeplake.dataset()",
  "sinks": "Dataset access functions that use tokens; environment variables for credentials",
  "flows": "Retrieval of credentials from environment variables -> assertion checks -> dataset initialization with tokens",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test setup involving environment variable checks, local path management, and dataset creation. It uses assertions to ensure credentials are present, clears local storage before and after tests, and initializes datasets with tokens. No malicious or suspicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on environment variables, which is common practice but should be secured externally. No obfuscation or malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test fixture setup with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The reliance on environment variables is typical but should be managed securely. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score of 0.2 reflecting typical environmental dependency.",
