  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard libraries and performs basic operations, possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input or variables defined within the script; no external data sources are explicitly identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements and file operations, but none seem to involve untrusted data or insecure handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to internal variables, with no evidence of untrusted data being passed to insecure sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed. The code structure is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows the code only performs basic operations, with standard library usage. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code does not connect to external servers, execute dynamic code, or access sensitive information insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is benign with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, harmless script with no supply chain threats detected.",
