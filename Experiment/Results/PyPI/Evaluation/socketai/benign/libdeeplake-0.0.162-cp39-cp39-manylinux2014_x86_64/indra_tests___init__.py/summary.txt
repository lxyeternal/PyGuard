  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; dynamic code execution in Report 3 warrants cautious scoring. Adjusting malware score to 0.3 and maintaining obfuscation at 0.4 provides a balanced assessment. Overall, the supply chain risk appears minimal, with no evidence of malicious sabotage."
