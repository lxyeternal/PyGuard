  "purpose": "Analyze Python code for potential malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, module imports, and dynamic execution functions such as eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous functions like eval/exec, network connections, file modifications, or data exfiltration points if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, env vars, dynamic code) through processing functions to sinks (execution points, network, file system).",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without sanitization, minimal comments, dynamic code execution, incomplete code snippets, or obfuscated code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are mostly benign, performing standard operations with no suspicious patterns. Report 3's use of eval/exec is flagged as suspicious; the malware score should be increased from 0.2 to 0.3 to reflect potential exploitation risk. Other reports show no anomalies, with scores appropriately low. The overall security risk remains moderate, primarily due to dynamic execution concerns, but no confirmed malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low security risk; dynamic code execution in Report 3 warrants cautious scoring. Adjusting malware score to 0.3 and maintaining obfuscation at 0.4 provides a balanced assessment. Overall, the supply chain risk appears minimal, with no evidence of malicious sabotage.",
