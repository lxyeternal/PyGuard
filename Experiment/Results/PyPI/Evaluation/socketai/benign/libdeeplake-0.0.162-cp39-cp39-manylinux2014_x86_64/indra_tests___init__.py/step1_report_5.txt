{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear due to the lack of comments or descriptive variable names, but it appears to be setting up environment variables and importing modules, possibly for data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (via os.environ), imports modules, and may include data from external sources through function calls or file access (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands (not explicitly visible). The code may pass data to such sinks if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or imported modules (sources) into functions or processes that could lead to network transmission, file modification, or command execution (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are present. The code structure appears straightforward but incomplete for full assessment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and accesses environment variables, which is normal. Without further code segments, it is challenging to identify malicious flows or anomalies. The absence of clear network operations, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns suggests low risk. However, incomplete information limits certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the incomplete nature warrants cautious review if more code exists.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
