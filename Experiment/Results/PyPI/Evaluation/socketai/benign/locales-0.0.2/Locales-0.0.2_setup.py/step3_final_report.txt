  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'Locales', used to configure package metadata and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, boilerplate code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script, importing setuptools, reading a markdown file for description, and calling setup() with static package info. No dynamic inputs, external data handling, or code execution are present. The code structure is simple, clear, and adheres to standard packaging practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk indicators. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
