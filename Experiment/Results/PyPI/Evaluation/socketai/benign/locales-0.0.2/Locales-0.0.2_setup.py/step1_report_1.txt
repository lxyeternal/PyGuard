{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package called 'Locales' with metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; no code execution, data transmission, or other sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "Reads external file -> assigns content to 'long_description' -> used in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs observed. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a Markdown file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata. No input validation, no dynamic code execution, no external data transmission. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for Python packaging. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely defines package metadata and configuration.",
