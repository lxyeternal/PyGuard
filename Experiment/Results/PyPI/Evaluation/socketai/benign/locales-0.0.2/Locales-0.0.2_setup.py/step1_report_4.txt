  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package called 'Locales' with metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.md' for long_description; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; no data leakage or malicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content, passes package metadata to setuptools.setup(), no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup process: reading a markdown file for description and configuring package metadata. All operations are standard and do not involve dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
