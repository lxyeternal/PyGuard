{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and imports for type annotations and compatibility across Python versions, likely as part of a larger library or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from standard modules such as sys, typing, and numpy. It also uses the __future__ import and imports various typing extensions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily sets up type annotations and imports.",
  "anomalies": "The extensive wildcard import from typing (*), which can introduce unused or ambiguous symbols, is a potential concern but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are detected. The code relies on standard modules and standard practices for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for type annotations, handles compatibility between Python versions, and defines several type aliases. The wildcard import from typing is not recommended but is not inherently malicious. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. It serves as a utility setup for type annotations. No network access, data processing, or code execution is involved. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility code segment for type handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for type annotations and compatibility. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The main concern is the wildcard import which could lead to namespace pollution, but this is a common pattern in utility modules and not malicious.",
