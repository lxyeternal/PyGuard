{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases, imports, and compatibility handling for Python versions, serving as a utility setup module for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, typing_extensions, and numpy; type variable and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static setup code with no data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from typing import *' with '# noqa: F403', which can cause namespace pollution but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility module focused on setting up type annotations and ensuring compatibility across Python versions. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which is a known style issue but not security-related. All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious, with malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The risk scores in the reports are slightly high (around 0.5), but given the benign nature, a lower risk score (~0.1 to 0.2) is more appropriate, primarily due to the wildcard import. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard setup module for type annotations and compatibility, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor concern about the wildcard import does not translate into security risk. The existing assessments are accurate; the risk score should be lowered to reflect the benign nature.",
