{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases and imports for type annotations and compatibility across Python versions, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules (sys, typing, types), numpy module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks related to external data or effects",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up type aliases and imports without any data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The script performs version-dependent imports to maintain compatibility, defines type aliases for JSON serialization and numpy data types, and suppresses certain static analysis warnings. It is a standard setup for type annotations with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup module for type annotations and compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
