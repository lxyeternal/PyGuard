{
  "purpose": "This code defines type aliases, imports, and constants related to type annotations and compatibility across Python versions for a larger project, likely aimed at ensuring consistent type hints and imports.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (sys, typing), third-party import (numpy)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points; the code only defines types and imports",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code primarily sets up type annotations and compatibility layers",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code uses wildcard imports with explicit noqa comments, which could be considered bad practice but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules based on Python version, defines various type aliases, and sets up constants for serialization and data types. No input handling, network access, or data manipulation occurs. It appears to be a standard setup module for type annotations and compatibility, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on setting up type annotations, imports, and compatibility. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
