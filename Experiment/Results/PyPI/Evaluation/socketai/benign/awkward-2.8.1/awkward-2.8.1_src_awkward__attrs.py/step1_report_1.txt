{
  "purpose": "Utility functions and class for managing attributes associated with objects, primarily for handling metadata or annotations in a data processing library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'attrs_of_obj', 'attrs_of', and the constructor of 'Attrs'; data iteration in 'attrs_of' and 'without_transient_attrs'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no sensitive data or untrusted input is written or transmitted outside the functions.",
  "flows": "Inputs are received via function parameters, processed (e.g., copying, filtering, or enforcing key types), and stored in internal data structures. There are no external network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors. Functions are straightforward, with standard data handling. The enforcement of string keys and handling of attributes are typical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for extracting, merging, and filtering attribute dictionaries, along with a class for encapsulating attribute data with enforced string keys. All operations are typical for metadata handling. No external calls, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and adheres to standard patterns. The enforcement of string keys helps prevent certain injection vulnerabilities, but this is a standard safety measure rather than a malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module for attribute management with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs standard data manipulation tasks safely.",
