  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for attribute handling with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are zero, and the slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report can be considered acceptable given the context. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
