  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for managing attributes associated with objects, including merging, filtering, and enforcing string keys.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, object attributes, and dictionary items.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary updates, object attribute access, and type enforcement functions that could potentially process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> data processing in attrs_of_obj, attrs_of, without_transient_attrs, Attrs class methods, and _enforce_str_key.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access; no obvious hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated segments; no network operations or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for managing attribute dictionaries, with functions to merge, filter, and enforce key types. The Attrs class encapsulates a dictionary with enforced string keys, preventing injection through key validation. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or system commands. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data leaks present. The flow of data is straightforward, with no evident data exfiltration, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured code for attribute management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard attribute management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe data handling, key enforcement, and attribute merging. No malware or suspicious activity detected.",
