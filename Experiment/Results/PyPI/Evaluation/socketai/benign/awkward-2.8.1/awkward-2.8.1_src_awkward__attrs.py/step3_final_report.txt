  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for attribute management, including extraction, merging, filtering, and encapsulation of attributes.",
  "sources": "Functions reading object attributes, dictionary items, and input parameters; no external data sources or network communication.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external sinks or data leaks; no network or file system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects or dictionaries through attribute extraction and merging functions, into internal attribute mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; enforcement of string keys is a standard safety measure; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward attribute management tasks with clear, standard Python constructs. It enforces string keys, merges attribute dictionaries, filters transient attributes, and encapsulates attribute data within a class. There are no external communications, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic. The functions are safe, well-structured, and typical for utility modules. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse if integrated into a larger, untrusted context, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for attribute handling with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are zero, and the slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report can be considered acceptable given the context. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
