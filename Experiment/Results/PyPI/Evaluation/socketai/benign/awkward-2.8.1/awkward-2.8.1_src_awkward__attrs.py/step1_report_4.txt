{
  "purpose": "This code manages attribute dictionaries for objects, providing functions to extract, merge, and filter attributes, and a class to encapsulate attribute data with enforced string keys.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (attrs, arrays, obj, data) and from within object methods, including attribute access and iteration.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to the internal _data dictionary within the Attrs class, and raises exceptions if invalid keys are used. No external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (attrs, array objects, data dictionaries) flows into functions attrs_of_obj and attrs_of, then into the Attrs class for encapsulation. Data is retrieved, merged, or filtered as needed, with no external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code follows standard patterns for attribute management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for managing attributes, including extraction from objects, merging multiple attribute sets, and filtering transient attributes. The Attrs class provides a standard dictionary-like interface with enforced string keys, raising exceptions on invalid keys. All data handling appears straightforward and safe, with no external communication or suspicious logic. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard attribute management logic with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or contain backdoors. The functions and class serve legitimate purposes within a larger codebase.",
