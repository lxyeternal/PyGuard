{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for managing attributes associated with objects, especially in the context of data structures such as arrays and records. It facilitates attribute retrieval, combination, and filtering of transient attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input objects such as arrays, records, and builders; it also accesses provided attribute mappings and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any clear sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. It performs data transformations and attribute manipulations without external communication or system modification.",
  "flows": "Attributes are read from objects or provided directly, potentially combined, filtered, or stored in a class. No external data is sent or used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, focused on attribute management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages attribute data, with functions to extract, combine, and filter attributes. It enforces string keys for attributes to prevent injection issues. The use of imports and data handling is safe and typical for data processing modules. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility module for attribute handling with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It adheres to safe coding practices and lacks suspicious behavior.",
