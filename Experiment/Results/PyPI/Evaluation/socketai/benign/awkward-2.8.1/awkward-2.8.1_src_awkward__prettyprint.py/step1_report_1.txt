  "purpose": "Re-export certain functions and classes from the awkward.prettyprint module, possibly to maintain backward compatibility or provide a simplified interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement from awkward.prettyprint",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports and re-exports symbols",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to module import and export; no untrusted data handling or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward re-export of symbols from another module. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or file operations. It does not contain any code that could be used maliciously. The license comment references an open-source license and does not impact code security. The import statements are static and only involve standard Python import mechanics. No suspicious or unusual patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign re-export module with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply makes certain functions and classes available for import.",
