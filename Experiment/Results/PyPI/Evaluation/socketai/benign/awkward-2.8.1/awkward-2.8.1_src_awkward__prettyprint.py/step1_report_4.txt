  "purpose": "This module re-exports specific functions and classes from the 'awkward.prettyprint' submodule, serving as a public interface or aliasing layer.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'awkward.prettyprint' (a third-party library), no external input or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only re-exports imported functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific symbols from a submodule and re-exports them via __all__. It serves as a wrapper or alias for module organization. There are no operations, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward re-export module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides access to functions from another submodule without performing any operations that could be harmful.",
