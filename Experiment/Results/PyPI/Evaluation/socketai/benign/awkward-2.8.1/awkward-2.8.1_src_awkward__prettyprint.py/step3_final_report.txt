  "purpose": "This code serves as a re-export module, importing specific classes and functions from 'awkward.prettyprint' and exposing them via '__all__' for API stability or deprecation management.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'awkward.prettyprint' and the license comment at the top.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or file I/O present; no data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import from 'awkward.prettyprint' to module namespace, then re-export via '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static re-export module with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. It contains only import statements and an '__all__' declaration, with a license comment. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static re-export module with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
