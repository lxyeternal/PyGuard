{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to serve as a wrapper or alias for importing specific functions and classes from the awkward.prettyprint module, likely for use in formatting and printing data structures.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions and classes from awkward.prettyprint",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Importing functions from a trusted library; no flow of untrusted data detected",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and primarily re-exports symbols.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a license comment, then imports future annotations, and imports specific functions/classes from awkward.prettyprint. It then defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no dynamic imports, no user input handling, no network calls, or file operations. The code functions as a simple alias or re-export module, which is common in package management to facilitate backward compatibility or deprecation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a simple re-export or alias module, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
