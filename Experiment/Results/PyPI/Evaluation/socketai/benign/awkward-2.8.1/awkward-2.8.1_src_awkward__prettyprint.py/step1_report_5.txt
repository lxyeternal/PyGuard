  "purpose": "This module re-exports specific functions and classes from the awkward.prettyprint package, possibly for easier access or deprecation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and classes from 'awkward.prettyprint'. No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or potential data leaks are present; the code only performs imports and re-exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The license comment and import structure are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from a submodule and sets the __all__ attribute for export. It also includes a license comment.
