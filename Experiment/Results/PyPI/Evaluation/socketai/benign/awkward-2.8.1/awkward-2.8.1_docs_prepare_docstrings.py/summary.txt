  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static documentation generator with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation. The subprocess call to retrieve the git hash is standard and safe. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is 0. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting the minimal and controlled subprocess usage. The reports' assessments and scores are justified and accurate."
