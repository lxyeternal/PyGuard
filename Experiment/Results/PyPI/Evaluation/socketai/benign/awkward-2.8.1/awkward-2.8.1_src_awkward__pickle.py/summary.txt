  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe plugin interface for customizing pickling behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious plugins, which is a known supply chain risk rather than a flaw in this code. Scores should reflect zero malware, no obfuscation, and a moderate security risk due to plugin trust assumptions."
