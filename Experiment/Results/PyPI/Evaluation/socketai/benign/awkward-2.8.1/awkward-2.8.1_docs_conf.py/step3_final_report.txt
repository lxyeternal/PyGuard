  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, importing modules, setting environment variables, and executing 'prepare_docstrings.py' via runpy for dynamic docstring generation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, and the local script 'prepare_docstrings.py' executed with runpy.run_path.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'prepare_docstrings.py' which could be a sink if malicious code is present within that script.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration; runpy.load executes 'prepare_docstrings.py'; static assets and external URLs are loaded for documentation build.",
  "anomalies": "Use of runpy.run_path to execute a local script during build process; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with typical imports, environment variable handling, and static asset setup. The only operation that could pose a security concern is executing 'prepare_docstrings.py' via runpy, which could be malicious if the script is compromised. External assets are loaded securely with integrity hashes, and no suspicious code or obfuscation is present. The overall structure indicates a benign setup, assuming the local script is trusted. No malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and typical for documentation configuration. The primary risk stems from executing an external script, which is common but should be verified for trustworthiness. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack is present.",
