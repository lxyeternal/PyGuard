{
  "purpose": "Provides Windows console input/output handling using low-level Windows API calls, managing buffers, streams, and encoding for console interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads from console handles, command line arguments, and system APIs; writes to console handles.",
  "sinks": "Uses Windows API functions (ReadConsoleW, WriteConsoleW) for console I/O; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input flows from console handles via ReadConsoleW to internal buffers; output flows from internal buffers via WriteConsoleW to console handles.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic; standard API usage and buffer management.",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with Windows API for console I/O, wrapping handles with streams, managing buffers, and handling encoding. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications beyond console interaction. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low-level API calls are standard for console utilities and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure is clear, and the purpose is legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console I/O utility, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and low security risk (0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
