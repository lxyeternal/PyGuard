{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for handling errors within a CLI application built with the Click library, including error formatting and display logic.",
  "sources": "Input sources are primarily exception messages and optional context objects; no external data sources or untrusted input handling are present.",
  "sinks": "Output sinks include error message formatting and display functions like echo(), which output to stderr or other files; no direct untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Exception message creation and display flows are straightforward: errors are raised, formatted, and then printed. No flow involves external untrusted data manipulation or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code uses standard exception handling and formatting. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected. The use of gettext for localization is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes tailored for CLI error handling, with custom message formatting and display. It leverages external functions like echo() and get_text_stderr() for output. There is no evidence of malicious code, hidden behaviors, or data leaks. The logic is standard for error management in CLI applications. The overall design appears secure, with no external data manipulation, injection points, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of error handling classes for a CLI application. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be well-structured, with no evidence of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
