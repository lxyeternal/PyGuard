{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and user messaging in a CLI application, specifically for the Click library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules, internal function definitions, and class initializations that set up error handling logic.",
  "sinks": "Uses of the 'echo' function and string formatting that output error messages; potential for information leakage if untrusted data is included in messages.",
  "flows": "Error classes capture messages and context, then use 'echo' or string formatting in 'show' or 'format_message' methods to display errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. Usage of standard error handling and messaging patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for handling various CLI errors and exceptions, with methods to format and display messages. No data input/output flows from untrusted sources or external data to sensitive sinks are apparent. The use of string formatting is contained within error messages, which is typical for such libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard error handling module for a CLI library (Click). It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It focuses on exception definitions and user messaging, with no evidence of security risks.",
