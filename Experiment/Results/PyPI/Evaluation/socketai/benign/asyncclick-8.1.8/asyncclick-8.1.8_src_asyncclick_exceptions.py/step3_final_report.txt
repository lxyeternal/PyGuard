  "purpose": "Defines error classes and utility functions for CLI error handling, formatting, and display.",
  "sources": "Input from parameters, context objects, environment functions, and error messages.",
  "sinks": "Error messages formatted with string interpolation and output via echo() to stderr or specified files.",
  "flows": "Error data flows from exception instantiation into formatted messages, then to output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard CLI error handling classes, utilizing common functions for message formatting and output. No external data manipulation, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The use of gettext for localization and utility functions is benign. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured error handling module for a CLI framework with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and free from supply chain threats.",
