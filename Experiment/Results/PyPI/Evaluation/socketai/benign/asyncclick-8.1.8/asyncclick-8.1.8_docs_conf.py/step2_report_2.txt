  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The code imports functions (`get_version`, `ProjectLink`) from `pallets_sphinx_themes`.\n- The `get_version` function is used to retrieve version info for the project.\n- The configuration involves static data: URLs, project metadata, theme options.\n- No user input, network activity (beyond static URLs), or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code is a typical, static configuration for Sphinx documentation.\n- No code executes untrusted data or performs harmful actions.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, malicious code, or malware.\n- The imported functions are from a known theme package, used appropriately.\n\n### Potential Issues or Concerns:\n- No issues are identified with the code itself.\n- The only dynamic element, `get_version`, is from a trusted source and used safely.\n- URLs and project info are static and point to legitimate sources.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** All assign 0, which is reasonable given the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No justification is needed for higher scores; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n- The configuration is standard, well-structured, and uses trusted modules.\n- The static URLs and functions do not pose any security risk.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration script with no security concerns. The reports are consistent with my analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no issues to report. The configuration is safe, static, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
