  "purpose": "Configuration script for setting up Sphinx documentation for the 'Click' project, defining themes, extensions, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data such as project info, URLs, theme options, and imported functions from trusted packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static assignment of configuration parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports trusted functions from 'pallets_sphinx_themes' and uses them to set project version and links. All data are static strings or URLs. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The configuration is straightforward and standard for documentation setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
