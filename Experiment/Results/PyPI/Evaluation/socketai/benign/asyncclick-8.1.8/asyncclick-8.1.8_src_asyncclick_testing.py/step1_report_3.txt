{
  "purpose": "This code provides a testing framework to invoke CLI commands in an isolated environment, capturing output and simulating user input for unit testing.",
  "sources": "Input streams (stdin), environment variables, command-line arguments, and prompts within the invoke method.",
  "sinks": "System stdout and stderr, environment variables, and command execution flow.",
  "flows": "Input is provided via streams and environment variables; data flows into the CLI invocation, which captures stdout/stderr. The code temporarily modifies sys.stdin, sys.stdout, sys.stderr, environment variables, and internal prompt functions during execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Use of global variables and stream manipulation is standard for testing frameworks. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an environment to run CLI commands for testing, capturing outputs, and simulating user input with echoing options. It manipulates environment variables and sys streams within a context manager, restoring original states afterward. The invoke method executes commands asynchronously, handles exceptions, and captures outputs securely. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The code's structure is consistent with standard testing frameworks, and no anomalies indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a well-structured testing utility designed to execute CLI commands in isolation. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code and appears safe. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
