  "purpose": "A testing utility for invoking CLI commands in an isolated environment, managing environment variables, IO streams, and working directories for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from provided input streams or strings, environment variables from the env parameter, and system IO streams (stdin, stdout, stderr).",
  "sinks": "Writes to stdout and stderr streams, modifies environment variables, and changes current working directory.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from provided streams or strings into the system, environment variables are temporarily overridden, and output is captured in in-memory streams for analysis.",
  "anomalies": "Uses global variables to override system IO streams and environment variables; manipulates system state extensively for testing, but no malicious code or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive CLI testing framework that manipulates system environment, IO streams, and working directories to simulate command execution. It captures output and manages environment variables carefully, restoring system state after execution. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or malicious routines are detected. The extensive system state manipulation is typical for testing utilities and does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. Its design is consistent with standard testing practices, and the potential for misuse depends on the commands invoked externally, not on the framework itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing utility for CLI applications, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score is justified by its controlled system manipulations within a testing context.",
