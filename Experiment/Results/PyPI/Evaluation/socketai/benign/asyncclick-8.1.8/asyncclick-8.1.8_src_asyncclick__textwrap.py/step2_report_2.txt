  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code to verify their claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a subclass `TextWrapper` extending `textwrap.TextWrapper`.\n- Overrides `_handle_long_word` to customize long word wrapping.\n- Adds `extra_indent` context manager to temporarily adjust indentation.\n- Adds `indent_only` method to apply indentation to multi-line text.\n- No external data input/output, network activity, or system modifications.\n- All methods perform string manipulations and internal state management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of Reports:\n\n**1. Purpose & Sources:**\n- All reports agree the purpose is to extend text wrapping and indentation handling.\n- The code sources are internal attributes and parameters, no external input or data.\n\n**2. Sinks & Flows:**\n- No report indicates any external data sinks like network, file I/O, or system calls.\n- Data flows are confined to string processing within methods; no untrusted data handling or leaks.\n\n**3. Anomalies & Analysis:**\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected.\n- The code performs standard string and indentation manipulations.\n- The override of `_handle_long_word` is for customization, not malicious behavior.\n- The context manager and `indent_only` are safe utilities for formatting.\n\n**4. Conclusions:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are uniformly high (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, justified since the code performs only internal string formatting.\n\n### Justification for Any Higher Scores:\n- No issues found that would warrant higher risk or malware scores.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform external calls, or contain hidden malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (correct)\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and safe for use.\n\n---\n\n### My Personal Estimate (Post-Review):\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign extension of standard text formatting utilities, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and align with the code's nature. No modifications to their scores or conclusions are necessary. The code is safe, well-understood, and free of malicious intent.",
