{
  "purpose": "Extend and customize Python's textwrap.TextWrapper class to provide additional indentation management and line handling features.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods without reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data outputs, network communications, or interactions with external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward extension of text wrapping functionality without any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a subclass of textwrap.TextWrapper, overriding a private method (_handle_long_word) to modify how long words are handled during wrapping, and adding utility methods for indentation. It also includes a context manager for temporary indentation adjustment and a method for applying indentation to multi-line text. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code strictly manages text formatting and indentation, with no external input handling, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, focusing on enhancing text formatting capabilities without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not process or leak data, nor does it perform any harmful actions.",
