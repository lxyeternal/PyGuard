  "purpose": "Extension of Python's textwrap.TextWrapper for customized indentation handling and long word processing.",
  "sources": "Internal attributes such as initial_indent, subsequent_indent, and method parameters; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs internal string processing without external data output, network activity, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Method calls manipulate internal state and process strings; no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward subclassing and utility methods for text formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code extends standard text wrapping functionality with safe, well-structured methods for indentation management. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The override of _handle_long_word is a benign customization. No malicious, maliciously obfuscated, or security-sensitive behavior is present. The code's purpose is purely formatting, with no external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
