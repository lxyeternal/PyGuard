{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass of textwrap.TextWrapper to customize text wrapping and indentation handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'text' parameter in indent_only method and class attributes such as initial_indent, subsequent_indent, and break_long_words.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data causes leaks or malicious effects, such as network transmission, file operations, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input text is split into lines, then processed with applied indentation modifications; no flow leads to data leakage or harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hidden backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The class overrides methods for customization but does not perform suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code extends textwrap.TextWrapper with additional methods for managing indentation and line handling. It uses context managers safely for temporary indentation changes. No input is directly used for dangerous operations, and the code does not invoke any system commands or external resources. The modifications are purely for formatting purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of text wrapping functionality for formatting text. There are no signs of malware or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for formatting tasks.",
