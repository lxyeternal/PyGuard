  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It defines a subclass `TextWrapper` extending `textwrap.TextWrapper`.\n- Overrides `_handle_long_word` to customize long word handling.\n- Adds a context manager `extra_indent` to temporarily increase indentation.\n- Adds a method `indent_only` to apply indentation to multi-line text.\n- No external data input/output, network activity, or system modifications.\n- The code is purely for text formatting and indentation management.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The logic appears sound and consistent with its purpose.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or harmful side effects.\n- No external input or data sinks that could be exploited.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No technical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- The only potential minor concern could be the handling of long words when `break_long_words` is False and `cur_line` is empty, but this is standard behavior for text wrapping.\n\n### Review of scores:\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the clear and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code performs only text formatting, indentation, and string manipulation without external inputs, outputs, or system calls, the security risk should remain at 0.\n- The malware score is 0, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are warranted based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign extension of the standard library for text formatting purposes. It does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security issues, nor does it contain any malicious or obfuscated constructs.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, with no security risks or malware present. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No further action needed.",
