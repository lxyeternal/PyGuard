{
  "purpose": "Enhance the standard textwrap.TextWrapper class with additional functionality for long word handling, context-based indentation, and customized line indentation.",
  "sources": "Input text to the indent_only method; internal properties self.initial_indent and self.subsequent_indent; parameters passed to methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed.",
  "flows": "Input text flows from the indent_only method through processing, with indentation properties used to modify output formatting. No external data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code appears straightforward and related to text formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of textwrap.TextWrapper, overriding _handle_long_word to control long word splitting, adding an extra_indent context manager to temporarily modify indentation, and an indent_only method to apply indentation to multiline text. All methods perform standard string and property manipulations without external data access or unsafe operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. It seems purely for formatting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of textwrap.TextWrapper focused on formatting and indentation. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and poses no threat.",
