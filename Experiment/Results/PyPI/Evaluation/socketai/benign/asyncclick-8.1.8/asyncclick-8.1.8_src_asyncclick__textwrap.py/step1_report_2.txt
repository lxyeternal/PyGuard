{
  "purpose": "This code extends the textwrap.TextWrapper class to provide additional functionality for handling long words, managing indentation with context managers, and applying indentation to multi-line text.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'text' parameter in the indent_only method, and configuration data from class attributes such as initial_indent and subsequent_indent.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily manipulates string data internally. There are no untrusted data sinks like network, file I/O, or external system calls present.",
  "flows": "Input string 'text' flows through splitlines(), then into indentation logic in indent_only(), with modifications via class attributes. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The methods implement typical string manipulation and context management without external side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of textwrap.TextWrapper with an overridden _handle_long_word method for customized word wrapping behavior. It includes a context manager to temporarily modify indentation levels and a method to apply indentation to multi-line strings. All operations are confined to string processing and internal state management. There are no external inputs, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign extension of standard text wrapping functionality with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs internal string manipulations and indentation adjustments safely.",
