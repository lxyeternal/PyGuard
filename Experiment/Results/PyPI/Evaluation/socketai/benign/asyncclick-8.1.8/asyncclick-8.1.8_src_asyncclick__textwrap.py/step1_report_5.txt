{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass of textwrap.TextWrapper to customize text wrapping and indentation behavior.",
  "sources": "None; no input or external data sources are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code operates on input parameters and internal state only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Uses standard library classes and functions in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code extends textwrap.TextWrapper with a custom implementation of _handle_long_word, an extra_indent context manager, and an indent_only method. All methods perform typical string manipulation, indentation, and context management functions. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, and no use of untrusted data. The code adheres to standard practices and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of a standard library class for text formatting purposes. It does not include any malicious or security-risk behaviors. It appears to be safe and benign.",
