  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a subclass `TextWrapper` extending `textwrap.TextWrapper`.\n- Overrides `_handle_long_word` to customize long word wrapping.\n- Adds `extra_indent` context manager to temporarily adjust indentation.\n- Adds `indent_only` method to apply indentation to multi-line text.\n- No external input/output, network, or system calls.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n- **Functionality:** The code is purely for text formatting and indentation management, with no evidence of data leaks, malicious payloads, or external interactions.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The code appears well-structured and straightforward. No logical flaws or security flaws are evident.\n- The `_handle_long_word` method correctly handles long words based on `break_long_words`.\n- The `extra_indent` context manager safely manages temporary indentation changes.\n- The `indent_only` method simply prepends indentation to each line.\n\n### Review of the Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, they are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the code does not perform any operations that could pose a security threat.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted; the code is standard string manipulation.\n- No external data is processed in a risky way.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks.\n\n### Consistency of the Reports:\n- All reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The analysis aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a safe, benign extension of Python's standard library for text formatting.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is well-structured, safe, and performs only formatting tasks. No malicious or security issues are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
