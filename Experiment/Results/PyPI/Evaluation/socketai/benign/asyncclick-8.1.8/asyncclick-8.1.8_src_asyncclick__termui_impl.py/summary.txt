  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility module with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to subprocess usage, which is standard but should be used cautiously. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
