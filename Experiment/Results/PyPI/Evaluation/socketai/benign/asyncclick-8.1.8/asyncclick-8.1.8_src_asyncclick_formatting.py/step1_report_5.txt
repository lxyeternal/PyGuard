{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for text wrapping, formatting help pages, and processing options, likely used in command-line interface help systems.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read within the code. The code imports modules and functions, but does not perform data input operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or security effects are present. The code primarily manipulates strings and formatting for display purposes.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause security issues. The functions process input parameters but do not handle external untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears well-structured with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments. It uses standard text processing techniques and safe string manipulations. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides formatting utilities with functions for measuring, wrapping, and displaying text, as well as classes for formatting help pages in a command-line environment. It uses safe string operations, no external data input, and no network or system modifications. The import statements and function parameters are standard. The code does not execute untrusted code, read from external sources, or handle sensitive data insecurely. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe utility functions and classes for formatting help text and options in CLI applications. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and secure.",
