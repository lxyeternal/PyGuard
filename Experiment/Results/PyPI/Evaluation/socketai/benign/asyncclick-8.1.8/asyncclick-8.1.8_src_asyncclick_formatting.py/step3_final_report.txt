  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting help messages, wrapping text, measuring table widths, and generating CLI help output.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided to functions, terminal size detection via shutil.get_terminal_size(), internal string buffers.",
  "sinks": "Internal buffers for help text, no external data or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into formatting functions and buffers; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Uses standard modules and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of formatting utilities for CLI help messages, including text wrapping, table measurement, and help output formatting. It relies on standard modules, handles data safely, and does not process untrusted external input or perform network/system modifications. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.95).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for CLI help formatting. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score (~0.1) is justified by its reliance on terminal size detection, which is safe and common. Overall, it is a safe, straightforward utility with no malicious intent.",
