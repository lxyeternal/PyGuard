{
  "purpose": "The code provides text wrapping, formatting, and help message generation utilities, primarily for command-line interfaces.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, accesses terminal size via shutil.get_terminal_size(), and uses parameters for wrapping text.",
  "sinks": "Uses wrap_text, write, and write_* methods to output formatted text; does not process untrusted input directly into dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Input data (text, args, options) flows into wrap_text and write methods, which format and store the output; no untrusted data flows into system or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no unusual code patterns or obfuscation, no network activity or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for text measurement and wrapping, and a HelpFormatter class for generating formatted help messages with indentation and paragraph handling. The functions operate solely on provided data and do not execute or evaluate untrusted input as code. No external or hidden system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All input handling appears safe, and the code follows standard patterns for formatting and output.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving solely as a utility for text formatting and help message construction. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain attacks within this module.",
