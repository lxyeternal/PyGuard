  "purpose": "Implementation of a BitMap data structure for managing bits efficiently.",
  "sources": "None; the code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or output sensitive information.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; methods manipulate internal state only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Uses standard Python features and libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a BitMap class with methods to set, reset, flip, test, count bits, and convert between different representations. It employs standard array and bitwise operations without dynamic code execution or external data handling. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No signs of malware or malicious behavior. The class functions as a typical data structure implementation with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a BitMap data structure with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malicious or suspicious features, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
