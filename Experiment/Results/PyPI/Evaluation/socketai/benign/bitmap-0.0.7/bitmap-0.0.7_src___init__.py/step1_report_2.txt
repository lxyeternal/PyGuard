  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this line",
  "flows": "No data flows as this is only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed in an import statement",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of the BitMap class from a module named bitmap within the same package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. Since this is only an import statement, it does not provide any input/output or data flow that could be exploited. The code alone does not contain malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a standard Python import syntax.",
