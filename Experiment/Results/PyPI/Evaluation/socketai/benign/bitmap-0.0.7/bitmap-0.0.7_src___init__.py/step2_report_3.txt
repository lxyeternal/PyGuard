  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports analyze the same code snippet:\n```python\nfrom .bitmap import BitMap\n```\nThis is a straightforward import statement importing the `BitMap` class from a local module named `bitmap`. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution involved.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**  \n- The reports uniformly conclude that this code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- No external inputs, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- The code does not perform any actions beyond importing a class, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n- The reports do not identify any errors or flaws. Given the simplicity of the code, this is expected.\n- The import statement appears correct, assuming the module `bitmap.py` exists in the same package and contains the `BitMap` class.\n\n4. **Score Justifications**  \n- All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The `confidence` score is 1 across all reports, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**  \n- Since the reports are only about a single import statement, there are no assumptions about behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The code snippet is standard, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at 0, given the benign nature.\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in scoring or reasoning.\n- The code is safe and standard.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code snippet.",
