{
  "purpose": "Import the BitMap class from a local bitmap module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output data, so no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing BitMap from a local module. It does not execute any logic, handle data, or perform actions beyond importing. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
