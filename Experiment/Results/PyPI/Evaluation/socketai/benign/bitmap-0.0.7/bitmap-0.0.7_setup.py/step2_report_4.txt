  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review for Potential Issues:**\n\n- The provided `setup.py` appears standard for a Python package, with no obvious malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n- The code reads `README.md` directly for `long_description`, which could cause issues if the file is missing or malformed, but this is a common practice.\n- The package is specified with `package_dir={'bitmap': 'src'}` and `packages=['bitmap']`, which suggests the source code should be in `src/`. If the actual source code isn't in `src/`, this could cause build issues, but it doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n- The code specifies dependencies (`future`) and classifiers, which seem appropriate.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n\n- All reports have \"Empty response\" errors, indicating no detailed analysis or findings are provided.\n- Without specific reports, we cannot identify particular vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws.\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Scores:**\n\n- Since no detailed reports are available, I cannot confirm any malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The code itself does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- The only concern might be the missing `README.md` file, which could cause build failures, but this is not security-related.\n\n4. **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to potential build issues if files are missing, but nothing security-critical.\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The reports lack details; if actual malicious code or vulnerabilities exist, they are not described here.\n- The provided code appears clean and standard for a Python package setup.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware Score     | 0.0             |\n| Obfuscated Score  | 0.0             |\n| Risk Score        | 0.1             |\n\nPlease provide more detailed reports if available for a more thorough analysis.",
