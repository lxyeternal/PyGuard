  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used for packaging the 'bitmap' Python project, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; imports setup functions; defines package directory and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or system calls; standard package setup process.",
  "flows": "Source: reading 'README.md'; sink: package installation process; flow: data from file to package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward; no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or insecure elements. All reports are empty, providing no evidence of security issues. The code reads a README file, sets package info, and dependencies, which is standard. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The lack of detailed reports prevents identifying any specific vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal or zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The empty incident reports do not contain any information to suggest otherwise. Therefore, the overall security risk and malware likelihood are negligible, and scores should reflect this.",
