  "review": "Let's proceed carefully, given that all reports contain only \"Empty response\" entries, indicating no detailed analysis or claims have been provided. Here's a step-by-step review:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Malware:**\n   - The provided code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated scripts, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The code reads a README file and sets up package metadata, which is typical.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The code appears correct for its purpose.\n   - One minor issue: the `package_dir` argument should be `package_dir={'': 'src'}` if the source code is in the `src` directory, but as written, `'bitmap': 'src'` is acceptable if the package is named `bitmap` and source code is in `src/bitmap`.\n   - The `long_description` reads from `'README.md'`, which assumes the file exists; if missing, it would raise an error, but this is a common practice.\n\n3. **Score Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0.0, since there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0, no obfuscation present.\n   - **Risk score:** 0.0, as the code is standard and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious content.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities:**\n   - No claims are made; the code is straightforward.\n   - No assumptions are present to challenge.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Given the lack of issues, the scores should all be minimal or zero.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- All reports are empty, so no additional issues are identified.\n- The scores should reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis is consistent with the code provided and the absence of any claims or evidence of issues.",
