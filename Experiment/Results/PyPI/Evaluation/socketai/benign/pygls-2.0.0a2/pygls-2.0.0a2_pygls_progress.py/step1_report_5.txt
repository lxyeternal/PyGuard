{
  "purpose": "The code manages client progress notifications for a language server protocol, allowing creation, reporting, beginning, and ending of progress updates.",
  "sources": "Reads input data through function parameters such as tokens and progress values, and via the lsp.send_request and lsp.notify methods which send data to the client.",
  "sinks": "Uses lsp.send_request and lsp.notify to send progress-related data to the client, which could potentially leak progress details if misused.",
  "flows": "Tokens are registered internally; create methods send requests to initiate progress, which then lead to progress updates via begin, report, and end methods; data flows from internal function calls to lsp methods that communicate with the client.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. The code adheres to standard asynchronous request handling. No code injection or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to handling progress updates in a language server environment. It registers tokens, manages progress lifecycle, and communicates with the client via standard protocol methods. There are no indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized actions. Usage of Futures and async methods appears appropriate. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious data flows are present. The code relies on external libraries (lsprotocol, pygls), which are standard for language server implementations. No anomalies or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation for managing progress notifications in a language server. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on the provided code fragment.",
