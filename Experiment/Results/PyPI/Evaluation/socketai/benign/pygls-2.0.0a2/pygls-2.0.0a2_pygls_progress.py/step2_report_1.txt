  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, the descriptions, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a `Progress` class managing progress indicators via the Language Server Protocol (LSP). It creates, reports, and ends progress notifications.\n- It uses standard methods (`send_request`, `send_request_async`, `notify`) of an `lsp` object, which are typical for LSP implementations.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code handles tokens and progress updates in a straightforward manner.\n- Callbacks are used in `create`, which is standard but can execute external code; however, this is normal for callback-based APIs.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-Issue Review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard progress management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, as no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no anomalies or malicious signals.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, but given the benign nature, perhaps a small overestimation.\n- **Comments:** No suspicious activity; the slight security risk might be due to network communication, but this is normal.\n\n**Verdict:** The malware score of 0 is correct. The security risk of 0.2 might be slightly high; perhaps 0.1 is more appropriate, but it's not unreasonable. No major change.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** No anomalies, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, which is low.\n- **Comments:** The only potential concern is the execution of external callbacks, but this is typical and not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, which is consistent.\n- **Comments:** No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to network communication and callback execution, but within normal bounds for such a component.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' scores are consistent with the code's analysis. No significant security concerns or malicious indicators are present. The only minor point is the security risk score in some reports being slightly higher than necessary, but it's acceptable.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, standard implementation with negligible security risk.",
