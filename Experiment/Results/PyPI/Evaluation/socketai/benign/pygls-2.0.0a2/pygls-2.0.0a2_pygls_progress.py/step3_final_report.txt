  "purpose": "Manage and report progress updates within a language server protocol implementation, facilitating client-side progress indicators.",
  "sources": "Input tokens for progress creation, progress update values, and progress end signals.",
  "sinks": "Notify method calls that send progress updates to the client, potentially exposing progress data.",
  "flows": "Tokens are registered, then used in notify calls to send progress begin, report, and end messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; standard async handling and callback usage; exception on duplicate token registration is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of progress management in a language server context. It registers tokens, creates progress indicators, and sends progress updates via standard protocol methods. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The exception handling is appropriate, and callback execution is typical for such APIs. The code does not perform any network exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious activities. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The code is clear and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard progress management class for a language server protocol, with no malicious or security concerns detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
