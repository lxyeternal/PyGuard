  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code manages progress indicators via the Language Server Protocol, with standard methods for creating, reporting, and ending progress.\n- The code interacts with the `lsp` object, calling `send_request`, `send_request_async`, and `notify`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code uses standard async patterns and exception handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or secret leaks are evident.\n- The only minor point is the exception raised if a token is already registered, which is standard error handling.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis—no malicious behavior detected.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), indicating the reviewers' certainty in their benign assessment.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The second report assigns a security risk of 0.2, slightly higher than others, but still very low. This could be justified if considering the network communication involved, but no actual malicious activity is indicated.\n- The reports mention that callbacks could execute untrusted code, but this is standard in such designs and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic.\n- The use of futures and async calls is standard.\n- The exception handling for duplicate tokens is appropriate.\n- No evidence suggests the code is obfuscated or malicious.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Category        | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0.0   |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.0   |\n| Risk            | 0.1   |\n\n- The malware score remains 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score remains 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk is minimal, given the network interactions are standard protocol messages, and no malicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard implementation for progress reporting in a language server, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Confirmed: No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Scores: Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1.\n- The code appears secure and benign, functioning as intended within a language server context.",
