{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and error handling mechanisms for JSON-RPC and LSP protocols.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from error objects, exception info, or method names, especially in methods like from_error, of, and __repr__.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raising exceptions, creating ResponseError objects, or formatting error messages for output.",
  "flows": "Error objects or exception info flow from sources (e.g., error parameters or exception tuples) into exception class methods, which generate error responses or messages.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Usage of traceback for exception formatting is standard for debugging. No hidden backdoors, network activity, or data leaks detected. The code primarily defines error classes and related methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for JSON-RPC and LSP error handling, with methods for creating exceptions from error data or exception info. The code appears to be a typical error handling framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of traceback formatting is standard for debugging purposes. No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or hidden data leaks, are present. Overall, this module provides structured exception handling without any indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling implementation for JSON-RPC and LSP protocols. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It functions as a utility for structured error management in a larger application.",
