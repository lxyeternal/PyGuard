{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a JSON-RPC protocol implementation, along with error handling utilities and some registration error classes for a language server protocol (LSP) library.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported modules (`traceback`, `typing`, and `lsprotocol.types`) and from the parameters passed into class constructors and methods, such as error objects and exception info.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the creation of exception objects, potentially including traceback data and error codes. The `of` methods generate exceptions from error data and traceback info, which could be risky if error data is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted error objects or exception info are passed into static methods (`from_error`, `of`) to create exception instances, potentially propagating malicious error data. Traceback info is formatted into strings, which generally do not pose security risks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code is structured as a typical exception hierarchy, with some utility methods to generate exceptions from error objects.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes various custom exception classes for JSON-RPC error handling, including internal errors, invalid params, and server errors. The `from_error` static method can convert error objects into exceptions, matching error codes to exception classes. The `of` method in `JsonRpcInternalError` captures traceback info, which is standard practice for debugging. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The exception handling is standard and does not perform any unsafe operations beyond formatting tracebacks.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard implementation of JSON-RPC exception handling and error representation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appropriately manages error data and traceback formatting without any suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
