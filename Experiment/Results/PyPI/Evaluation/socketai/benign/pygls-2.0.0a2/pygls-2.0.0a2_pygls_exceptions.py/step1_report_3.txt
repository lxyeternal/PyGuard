{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes and error handling for JSON RPC and LSP protocols used in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class constructors and methods; static and class methods; error range validation functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; exception handling appears to process internal error data, mainly traceback information.",
  "flows": "Errors and exceptions are raised and propagated within the application; no untrusted data flows explicitly from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive exception class definitions and error handling logic; no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines structured exception classes for JSON RPC and LSP error handling, including support methods and error range validation. It uses standard Python traceback formatting for internal error reporting but does not handle or transmit untrusted external data or perform network operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns, code injections, or obfuscated behaviors are observed. The use of traceback formatting in exceptions is standard for debugging purposes, and no signs of data exfiltration or malicious backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of exception classes for RPC error handling with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be well-structured error management code for a Python-based language server or RPC framework.",
