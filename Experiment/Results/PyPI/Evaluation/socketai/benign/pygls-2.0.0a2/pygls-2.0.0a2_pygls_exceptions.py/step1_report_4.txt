{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for JSON-RPC handling and related error management in an LSP (Language Server Protocol) context.",
  "sources": "Input data from error objects, exception information, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially converts exceptions into ResponseError objects; uses traceback formatting which could include sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Error objects are created from exceptions and error codes, and then transformed into ResponseError responses.",
  "anomalies": "Uses traceback formatting to include traceback info in exceptions, which could leak internal error details; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes for JSON-RPC error handling, with methods to generate error objects and convert exceptions into response formats. Traceback info is captured for internal errors, which could inadvertently expose internal state if not properly sanitized. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Usage of exception handling and error code validation appears standard and safe. No obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception classes and error handling utilities for JSON-RPC and LSP error management. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. Traceback exposure could be a concern if error info is sent unfiltered but is standard in debugging scenarios. Overall, the code appears safe with no signs of malware or security risks.",
