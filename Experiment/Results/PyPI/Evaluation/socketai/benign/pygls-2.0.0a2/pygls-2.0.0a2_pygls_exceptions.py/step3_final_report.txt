  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for JSON-RPC and LSP error handling, including mechanisms for converting errors and handling internal exceptions.",
  "sources": "Error objects, exception info, method parameters, traceback formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "Exception creation, ResponseError objects, error response formatting, traceback strings.",
  "flows": "Error data flows from error objects and exception info into exception constructors and response formatting functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of traceback formatting could leak internal details if exceptions are sent externally; no malicious code or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of JSON-RPC error classes with methods for converting errors and capturing tracebacks for debugging. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. Traceback info, while useful for debugging, could leak internal details if not properly sanitized before external exposure. Malware score is 0, as no malicious code or payloads are present. The risk score is low (around 0.2), considering potential internal info leakage via traceback formatting. Confidence is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured error handling for JSON-RPC and LSP protocols. The main security consideration is the potential leakage of internal traceback details if exceptions are exposed externally. Overall, the code does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage, and the scores are appropriate with a minor adjustment for traceback info exposure.",
