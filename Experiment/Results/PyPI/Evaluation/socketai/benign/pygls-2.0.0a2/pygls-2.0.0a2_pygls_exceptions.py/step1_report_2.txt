{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a JSON-RPC implementation, including error handling and registration error types, mainly for use within a language server protocol (LSP) or similar framework.",
  "sources": "Imports traceback, typing (Set, Type), and a specific ResponseError class; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes and methods that generate error responses or handle exceptions; no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Errors raised during exception handling and method registration; no indication of untrusted data flow or malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code strictly focuses on error handling classes and methods, with no apparent malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to handle various JSON-RPC errors, including server errors, parsing errors, method not found, invalid parameters, and internal errors. It includes helper methods to generate error instances and support code-based identification. No external input reading, network communication, or data exfiltration is present. The exception classes are straightforward, and the code adheres to standard practices for error handling. No signs of malware, backdoors, data leakage, or malicious behavior are found. The code appears well-structured and intended solely for error management in a JSON-RPC context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of error handling classes for a JSON-RPC framework, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as expected for error classification and reporting without performing any malicious actions. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with standard practices.",
