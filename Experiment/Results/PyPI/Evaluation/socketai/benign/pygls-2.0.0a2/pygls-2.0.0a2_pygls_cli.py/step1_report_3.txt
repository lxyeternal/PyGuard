  "purpose": "A simple CLI wrapper for starting a pygls server with options for TCP, WebSocket, or IO transport.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to server.start_tcp, server.start_ws, and server.start_io with potentially untrusted input from command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from the command line determine which server start method is invoked and with which host and port values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No suspicious external connections or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI interface for starting a server with configurable network transport options. It uses argparse to process command-line parameters and then calls the appropriate server method. The arguments for host and port are passed directly from user input to server start methods, but these are standard parameters for network services and do not inherently pose a security risk. No external data sources, code injection, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI wrapper for starting a pygls server with configurable transport protocols. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the code provided.",
