  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for starting a pygls server with options for TCP, WebSocket, or IO transports, parsing command-line arguments to invoke server start methods.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--tcp, --ws, --host, --port) input via argparse",
  "sinks": "server.start_tcp, server.start_ws, server.start_io methods receiving host and port parameters",
  "flows": "Arguments parsed from CLI are passed directly to server start methods without validation or sanitization",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious imports; direct passing of user input to network functions without validation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that parses user input and calls server start methods with provided host and port. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The main concern is that user input is passed directly to network functions, which could be risky if those functions are insecure, but this is outside the scope of this code. The code's simplicity and external server method assumptions justify low malware and obfuscation scores, with a very low security risk score due to minimal exposure. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility for starting a server with configurable network options. It does not contain malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
