  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for starting a pygls server with options for TCP, WebSocket, or IO transport.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments provided by argparse.parse_args (args parameter or sys.argv if args is None).",
  "sinks": "server.start_tcp, server.start_ws, server.start_io methods, which initiate network server processes based on input.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (tcp, ws, host, port) are parsed and used to invoke server start methods that open network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code straightforwardly processes input parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a helper function for server startup, and parses command-line arguments to determine how to start the server. It uses standard libraries and a third-party server class without manipulating data in insecure or suspicious ways. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The network start methods depend on parameters but are implemented in a typical manner for such CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper for starting a pygls server with configurable transport options. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this code segment.",
