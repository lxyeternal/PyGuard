  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper for starting pygls servers with support for TCP, WebSocket, and IO transports.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "The server.start_tcp, server.start_ws, and server.start_io methods which initiate network services based on parsed arguments.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed from the command line, and depending on flags, they invoke server start methods with specified host and port.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a function to parse command-line arguments for starting a pygls server over different transports. It passes user input directly to server start methods without additional processing. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior identified. The code acts as a simple CLI front-end to server startup commands, with no network leaks, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI wrapper for starting pygls servers over different transports. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected. It performs straightforward argument parsing and server initiation.",
