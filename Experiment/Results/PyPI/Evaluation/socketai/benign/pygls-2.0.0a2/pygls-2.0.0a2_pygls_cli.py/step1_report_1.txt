  "purpose": "A CLI wrapper to start a pygls server with options for TCP, WebSocket, or IO transport",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse, including --tcp, --ws, --host, --port",
  "sinks": "Server start methods (start_tcp, start_ws, start_io) called with user-provided host and port values",
  "flows": "Parsed command-line args are used directly in server start methods without sanitization, passing user input to network binding functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or functions; code structure is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI interface for starting a server with user-specified network parameters. It accepts user input via command-line flags and passes them directly to server methods. The parameters for host and port are set via defaults or user input; no validation beyond argparse's type enforcement is performed. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The server methods are external and assumed to be safe, with no indication of malicious activity. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs indicate normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for starting a pygls server with configurable transport and network settings. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in the code itself.",
