{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define constants and parameters for a larger application, likely related to command execution or feature registration.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, database, or network interaction points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only constant string definitions with no dynamic or suspicious elements. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "This code segment is purely declarative, defining string constants that likely serve as attribute keys or parameter names in a larger system. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears standard and benign, serving as part of a configuration or attribute naming scheme.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators.",
