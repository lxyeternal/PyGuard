  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code consists solely of static string constants and comments.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, data flows, input/output handling, or executable logic.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign and declarative.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified based on the clear, straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, no justification is needed for higher scores.\n   - The code is non-executable, with no external interactions or data handling, indicating no security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior or indicators are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - The mention of 'PARAM_LS' potentially indicating 'list' or 'directory listing' is benign and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - The assessments align with the code's simplicity and lack of dynamic or external elements.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is entirely benign, serving as a set of constant definitions likely used elsewhere in a larger system. There are no security concerns or malicious indicators.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe provided code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
