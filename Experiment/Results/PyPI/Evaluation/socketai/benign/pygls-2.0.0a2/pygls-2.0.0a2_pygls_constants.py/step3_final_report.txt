  "purpose": "Define static attribute names and parameters for use in larger system components.",
  "sources": "Static string constants representing attribute names and a parameter.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining attribute keys and a parameter. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are present. The 'PARAM_LS' variable likely serves as a command or parameter identifier but is benign in isolation. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is a configuration fragment used elsewhere. No security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
