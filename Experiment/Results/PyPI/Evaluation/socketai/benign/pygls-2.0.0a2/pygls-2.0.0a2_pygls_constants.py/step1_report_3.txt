{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define some constants and parameters, possibly for use in a larger application, related to command execution and feature registration.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading operations are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data output points, especially no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this snippet only sets string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code consists solely of constant assignments and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to defining string constants and a comment header with licensing information. No runtime behavior, data input, output, or processing logic is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are detectable. The absence of dynamic code execution, data handling, or external interactions indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign snippet that defines constants for use in a larger system. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present within this fragment.",
