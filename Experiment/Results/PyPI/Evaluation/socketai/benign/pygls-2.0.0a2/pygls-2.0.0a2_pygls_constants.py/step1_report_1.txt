{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define constants and parameters related to some form of command or feature execution, likely within a larger application or system.",
  "sources": "There are no input or data sources in this snippet; it only defines static string constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling, output, or external interactions are observed.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only establishes constants and parameter names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several string constants representing attribute names and a parameter, possibly used elsewhere in the application. There are no dynamic executions, user inputs, or external data handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It seems to be part of a configuration or attribute setup for a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is benign, consisting solely of static constant definitions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. No further analysis is necessary beyond confirming its innocuous nature.",
