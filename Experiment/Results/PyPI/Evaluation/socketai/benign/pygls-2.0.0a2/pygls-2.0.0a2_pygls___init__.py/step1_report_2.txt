  "purpose": "Determine the environment and platform specifics for conditional behavior or environment setup.",
  "sources": "os.name, sys.modules, sys.platform",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code only reads environment and platform info.",
  "flows": "Reads from environment variables and system modules to set flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward environment detection.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and sys modules, then defines boolean variables to detect the operating system (Windows), presence of 'pyodide' in sys.modules, and the platform being 'wasi' or 'wasm'. These variables could be used later for environment-specific logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The variable 'pygls' is assigned a string but is unused in this snippet; it may be intended for later use.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform environment detection without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard setup for platform-specific logic and does not contain malware or security risks.",
