  "purpose": "Detect operating environment characteristics such as OS, platform, and runtime environment.",
  "sources": "os.name, sys.modules, sys.platform",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no data outputs or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; environment checks are read-only operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment detection variables is standard; no suspicious code behavior or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and sys modules to determine the environment (Windows, Pyodide, WASI, WASM). It assigns boolean flags based on platform or environment conditions. There are no data leaks, network activity, or malicious code segments. The variables are typical for environment detection and do not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment detection snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
