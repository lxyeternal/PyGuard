  "purpose": "Determine the environment and platform specifics for the application, likely for configuring behavior based on OS or runtime.",
  "sources": "Imports from os and sys modules; reads from os.name, sys.modules, and sys.platform.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is written or transmitted, nor are external calls or sensitive data accessed.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables and modules; flow: environment checks without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; straightforward environment detection logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection by checking the OS (os.name), runtime modules (sys.modules), and platform (sys.platform). The variables IS_WIN, IS_PYODIDE, IS_WASI, and IS_WASM are boolean flags set based on these environment checks. There is no dynamic code execution, no data collection, nor any suspicious behavior. The only data read is from standard environment attributes, which are safe and typical for environment configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment detection snippet with no malicious intent or security risks.",
