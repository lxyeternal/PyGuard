  "purpose": "Determine the environment and platform characteristics such as Windows, Pyodide, WASI, or WASM.",
  "sources": "os.name, sys.modules, sys.platform",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only reads environment information.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system module data to internal flags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The variable 'pygls' is defined but not used; it may be unused or a remnant, but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules os and sys, then sets boolean flags based on environment detection (Windows, Pyodide, WASI, WASM). The variables are used for environment detection purposes only. The variable 'pygls' is assigned a string but not used, which could be a placeholder or configuration, but there is no malicious behavior. No input, network access, or sensitive data handling is present. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply detects environment characteristics and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard environment detection code with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
