  "purpose": "Environment detection using standard system attributes to identify platform specifics.",
  "sources": "Reading os.name, sys.modules, and sys.platform to determine environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Input sources (os.name, sys.modules, sys.platform) are used to set boolean flags; no data flows to external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'pygls' is assigned a string but remains unused; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward environment detection by importing standard modules and setting flags based on system attributes. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The unused variable 'pygls' is benign. The code is simple, safe, and aligns with typical environment checks. No external calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are evident. The license comment block contains a minor formatting error but no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign environment detection logic with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals, scores, and observations confirm its safety. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.",
