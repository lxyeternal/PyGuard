  "purpose": "Detect the operating environment and platform details to adapt behavior accordingly.",
  "sources": "os.name, sys.modules, sys.platform",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data outputs or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only sets environment flags based on system properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward environment detection with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'os' and 'sys' modules, then defines flags to determine if the environment is Windows, Pyodide, WASI, or WebAssembly. It checks 'os.name' for Windows, presence of 'pyodide' in 'sys.modules' for Pyodide, and 'sys.platform' for WASI. The variable 'pygls' is assigned a string but not used, indicating possible future use or placeholder. There are no code injection, data leaks, or malicious patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs benign environment detection to configure application behavior based on platform specifics. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
