{
  "purpose": "The code constructs server capabilities based on client capabilities and feature flags, configuring various language server features accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads client capabilities, feature flags, and feature options to determine configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "Assigns configuration objects and capabilities to the server capabilities data structure; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and internal checks into configuration attributes of the server capabilities object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard builder pattern for setting up server capabilities based on client capabilities and feature flags. It performs attribute access and configuration assignments without executing untrusted code or external data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is straightforward, well-structured, and relies solely on safe data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe configuration builder for language server capabilities. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score is appropriate, and malware and obfuscated scores should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
