{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python wrapper around a C library to manage batches of sequences, likely for cryptographic or data processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads sequence attributes: sequence.id, sequence.name, sequence.data",
  "sinks": "Calls to C functions lib.dcp_batch_add, lib.dcp_batch_reset, lib.dcp_batch_del, and access to _cbatch pointer",
  "flows": "Sequence attributes are encoded and passed to the C library functions for adding data to a batch, with resource cleanup in __del__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No external data sources or network activity. Usage of standard CFFI interface.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a batch object by calling a C function, managing resources carefully. It encodes sequence attributes before passing to the C library. No external inputs beyond sequence object attributes are processed. The deletion method safely releases resources. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected. The functions appear to interface with a native library to manage data batches.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around a native C library for batch management. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the security of the underlying C library.",
