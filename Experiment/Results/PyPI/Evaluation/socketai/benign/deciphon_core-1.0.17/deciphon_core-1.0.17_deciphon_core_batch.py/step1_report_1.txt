{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Batch class that manages a batch of Sequence objects for processing with the deciphon_core C library, enabling addition, reset, and cleanup of sequences.",
  "sources": "Sequence object attributes: sequence.id, sequence.name, sequence.data",
  "sinks": "lib.dcp_batch_add function call, passing sequence data to underlying C library",
  "flows": "Sequence attributes (id, name, data) -> lib.dcp_batch_add() via add() method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The use of CFFI to interface with a C library is standard practice in Python extensions. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a batch object via a C library function, adds sequence data to the batch, and handles cleanup. The add() method encodes sequence attributes and passes them to the C function. Error handling is performed via exceptions. No indication of malicious data handling or malicious code execution pathways. No suspicious data leaks or external communications are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper around a C library for batch processing of sequences. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns. It functions as intended for managing data with the underlying library.",
