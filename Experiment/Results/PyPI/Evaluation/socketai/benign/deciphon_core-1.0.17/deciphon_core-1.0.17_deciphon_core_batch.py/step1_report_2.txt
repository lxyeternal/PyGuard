{
  "purpose": "Defines a Batch class to manage and add Sequence objects into a native C library batch structure.",
  "sources": "Reads Sequence.id, Sequence.name, and Sequence.data; calls lib.dcp_batch_add and other lib functions.",
  "sinks": "lib.dcp_batch_add, lib.dcp_batch_new, lib.dcp_batch_reset, lib.dcp_batch_del (interacting with C library).",
  "flows": "Sequence.id, name, data -> lib.dcp_batch_add via batch methods; batch object lifecycle manages native resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Uses standard CFFI calls; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a wrapper around C library functions to manage batch processing of sequences. It safely allocates and releases native resources, with proper error handling via DeciphonError. No untrusted input appears to be directly manipulated in unsafe ways. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The use of CFFI and interaction with the library seems standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured wrapper for native library calls with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
