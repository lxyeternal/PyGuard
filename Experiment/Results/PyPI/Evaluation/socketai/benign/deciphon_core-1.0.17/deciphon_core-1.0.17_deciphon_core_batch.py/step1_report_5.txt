  "purpose": "Define a Batch class for managing sequences and interfacing with a C library for batch processing.",
  "sources": "Reads sequence.id, sequence.name, and sequence.data from Sequence objects.",
  "sinks": "Calls to external C functions (lib.dcp_batch_add, lib.dcp_batch_reset, lib.dcp_batch_del) with internal data.",
  "flows": "Sequence attributes (id, name, data) flow into lib.dcp_batch_add via the internal _cbatch object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with an external C library to manage batch data. It initializes a batch, adds sequences by encoding their attributes, and resets or deletes the batch as needed. No suspicious code patterns, such as network activity, file manipulation, or credential handling, are present. Usage of external C functions is common in performance-critical modules. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward interface for batch processing using a C library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It manages resources properly and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
