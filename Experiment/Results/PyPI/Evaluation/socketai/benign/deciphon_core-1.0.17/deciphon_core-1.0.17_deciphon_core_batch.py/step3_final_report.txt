  "purpose": "Provides a Python wrapper for managing sequence batches via a C library, handling resource management and data encoding.",
  "sources": "Sequence attributes (id, name, data) read from Sequence objects, passed to C functions.",
  "sinks": "C library functions that manage batch data; no untrusted data flows into external systems.",
  "flows": "Sequence data flows from Sequence object attributes into C functions through encoding, with no external network or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured wrapper around a C library for batch processing sequences. It manages resources properly, encodes sequence attributes before passing to C functions, and handles errors appropriately. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the trustworthiness of the underlying C library. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wrapper around a native C library with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, contingent on the security of the external library. The current scores are justified and appropriate.",
