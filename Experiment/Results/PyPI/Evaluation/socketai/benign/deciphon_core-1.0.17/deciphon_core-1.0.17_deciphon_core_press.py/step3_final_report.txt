  "purpose": "A Python wrapper managing resources and interfacing with a C library for biological data processing involving HMM and Gencode objects.",
  "sources": "File paths from self._hmm.path and self._hmm.dbpath.path passed to C functions",
  "sinks": "External C library functions that process file paths and return error codes",
  "flows": "File path data flows from object attributes to C functions, with error handling via exceptions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward resource management wrapper around external C functions, with proper error handling and cleanup. It does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The data flow involves passing controlled file paths to C functions, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The external library's safety is assumed but not verified; however, the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured wrapper around trusted external C functions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score and zero malware score are justified, and the code can be considered safe.",
