{
  "purpose": "The code imports the '_cffi_backend' module, likely to ensure that the CFFI backend is included for packaging or runtime purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '_cffi_backend' module during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present in this code.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement, which is a static import; no data flow or external data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "The import is a common practice to include the CFFI backend, especially when using tools like PyInstaller. No suspicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. The comment indicates it's a workaround or requirement for packaging but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports a necessary backend module for CFFI, possibly for compatibility with frozen or packaged Python applications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The import is straightforward and documented in comments. No external inputs, environment variables, or network activity are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and intended for packaging compatibility. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided content.",
