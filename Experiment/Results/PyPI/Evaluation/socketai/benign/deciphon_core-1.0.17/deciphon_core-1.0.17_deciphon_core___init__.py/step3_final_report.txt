{
  "purpose": "The code imports the '_cffi_backend' module to ensure the CFFI backend is included during packaging or runtime, particularly for tools like PyInstaller.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which loads the '_cffi_backend' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the static import of the module, with no data or control flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with a comment indicating its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard import used to include a C extension module necessary for packaging support. No data processing, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low or zero security risk score. The slight variation in risk scores (0.1) in some reports is conservative; given the benign nature, it should be 0. The code does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, and the purpose is well-understood in the Python packaging context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores should be adjusted to reflect a risk score of 0 for consistency. No further action or concern is warranted.",
