  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `import _cffi_backend`.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: ensuring the CFFI backend is included during packaging, particularly with tools like PyInstaller.\n- No reports indicate any data processing, network activity, or external inputs.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and well-documented.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's presence and intent:\n- The code is a static import of a C extension module (`_cffi_backend`).\n- This is a common pattern in Python projects using cffi to ensure the backend module is included in frozen or packaged distributions.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident.\n\n### Error detection:\n- The code is syntactically correct and purpose-driven.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n- The reports correctly identify the purpose and benign nature.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the benign intent. A slightly higher score (0.1) in report 3 is still reasonable given the minimal potential for packaging issues, but it doesn't indicate actual risk.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- It does not process untrusted data.\n- It is a standard import statement for packaging support.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume the import is solely for packaging support, which is accurate.\n- No report suggests any vulnerability or malicious behavior based on the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — The code is benign.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is straightforward.\n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risk is present.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a minimal, benign import statement used for packaging support in Python projects relying on cffi. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
