{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import the '_cffi_backend' module, likely to ensure it is included during packaging or runtime, particularly for C Foreign Function Interface (CFFI) dependencies.",
  "sources": "The import statement for '_cffi_backend' indicates the code reads this module during execution.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as this is a straightforward import statement with no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not include any unusual or suspicious constructs. Importing '_cffi_backend' is a common practice in Python projects using CFFI and is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code's sole purpose is to import a specific backend module, likely to ensure proper inclusion in package distributions like PyInstaller. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or malicious intent. The import is standard for CFFI-based projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended to facilitate packaging or runtime dependencies for CFFI. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
