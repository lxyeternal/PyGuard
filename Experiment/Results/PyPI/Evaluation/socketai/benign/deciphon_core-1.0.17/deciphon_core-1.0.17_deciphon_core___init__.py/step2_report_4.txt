  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `import _cffi_backend`.\n- The purpose across all reports is to ensure that the CFFI backend module is included during packaging (e.g., with PyInstaller).\n- The code is minimal, static, and straightforward, with no data processing, network activity, or environment manipulation.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or signs of malicious intent are evident.\n- All scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, and security risk scores are very low or zero.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating agreement among reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The import statement is legitimate and standard in projects that rely on CFFI.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- The code's purpose is to support packaging, not to perform any harmful actions.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is benign. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports, consistent with benign intent.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n  - SecurityRisk: Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which is negligible.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The highest reported is 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The report with a securityRisk of 0.1 could be reconsidered. Since the code is purely an import for packaging support, the risk remains negligible. A 0.1 might overstate the risk unless there's context suggesting otherwise.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 (negligible, given the benign purpose)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign import statement used to ensure inclusion of a CFFI backend module during packaging.\n- No evidence supports any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, though the minimal security risk could be set to zero for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the purpose of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and typical for Python projects utilizing CFFI.",
