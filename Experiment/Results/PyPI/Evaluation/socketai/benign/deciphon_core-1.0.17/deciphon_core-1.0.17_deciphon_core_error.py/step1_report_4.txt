{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'DeciphonError' that retrieves and displays error messages from a C library function.",
  "sources": "Importing functions 'ffi' and 'lib' from 'deciphon_core._cffi', calling 'lib.dcp_error_string(errno)'",
  "sinks": "Decoding the error message obtained from the C library function 'dcp_error_string' into a Python string",
  "flows": "The error number 'errno' is passed to 'lib.dcp_error_string', whose output is converted into a string and used in an exception",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code straightforwardly wraps a C library function into a Python exception class without suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports FFI and library references from a CFFI module, defines a custom RuntimeError subclass that retrieves error descriptions from the C library, and initializes the exception with a decoded error message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code. It functions as a typical wrapper for error handling between Python and C.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for wrapping C library error messages into a Python exception class. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
