  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same core code: a simple wrapper class `DeciphonError` that converts C library error codes into Python exceptions.\n- The code uses `ffi` and `lib` imported from `deciphon_core._cffi`, calling `lib.dcp_error_string(errno)` and decoding the returned C string.\n- No untrusted input beyond an integer error code is processed.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code is standard for CFFI error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code functions as intended: wrapping C error messages into Python exceptions.\n- No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The use of `ffi.string()` and `decode()` is typical and safe in this context.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical or security flaws are apparent.\n- The only minor concern is if `lib.dcp_error_string()` returns sensitive info or if `ffi.string()` exposes unintended data, but this is standard and expected behavior in such wrappers.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malware or malicious intent is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security risk:** Scores are very low (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal risk. This seems reasonable.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- The code is a minimal, safe wrapper with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The only potential concern could be if `lib.dcp_error_string()` leaks sensitive info, but that is a design issue with the underlying C library, not the wrapper itself.\n- The assigned scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) seem appropriate.\n\n### Consistency and suggestions:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk in error handling wrappers)\n\nThe code is standard, safe, and non-malicious. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a straightforward, benign error handling wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
