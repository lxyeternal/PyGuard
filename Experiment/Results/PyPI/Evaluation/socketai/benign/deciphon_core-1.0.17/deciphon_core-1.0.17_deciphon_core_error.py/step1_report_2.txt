  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors from the deciphon_core C library.",
  "sources": "The import from deciphon_core._cffi, specifically ffi and lib, which are used to interface with the C library functions.",
  "sinks": "The code calls lib.dcp_error_string(errno), which retrieves an error message string from the C library.",
  "flows": "Error number (errno) is passed to lib.dcp_error_string to obtain an error message; this message is then decoded and passed to RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code straightforwardly wraps a C library call for error reporting with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ffi and lib from a CFFI-based module, then defines a custom RuntimeError subclass that converts an integer error code into a human-readable message by calling a C function. The call to lib.dcp_error_string is standard for error handling in C extensions, and decoding the result is typical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose: error handling for a C library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate wrapper for converting C library error codes into Python exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security issues. It is a standard pattern for CFFI error handling.",
