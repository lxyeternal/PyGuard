  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports ffi and lib from deciphon_core._cffi.\n- Defines a DeciphonError class inheriting from RuntimeError.\n- In __init__, calls lib.dcp_error_string(errno), converts the C string to a Python string, and passes it to the superclass.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code correctly calls `lib.dcp_error_string(errno)` and uses `ffi.string()` to handle the C string, then decodes it.\n- No input or untrusted data beyond the error number is processed.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- The purpose is standard error wrapping for a C library.\n\n**Conclusion:** The core logic is sound, and no issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Report 1-5 Common Points:**\n- All agree that the code is a straightforward wrapper.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The error message retrieval is standard practice.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9-1).\n\n**Differences:**\n- Slight variation in security risk scores (from 0 to 0.2), but all are low.\n- Malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The use of `ffi.string()` and `lib.dcp_error_string()` is typical for CFFI-based error handling.\n- The error message could potentially leak sensitive info if the C library's error strings are sensitive, but this is a typical risk with error messages, not specific to this code.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are reasonable given the context.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at 0; the code is straightforward.\n- The **risk score** can be kept very low, perhaps 0.1, since the only concern is potential leakage of error info, which is standard and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable given the minimal risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign error wrapper with no security issues.**",
