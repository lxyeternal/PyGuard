{
  "purpose": "This code defines an error handling class for the 'deciphon_core' CFFI interface, enabling Python to interact with underlying C functions and handle errors gracefully.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported modules 'ffi' and 'lib' from 'deciphon_core._cffi', and uses 'lib.dcp_error_string(errno)' to obtain error messages from the C library.",
  "sinks": "The error message obtained via 'ffi.string' is used as a string message in the RuntimeError, which is a safe operation. No untrusted input is directly processed or output.",
  "flows": "Error code (errno) from Python calls is passed to 'lib.dcp_error_string' to get a descriptive string, which is then decoded and used in an exception. The flow is straightforward and from C library error codes to Python exception messages.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and only wraps existing C library error reporting; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary components from a CFFI-based interface, defines a custom error class that retrieves error messages from the underlying C library using 'lib.dcp_error_string', and raises a RuntimeError with the message. The use of 'ffi.string' and 'decode' is standard practice for handling C strings. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed. The code functions solely as an error wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard error handling wrapper for a C library. It does not contain malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. It safely converts C error codes into Python exceptions.",
