{
  "purpose": "This code defines an error class for handling errors from the deciphon_core C library, wrapping C library error messages into Python exceptions.",
  "sources": "The code imports ffi and lib from deciphon_core._cffi, which are used to access C functions and strings.",
  "sinks": "The code calls lib.dcp_error_string with an error number, which could potentially be used to leak error messages if misused, but in this context it appears to be for error reporting only.",
  "flows": "Error number passed to DeciphonError is used to retrieve a string from the C library, which is then decoded into a message, then passed to RuntimeError.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, but the only potential concern is if lib.dcp_error_string returns sensitive info or if ffi.string exposes unintended data. However, this is standard FFI usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and uses FFI and C functions to generate error messages. It defines a custom error class that wraps C library errors. No input or untrusted data sources are present beyond the error number parameter, which is an integer. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated behavior. The use of ffi.string and lib functions appears typical for C extension interfacing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard error handling wrapper around a C library, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. It merely translates C library error messages into Python exceptions.",
