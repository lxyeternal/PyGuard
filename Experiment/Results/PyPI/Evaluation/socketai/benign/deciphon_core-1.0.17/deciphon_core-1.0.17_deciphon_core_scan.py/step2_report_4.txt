  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward Python wrapper around a C library for scanning, with proper resource management, exception handling, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The exception handling via `check_exception` is typical for CFFI.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that inputs flow into native functions without apparent malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — appropriate given the lack of evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No suspicious data handling or malicious behavior is apparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the standard nature of the wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is typical for native bindings, with no malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that the callback is empty, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The minimal callback might be incomplete but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing standard native library interaction with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No suspicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert channels.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward, standard pattern.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation, mostly low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's nature, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The callback function being empty in multiple reports is noted as unusual but not malicious; if this is a placeholder, it should be documented.\n- No evidence suggests supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n- The code appears legitimate, with proper resource management and error handling.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to the use of native code and callback handling, which always warrants cautious review but is standard here.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe wrapper around a native C library, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.",
