  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward Python wrapper around a C library, managing resources properly, with no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The callback is used for exception handling, which is standard. No malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Slightly elevated due to native code interaction, but no issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a wrapper around native functions, passing potentially untrusted paths into C functions. However, no malicious intent or suspicious logic is detected. The callback is a no-op.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Potential concern:** Passing untrusted data into native code could be risky if the native library is insecure, but within this code, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n  \n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard wrapper with no obfuscation or malicious logic. The callback is empty, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1—appropriate.\n- **Note:** The minimal callback might be incomplete but not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, standard native library wrapper, resource management, and no malicious behavior. The callback is minimal.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1—appropriate.\n- **Observation:** No signs of sabotage or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern: a clean interface to native code, with proper resource handling, no suspicious data flows, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2—reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to native code interaction, but no actual security issues are identified.\n- **Malware score justification:** Zero across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only concern could be passing untrusted data into native code, but this is typical for such wrappers and depends on the native library’s security, which is outside the scope of this code review.\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate, standard Python wrapper around a native C library for scanning operations.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The callback functions are minimal or placeholders, which might be incomplete but are not suspicious.\n- The resource management and error handling are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final scores (my estimate):**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to native code interaction, but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\nThese scores reflect a safe, legitimate codebase with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
