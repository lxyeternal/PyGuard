{
  "purpose": "Define a data class named 'Sequence' with three fields: id, name, and data.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations; no data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks, as the code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class definition using Python's dataclasses module. It declares a class 'Sequence' with three attributes and specifies __all__ for exports. There are no input, output, or external data interactions. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard, benign, and intended for data storage purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
