  "purpose": "Define a simple data structure for sequences with id, name, and data attributes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dataclass, defines a class Sequence with three attributes, and sets __all__. It contains no input/output, no dynamic code, no external data handling, and no malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward data class with no security issues or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
