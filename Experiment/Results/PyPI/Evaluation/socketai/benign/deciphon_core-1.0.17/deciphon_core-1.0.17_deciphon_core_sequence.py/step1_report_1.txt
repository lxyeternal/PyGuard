{
  "purpose": "Define a simple data structure 'Sequence' with three attributes: id, name, and data.",
  "sources": "Code reads class and attribute definitions, and the import statement for dataclass.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is processed or sent untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines a data class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'dataclass' from the 'dataclasses' module and defines a data class 'Sequence' with three fields. The __all__ variable restricts exports to 'Sequence'. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, no network connections, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward data structure definition intended for organizing data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a data container without any operations that could be exploited.",
