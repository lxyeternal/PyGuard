{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure for storing sequence information with an id, name, and data fields.",
  "sources": "No input sources; no reading of external data or user input present.",
  "sinks": "No output or data sinks; no data transmission, storage, or logging observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways; the code only declares a data class without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the dataclass decorator, defines a module export for 'Sequence', and declares a simple data class with three fields: id, name, and data. There are no functions, no external data handling, and no potentially malicious constructs. The structure appears to be a straightforward data container with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines a data class intended for data storage, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears benign and serves a clear, safe purpose.",
