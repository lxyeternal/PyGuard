{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple data structure 'Sequence' with three attributes: id, name, and data.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports the 'dataclass' decorator, defines a list '__all__' for exports, and declares a dataclass 'Sequence' with three fields. It does not include any input handling, external data access, or side-effect-inducing operations. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of a data structure with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain risk.",
