  "purpose": "Define a simple data structure for a sequence with id, name, and data attributes",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; class attributes are hardcoded and static",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; no runtime data processing or untrusted data flow present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs; straightforward dataclass definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports the dataclass decorator, defines an explicit __all__, and creates a simple data class with three attributes. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no side effects or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be standard, clean, and intended solely for data structuring. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of a data structure with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides a data container class with no external data handling or insecure operations.",
