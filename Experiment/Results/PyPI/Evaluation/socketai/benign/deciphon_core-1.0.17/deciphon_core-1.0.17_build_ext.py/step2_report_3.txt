  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code clones trusted repositories from GitHub, builds C libraries, and generates Python bindings via cffi.\n- All reports consistently identify that the script performs standard build procedures, with no suspicious code or malicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity beyond cloning known repositories.\n- The environment variable handling and subprocess calls are typical for build scripts.\n- The URLs used are public and reputable, reducing supply chain concerns.\n- The scores for malware are all 0, and the confidence levels are high (0.9), which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious logic.\n- No input validation issues or injection vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The cloning process and build steps are standard.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical flaws in the code.\n- The only potential concern is reliance on external repositories, but the URLs are reputable.\n- No significant mistakes or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low risk due to reliance on external repositories but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **security risk** scores could be slightly higher (e.g., 0.2) considering the external dependencies, but given the reputation of the sources, the current scores are reasonable.\n- The **malware scores** are appropriate at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate.** They correctly identify that the script is a standard build automation process with no malicious intent. The scores reflect a low security risk, which is justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to external dependencies, but no active threat)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is a typical build script for open-source dependencies with no signs of malicious behavior. The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.",
