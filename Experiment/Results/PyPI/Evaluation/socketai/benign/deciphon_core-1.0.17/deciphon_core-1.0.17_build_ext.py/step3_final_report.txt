{
  "purpose": "Automates cloning, building, and installing multiple open-source C dependencies, then generates Python bindings via cffi.",
  "sources": "Repository URLs, environment variables (e.g., C_INCLUDE_PATH, LIBRARY_PATH), subprocess calls for 'make' and 'make install', local header files (interface.h).",
  "sinks": "System calls executing build commands, environment variable modifications, filesystem operations (cloning, moving directories), cffi compilation.",
  "flows": "Repository URLs → clone repositories → build via subprocess → generate cffi bindings from local headers.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity beyond cloning from trusted repositories, no input validation issues, no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build automation for open-source C libraries with Python bindings. It clones reputable repositories, sets environment variables, executes make commands, and generates cffi bindings from local headers. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The environment variables are managed securely, and the process aligns with typical build scripts. The reliance on external repositories introduces minimal supply chain risk, but the URLs are reputable. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build automation process with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The security risk is low, and the code is clear and straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified.",
