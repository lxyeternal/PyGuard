{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'pandas_ta', primarily used for technical analysis in financial data processing.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the setup parameters such as author_email, maintainer_email, url, download_url, and the dependencies listed under install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the email addresses, URLs, and dependencies that could be exploited if manipulated or if malicious packages are included.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided setup configuration into package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted data flows into executable code or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata, are present. The code solely focuses on package setup and metadata declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script utilizing distutils for package configuration. It specifies package data, dependencies, metadata, and classifiers. All fields appear to be legitimate and typical for an open-source Python package. No code execution, input handling, or dynamic behaviors are present that could introduce malicious activity. The dependencies are common in financial data analysis contexts and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration for a publicly available Python library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code. It appears safe and intentionally designed for open-source distribution.",
