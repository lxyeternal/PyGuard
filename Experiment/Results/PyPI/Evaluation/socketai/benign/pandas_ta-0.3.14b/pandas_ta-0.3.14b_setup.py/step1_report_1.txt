{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'pandas_ta' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "User-provided static variables, setup() arguments, and imported modules (distutils.core).",
  "sinks": "Installation process via pip, dependency downloads, and metadata exposure. No direct data sinks or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Package metadata and dependencies flow into package installation and distribution mechanisms. No dynamic code execution or external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard setup tools and common package dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It imports 'distutils.core.setup' for package configuration, defines metadata, dependencies, and package data. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident. The dependencies and package data are typical for a Python data analysis package. No external data sources are accessed or manipulated dynamically, and no network communication or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily facilitates package distribution and dependency management without executing any suspicious or malicious code.",
