{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up and configuring the 'pandas_ta' Python package, which provides technical analysis indicators for financial data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, dependencies, author information, and package data configurations.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to files, executes untrusted input, or performs network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data input/output flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors identified. Usage of 'distutils.core.setup' is standard for package setup; no obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup activities: defining metadata, dependencies, package data, and classifiers. It imports only standard setup modules and specifies dependencies and package data. No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The dependencies listed are common in Python data science and finance projects, with no indication of malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward, following standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a benign configuration for distributing a financial analysis library.",
