{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package 'pandas_ta', including metadata, dependencies, and package data, to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "User inputs via setup() parameters, package data files (CSV in data/ directory), and specified dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Installation process, dependency resolution, and data file inclusion. No evident code execution or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No specific source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data are present. The code primarily configures package metadata and dependencies without processing external inputs or executing dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; the setup script is standard, listing dependencies and package data. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are observed. No code injection or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python packaging practices to define package metadata, dependencies, and package data files. It imports distutils for setup, specifies metadata such as author info, dependencies, and package data including CSV files. All code appears straightforward and conventional. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The dependencies listed are common for a data analysis/finance package. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides metadata and dependency specifications for packaging and distribution of a financial analysis library.",
