  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard Python setup script for the 'pandas_ta' package.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- Dependencies are typical for a financial data analysis library.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it's a setup.py script using `distutils.core.setup`.\n- No issues with the code's logic or structure.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.\n- No obfuscation present.\n- The dependencies are standard and appropriate.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The only possible concern is the presence of dependencies like `talib` and `ta-lib`, which are known to sometimes have platform-specific installation issues, but this does not imply malicious intent.\n- The `download_url` points to a GitHub repository, which is typical for open-source projects.\n\n### Scores:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, consistent.\n- The security risk scores are 0, which seems appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present, a malware score higher than 0 is unwarranted.\n- The risk score remains at 0, as the package setup is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.",
