{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'pandas_ta', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "User input (metadata), external dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "N/A - setup configuration, no data flow or code execution beyond package installation metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python library. It imports only 'distutils.core.setup', sets metadata fields, lists package data, and specifies dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The dependencies include common packages related to data analysis and trading, with no indication of malicious or unauthorized actions. The code appears legitimate and typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
