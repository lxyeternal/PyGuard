  "purpose": "Calculate rolling kurtosis for a pandas Series of 'close' prices with optional parameters for offset and fill methods.",
  "sources": "Input pandas Series 'close', optional parameters 'length', 'offset', 'min_periods', 'fillna', 'fill_method' from kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data processed internally; no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input Series -> verify_series -> rolling window -> kurt() -> shift (offset) -> fillna (if specified) -> output Series.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; straightforward pandas operations; helper functions assumed safe.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard statistical calculation of rolling kurtosis using pandas, with input validation and optional fill methods. It does not include external network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The logic is clear, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The helper functions are assumed safe. The code's purpose is benign, and the scoring reflects this with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a rolling kurtosis indicator with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors. The scores assigned are accurate and justified based on the code's functionality.",
