{
  "purpose": "Calculate rolling kurtosis of a financial time series (e.g., closing prices).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'close' (pd.Series), 'length' (int), 'offset' (int), and optional kwargs ('min_periods', 'fillna', 'fill_method').",
  "sinks": "Data returned as a pandas Series; no external data sinks or network communications involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' → verify_series; 'length' and 'min_periods' influence rolling calculation; 'offset' shifts the result; fillna fills missing values; output is the processed Series.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden functionalities observed. The code performs straightforward statistical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input parameters, performs a standard rolling kurtosis calculation using pandas, handles offset shifting, and fills missing data if specified. It is well-structured, uses standard pandas methods, and includes documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscation or misleading code present. It is a typical implementation of a technical indicator for financial analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a rolling kurtosis indicator with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs legitimate statistical computation and handles common data processing tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
