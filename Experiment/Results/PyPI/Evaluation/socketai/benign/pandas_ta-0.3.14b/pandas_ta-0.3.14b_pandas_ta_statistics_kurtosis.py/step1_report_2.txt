{
  "purpose": "Calculate the rolling kurtosis of a given pandas Series of closing prices as a statistical indicator.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'close' pandas Series; reads optional parameters from kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Returns a pandas Series with kurtosis values; no apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads 'close' data -> computes rolling kurtosis -> applies offset and fill options -> returns the result.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code appears standard for statistical computation. No suspicious external calls or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies and processes input parameters, applies rolling kurtosis calculation, manages offset and missing data fill options, and labels the resulting Series. It utilizes trusted pandas_ta utility functions for verification and offset calculations. There are no external network calls, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is well-structured and typical of statistical indicator implementations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a statistical indicator with no malicious intent. It securely processes data, handles optional parameters appropriately, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears safe and benign.",
