  "purpose": "Calculate the rolling kurtosis indicator for a pandas Series of closing prices.",
  "sources": "Reads input data 'close' (pandas Series), and potentially 'min_periods', 'fillna', 'fill_method' from kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Returns a pandas Series with calculated kurtosis; no sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' -> verify_series -> rolling kurtosis calculation -> optional fillna or fill_method -> return Series.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard pandas operations for statistical calculation without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard calculation of rolling kurtosis using pandas. It validates input, applies optional offset, and handles missing data with fill methods. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors observed. No code injection, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies solely on pandas functions for data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a statistical indicator without any malicious intent or security risks. It operates within normal data processing boundaries and does not contain malicious behaviors.",
