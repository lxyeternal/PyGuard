{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python framework for financial data analysis using pandas DataFrames, enabling the application of various technical analysis indicators, strategies, and data fetching utilities.",
  "sources": "Data is read from pandas DataFrames and Series via the _get_column method; external data fetching through yf() function (likely yfinance); user input via function arguments and DataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could be processed through _get_column, which retrieves DataFrame columns or Series; indicator functions may process untrusted input if user-controlled column names are used; data fetching with yf() could retrieve external data, but no external data manipulation occurs within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input sources include DataFrame columns, user-supplied parameters, and external data fetch functions (yf). Data flows from sources into indicator functions via _get_column, then results are processed with _post_process and potentially appended to the DataFrame. User inputs influence column selections and parameters but are handled via controlled methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an external yf() function for data retrieval could be suspicious, but no malicious code is shown here; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident; the code employs standard Python and pandas features; no obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden network activity are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive extension of pandas DataFrames for financial analysis, with methods to fetch data, apply indicators, and manage DataFrame state. It handles user input carefully, retrieving columns and data sources via _get_column. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are present. The external yf() function's purpose is to download financial data, which is common in trading applications. The code maintains standard security practices, and there are no suspicious operations or signals of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured framework for technical analysis in Python. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage signs. It relies on external data fetching but does so through a typical approach with no evidence of malicious intent. The code appears safe for use in financial data analysis contexts.",
