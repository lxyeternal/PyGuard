  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a legitimate financial analysis framework, with no signs of malicious activity. It correctly notes that data is fetched via an external 'yf()' function, likely 'yfinance', which is standard. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious operations are detected.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — given the external data fetch, a minimal risk exists, but it's typical for such applications.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. The high confidence (0.95) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report emphasizes that the code is a standard financial analysis library, with data fetched via 'yf' (assumed 'yfinance'). It highlights the lack of malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The only concern is the undefined 'yf' function, but assuming it's the standard 'yfinance' library, this is benign.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent; no malicious code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — similar minimal risk due to external data fetching.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate. The confidence (0.8) is slightly lower than Report 1, which is acceptable given the ambiguity about 'yf', but overall justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes extensive dynamic attribute access and multiple imports, but finds no evidence of malicious activity. It recognizes the use of 'yf' for data retrieval but assumes it's the standard 'yfinance'. No backdoors, code injection, or malicious payloads are observed.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion; no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, standard for such analysis libraries.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent. The high confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, it describes a legitimate technical analysis framework. It mentions data fetched via 'yf' but finds no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, typical for external data fetch.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified; high confidence (0.9) is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report emphasizes the legitimacy of the code, with no malicious or sabotage signs. It recognizes data fetching via 'yf' and no suspicious operations.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with the other reports.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable; confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a legitimate financial analysis framework.\n- The primary external dependency ('yf') is assumed to be 'yfinance', which is standard and benign.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage is detected.\n- The scores assigned across reports are aligned with their reasoning and are reasonable.\n\n### **My Final Estimations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minimal risk due to external data fetching, which is typical and controlled.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code appears to be a well-structured, standard library for financial data analysis with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The external data fetch via 'yf' (likely 'yfinance') is common in such applications and does not pose a security concern in this context.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
