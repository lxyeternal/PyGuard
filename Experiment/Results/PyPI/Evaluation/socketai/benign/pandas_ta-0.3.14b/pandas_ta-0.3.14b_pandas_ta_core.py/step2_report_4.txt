  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: source, sink, flow, anomalies, and overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Legitimate financial analysis framework.\n- **Sources:** Data from pandas DataFrames, external data via `yf()` (likely yfinance).\n- **Sinks:** Data is written into DataFrame columns; no malicious sinks.\n- **Flow:** Data flows from DataFrame or external fetch into indicators, results appended back.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `yf()` for data retrieval; no malicious code observed.\n- **Analysis:** Standard pattern for financial data analysis. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code with very low malware risk (score 0). Confidence 0.95.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The overall security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Framework for applying indicators and strategies.\n- **Sources:** Data from pandas DataFrames, external via `yf()`.\n- **Sinks:** Data written into DataFrames; no unsafe command execution.\n- **Flow:** Data from external sources into DataFrames, processed, stored.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `yf()` for data fetching; no malicious code, but the implementation of `yf()` is not shown. Could be standard yfinance.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior. The only concern is the external data fetch, which is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely legitimate. Malware score 0, confidence 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected. The risk is low, assuming `yf()` is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines a module for financial analysis, extending pandas.\n- **Sources:** Data from DataFrames, user input, external data via `yf`.\n- **Sinks:** Data appended into DataFrames; no system commands or network activity.\n- **Flow:** Data from DataFrames and external sources into indicator functions.\n- **Anomalies:** Extensive dynamic attribute access, but no malicious code. `yf()` is external but assumed benign.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of sabotage or malware. Use of dynamic attribute access is standard in such frameworks.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low malware risk. Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior. The malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Provides a financial analysis library.\n- **Sources:** Data from pandas DataFrames, external data via `yf()`.\n- **Sinks:** Data written into DataFrames; no network or system commands.\n- **Flow:** Data flows from external sources into DataFrames, indicator functions, results stored.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `yf()` for data fetching; no malicious code, but the implementation is not shown.\n- **Analysis:** Standard data analysis code. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe for supply chain. Malware score 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The malware risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Technical analysis framework.\n- **Sources:** Data from DataFrames, external via `yf()`.\n- **Sinks:** Data appended into DataFrames; no network or system commands.\n- **Flow:** Data from external sources into DataFrames, indicator functions, results stored.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `yf()` for data fetch; no malicious code observed.\n- **Analysis:** Standard approach; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe for supply chain. Malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk scores:** Low, around 0.1–0.2, justified by the external data fetch via `yf()`, which is a standard practice in financial analysis tools.\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, comprehensive financial analysis framework.\n- The only potential concern is the external `yf()` function, which is not shown here. If `yf()` is the standard `yfinance` library, then data fetching is typical and safe.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, justified by external data fetch, which is standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe for use, with no evident security threats or malicious intent.",
