  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, logical consistency, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a pandas extension for financial analysis, with data from DataFrames, external data via yf() (likely yfinance).  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from DataFrame columns and external fetch into indicator functions; no malicious data handling is evident.  \n- **Anomalies:** External yf() function is suspicious but likely standard yfinance; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is a standard financial analysis framework.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, which is reasonable.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, considering the external data fetch but no malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No malware or malicious activity detected. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar framework; data fetched via yf (assumed yfinance).  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data from yfinance into pandas DataFrame; no unsafe data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** The main concern is the 'yf' function, which is not defined here but is presumably yfinance. No malicious code detected.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate extension for technical analysis; the only potential concern is the external data source, which is standard.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, justified given the benign context.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to reliance on external data fetch.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — slightly lower but still high.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious activity apparent. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar extension with pandas, indicator functions, and external data sources.  \n- **Anomalies:** Imports from pandas_ta, dynamic attribute access, but no malicious code. The 'yf' function is not shown but assumed to be yfinance.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is a standard analysis library.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0, justified.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is solid. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 & 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Both describe a similar pattern: pandas DataFrame extensions, data fetching via yfinance, indicator calculations, no direct malicious code.  \n- The main concern is the 'yf' function, which is not shown but is a common pattern for Yahoo Finance data fetch.  \n- No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.  \n- The code's structure and purpose are legitimate.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, justified.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, considering external data fetch.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, legitimate financial analysis framework.\n- The primary external dependency 'yf' (assumed yfinance) is a normal data source, not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.\n- Scores for malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are appropriate across reports.\n- Security risks are low, primarily due to external data fetching, which is typical in such applications.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to reliance on external data sources, which is common and not inherently risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and aligned with its intended purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**  \n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.  \n- No adjustments needed unless further context about 'yf' or external dependencies suggests otherwise.",
