{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing various statistical functions from local modules, likely for data analysis or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules such as .entropy, .kurtosis, .mad, etc.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only import statements are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward module imports",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports several functions related to statistical measures from local modules. There are no functions, data handling, or suspicious behaviors. It does not perform any computation, network activity, or system modification. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import section, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears benign and solely defines dependencies for further processing.",
