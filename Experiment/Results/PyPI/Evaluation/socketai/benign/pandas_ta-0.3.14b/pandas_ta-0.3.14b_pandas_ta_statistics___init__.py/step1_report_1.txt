{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module importing various statistical functions such as entropy, kurtosis, median, skewness, standard deviation, variance, z-score, etc., likely for data analysis or processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules/files (entropy, kurtosis, mad, median, quantile, skew, stdev, tos_stdevall, variance, zscore)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in this snippet; the code only imports functions, no data handling or output functions are shown.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; this code is only importing functions, which might be used elsewhere in the project.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The imports are straightforward and align with typical data analysis modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of import statements from local modules, indicating that it is part of a larger data analysis package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions imported are common statistical measures, which by themselves do not indicate malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or unusual code constructs. Since this is just an import list, the overall security risk is very low. There are no indications of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import module for statistical functions, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
