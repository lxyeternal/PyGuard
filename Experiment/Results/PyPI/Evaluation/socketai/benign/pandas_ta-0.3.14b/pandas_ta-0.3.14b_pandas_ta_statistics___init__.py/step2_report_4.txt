  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as simple import statements from local modules related to statistical functions.\n- No report detects any suspicious behavior, data handling, or malicious activity.\n- The code snippet is straightforward, with no obfuscation, external network activity, or data exfiltration indicated.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1), which aligns with the simplicity of the code.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n- **Reports 1-5:** They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. They assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, matching the straightforward import statements.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty based on the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or considerations:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements, there's little room for malicious activity within this snippet.\n- However, if the imported modules themselves contain malicious code, that could pose a risk. But based solely on this snippet, no such issues are evident.\n- The reports do not mention any external dependencies or runtime behaviors that could be malicious, which aligns with the code shown.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n- The overall risk is negligible; the code appears benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward imports)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code itself is safe, always consider the context of the imported modules. If those modules are from untrusted sources or contain malicious code, the risk could be higher. But based solely on this snippet, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports' assessments are accurate.\n- The scores are justified and should remain as they are.\n- No further action needed.",
