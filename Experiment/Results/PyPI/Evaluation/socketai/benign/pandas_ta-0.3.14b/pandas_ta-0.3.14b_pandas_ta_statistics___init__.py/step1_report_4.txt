  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a statistical or data analysis module, importing various statistical functions from local modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements loading functions such as entropy, kurtosis, mad, median, quantile, skew, stdev, tos_stdevall, variance, zscore from relative modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions like network communication, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions, but there are no data flows or processing logic shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The imports seem standard for statistical analysis.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a simple set of import statements from local modules related to statistical computations. There are no visible data inputs, processing, or outputs. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment. It is a typical structure for a Python package organizing statistical functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import setup for a data analysis package with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on this snippet.",
