  "purpose": "Import statements for statistical functions from local modules, likely part of a data analysis package.",
  "sources": "The import statements themselves; no data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, output, or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - only static import statements; no data flow or execution beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules related to statistical functions such as entropy, kurtosis, mad, median, quantile, skew, stdev, tos_stdevall, variance, and zscore. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, data leakage, or network operations. The functions are standard statistical tools, and the code structure is typical for a utility package. The high confidence scores (1) in the reports are justified. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident within this snippet. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should remain at 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements for statistical functions with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
