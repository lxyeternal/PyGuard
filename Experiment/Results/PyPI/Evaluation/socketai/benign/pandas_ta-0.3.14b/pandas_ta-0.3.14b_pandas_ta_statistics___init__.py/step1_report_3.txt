{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python module that imports various statistical functions or metrics such as entropy, kurtosis, median, skewness, standard deviation, variance, and z-score, likely for data analysis or feature extraction.",
  "sources": "The code reads data through the imported functions, which presumably operate on datasets or data streams provided elsewhere in the application.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data (datasets) would flow into the imported functions during runtime; however, no direct flow or data manipulation is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of import statements with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "This module imports several statistical functions from sibling modules within the package. There is no code execution, data handling, or external communication in this snippet. The structure appears standard and intended for data processing tasks. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected based solely on import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import module containing statistical functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears benign and typical for a data analysis package.",
