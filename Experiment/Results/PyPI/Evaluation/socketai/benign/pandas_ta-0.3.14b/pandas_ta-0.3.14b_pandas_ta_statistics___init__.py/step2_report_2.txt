  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code snippet:\n\n1. **Code Content Analysis:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements from local modules related to statistical functions (entropy, kurtosis, mad, median, quantile, skew, stdev, tos_stdevall, variance, zscore).\n   - There are no data manipulations, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns.\n   - The structure is typical for a Python package organizing statistical utilities.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import module, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - They uniformly conclude a low security risk, which aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Issues in Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - No report claims the presence of malicious behavior, which is correct given the code.\n   - No false positives or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   \n   Since the code is purely import statements with no suspicious or malicious content, these scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - There is no justification for raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores based solely on this snippet.\n   - The data flow or context outside this snippet could change the risk profile, but with only this code, the assessment remains low.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified given the straightforward analysis.\n\n7. **Final Expert Judgment:**\n   - Based on the code and reports, the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be **0**.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign set of import statements for statistical functions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores in the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence at hand.",
