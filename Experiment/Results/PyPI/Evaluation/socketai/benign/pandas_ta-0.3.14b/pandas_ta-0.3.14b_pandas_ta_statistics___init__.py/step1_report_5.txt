{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing statistical functions or metrics from local modules within a package, likely for data analysis or processing.",
  "sources": "The source is the local module imports, specifically importing functions such as entropy, kurtosis, mad, median, etc., from sibling modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code snippet; it does not perform any data handling, network operations, or output actions.",
  "flows": "Since the code only contains import statements, there are no data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual constructs. It consists solely of import statements without any dynamic code execution or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module import section, importing various statistical functions from local modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The imports are typical for a data analysis package. No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, are detected. The code structure is clear and standard for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import section with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a data analysis or statistical processing package with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
