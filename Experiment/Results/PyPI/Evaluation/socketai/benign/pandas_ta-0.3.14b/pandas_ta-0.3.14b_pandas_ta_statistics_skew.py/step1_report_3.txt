{
  "purpose": "Calculate the rolling skewness indicator for a series of close prices.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'close' parameter and optional 'min_periods' in kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Returns a pandas Series object with calculated skewness; no external or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' data flows into verify_series, then into pandas rolling skew calculation, with optional shifting and filling; output flows as a pandas Series.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code is standard for statistical calculation with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies input data, computes rolling skewness, applies optional shifting and filling methods, and labels the output Series with descriptive name and category. No external data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behavior present. The use of pandas functions appears standard and safe. No signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a statistical indicator using pandas, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It performs data processing in a typical manner without any suspicious patterns.",
