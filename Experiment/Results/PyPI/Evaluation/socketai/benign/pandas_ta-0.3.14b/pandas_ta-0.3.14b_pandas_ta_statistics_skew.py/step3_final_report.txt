  "purpose": "Calculate the rolling skewness of a pandas Series representing 'close' prices, used as a technical indicator in financial analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'close' pandas Series; utilizes utility functions 'verify_series' and 'get_offset' for validation and offset calculation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a pandas Series with the computed skewness; no external data sinks or network operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' Series flows through validation, then into pandas' rolling().skew() function, optionally shifted by 'offset', with missing data filled as specified, resulting in the output Series.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external data leaks; the code is straightforward and relies solely on pandas functions and utility helpers.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard statistical calculation of skewness over a rolling window, with input validation and optional shifting. It does not contain any malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation. Utility functions are from a trusted library, and the implementation aligns with best practices for such indicators. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of a technical analysis indicator. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified given its straightforward nature.",
