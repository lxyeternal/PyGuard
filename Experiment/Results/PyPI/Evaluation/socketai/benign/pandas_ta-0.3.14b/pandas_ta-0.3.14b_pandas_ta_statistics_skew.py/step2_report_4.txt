  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that the code calculates rolling skewness of a pandas Series representing close prices.\n   - The implementation uses standard pandas functions (`rolling().skew()`) and utility functions (`verify_series`, `get_offset`) from pandas_ta.utils.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are reported or evident.\n   - The code handles input validation, optional shifting, and missing data filling appropriately.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, confirming the code performs a legitimate statistical calculation.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified in the code.\n   - The reasoning is sound: the code is a straightforward implementation of a common technical indicator.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risks (0.1 or 0). This aligns with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - The scores of `malware=0` and `securityRisk=0.1` are reasonable given the code's benign purpose.\n   - The `securityRisk` of 0.1 is slightly above zero, perhaps to account for minimal risk associated with code execution in an environment, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n   - Since the code only performs pandas operations without external network or file access, these scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's operations and lack of suspicious patterns.\n   - The reasoning is conservative and justified.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated but justified due to potential environment risks; overall very low.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, safe implementation of a statistical indicator with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**Therefore, my final scores are:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and poses no security threat.",
