{
  "purpose": "Calculate the rolling skewness of a pandas Series, specifically for financial 'close' prices, as a technical indicator.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'close' (pd.Series), optional 'length', 'offset', and fill-related kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily processes pandas Series and performs calculations.",
  "flows": "Reads 'close' Series and parameters; computes rolling skew; optionally shifts results; fills missing values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses standard pandas operations and utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute the rolling skewness of a pandas Series representing close prices. It validates inputs, uses pandas rolling and skew functions, manages offsets, and handles missing data with fillna or fill_method. Utility functions verify_series and get_offset are imported from pandas_ta.utils, suggesting reliance on established libraries. There are no signs of code injection, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve a legitimate technical analysis purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for calculating a statistical indicator with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only performs data processing using pandas and related utilities, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
