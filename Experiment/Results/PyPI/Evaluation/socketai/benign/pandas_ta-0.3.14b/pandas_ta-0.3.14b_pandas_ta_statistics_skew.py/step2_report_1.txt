  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward implementation of a rolling skewness indicator using pandas. It performs input validation, uses pandas rolling().skew(), handles optional shifting and filling, and assigns descriptive metadata.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or external data leaks are evident.\n   - The utility functions `verify_series` and `get_offset` are imported from `pandas_ta.utils`, which are standard utility functions for data validation and offset calculation.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and well-structured for its purpose.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is standard, uses pandas functions, and lacks malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - They mention the absence of obfuscation and external network activity.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, `obfuscated` scores of 0, and very low `securityRisk` scores (mostly 0 or 0.1).\n   - These seem reasonable given the analysis; the code is purely computational and does not perform any risky operations.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores are consistent with the findings; no changes needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest `securityRisk` score is 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The malware scores are 0, and obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the conclusion that there's no malicious or obfuscated code.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher scores is necessary; the current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - No malicious activity or code patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's functionality and standard pandas operations.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - The low security risk and malware scores match the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to the code's computational nature without external interactions)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe implementation of a statistical indicator with no security concerns.**",
