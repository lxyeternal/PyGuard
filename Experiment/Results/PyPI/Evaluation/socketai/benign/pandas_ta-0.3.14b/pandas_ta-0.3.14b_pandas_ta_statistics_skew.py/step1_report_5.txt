  "purpose": "Calculate the rolling skewness indicator for a pandas Series of closing prices.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'close' pandas Series parameter, as well as 'kwargs' for optional fill methods and offset.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, network, or files. It processes data locally and returns a pandas Series object.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' data flows into verify_series, then into the pandas rolling skew calculation, possibly shifted by offset, and finally returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input data, calculates a statistical metric (skewness) over a rolling window, applies optional offset and fill methods, and sets metadata attributes. It uses pandas functions securely and does not perform any network activity, file manipulation, or hidden operations. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a statistical indicator with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for financial data analysis.",
