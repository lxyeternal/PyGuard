{
  "purpose": "The code calculates the rolling skewness of a pandas Series, specifically the 'close' prices, for statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'close' pandas Series and optional keyword arguments for parameters like 'min_periods', 'fillna', and 'fill_method'.",
  "sinks": "Returns a pandas Series object with the calculated skewness, which could be used further downstream or visualized.",
  "flows": "Inputs are validated and processed; the 'close' data flows into the rolling skew calculation; optional fill methods modify the result; the output is shifted by 'offset' if specified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard pandas operations. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility functions for data verification and offset calculation, then defines a function to compute the rolling skewness. It validates input parameters, verifies the input data series, computes the skewness over a specified window, applies optional shifting and filling, and labels the resulting series. All operations are standard pandas DataFrame manipulations with no indication of malicious intent. The docstring clearly states the function's purpose and parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate statistical calculation of rolling skewness for financial data analysis. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. It is a standard, safe implementation.",
