{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to compute a rolling quantile indicator on a pandas Series, typically used in financial data analysis for technical indicators.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'close' parameter, which is verified to be a pandas Series using verify_series.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; the code performs in-memory calculations only.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' -> verified Series -> rolling quantile calculation -> optional offset shift -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard for a pandas-based indicator. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity. Use of verify_series and get_offset functions suggests standard library use, no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility functions, performs input validation, computes a rolling quantile, applies optional offset and fill methods, and labels the resulting Series. All operations are typical for a technical indicator. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code seems to be a legitimate financial indicator implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a rolling quantile indicator for financial data analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
