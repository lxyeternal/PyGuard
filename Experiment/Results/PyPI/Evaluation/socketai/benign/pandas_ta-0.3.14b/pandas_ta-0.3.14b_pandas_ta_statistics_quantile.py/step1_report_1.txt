  "purpose": "Calculate a rolling quantile on a pandas Series, typically used for technical analysis in financial data.",
  "sources": "The 'close' parameter, which is verified as a pandas Series, and optional kwargs such as 'min_periods', 'fillna', and 'fill_method'.",
  "sinks": "The returned pandas Series 'quantile', which may be used downstream; no explicit data leakage or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' -> verification and rolling quantile calculation -> optional fillna or fill_method -> output 'quantile'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic present. Use of pandas functions and kwargs is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies input data, calculates a rolling quantile, optionally offsets and fills missing values, and assigns metadata. No external data connections or suspicious behaviors are observed. The only inputs are pandas Series and optional parameters for calculation adjustments. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The code is well-structured, using common pandas operations for financial analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard statistical calculation for financial data analysis. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a typical, safe implementation of a rolling quantile indicator.",
