{
  "purpose": "Calculate a rolling quantile indicator for a pandas Series, primarily used for technical analysis in financial data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'close' pandas Series, and optional kwargs for fillna and fill_method.",
  "sinks": "Returns a pandas Series object with the calculated quantile, which could potentially be used downstream for further analysis or visualization.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' -> verify_series -> rolling quantile calculation -> optional fillna/ fill_method -> return quantile Series.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious system calls. The code uses standard pandas operations without any unusual or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data validation, calculates a rolling quantile, applies optional filling strategies, and labels the Series. There are no external data transmissions, no system modifications, or malicious injections present. It utilizes standard pandas and pandas_ta utility functions for validation and offset handling. No suspicious patterns or malicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a statistical indicator with no malicious intent. It is a typical financial data processing function without any suspicious behavior.",
