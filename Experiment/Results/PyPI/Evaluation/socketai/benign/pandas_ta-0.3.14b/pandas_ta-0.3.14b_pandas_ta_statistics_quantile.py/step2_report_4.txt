  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n- **Code Functionality:** The code calculates a rolling quantile on a pandas Series, with optional offset and fill methods. It uses standard pandas functions and utility functions (`verify_series`, `get_offset`), which are typical in financial data analysis.\n\n- **Security & Malicious Behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, external data exfiltration, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The operations are straightforward and standard.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** Slight mention of a security risk score of 0.1 in one report, but without elaboration. This appears to be a very low, possibly default or precautionary score.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports indicate no malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, with some assigning a security risk score of 0 or very close to it. The highest risk score is 0.1, which is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Consistency:\n- The code matches the described purpose: computing a rolling quantile.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n- The use of pandas functions and utility functions is standard and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external communications.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The only minor point is the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in one report, which seems unwarranted given the code's nature.\n\n### Scores & Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports suggest very low or zero risk, which aligns with the code's function.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of a financial indicator.\n- No malicious intent or security risks are evident.\n- The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is likely an overestimate; it should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.05 if considering minimal default risk, but 0 is more accurate)\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured, and secure. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Work through this step-by-step, and the overall security assessment confirms that this code is safe and free of malicious intent.**",
