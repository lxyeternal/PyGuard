{
  "purpose": "The code implements a financial indicator function that calculates the rolling quantile of a series of closing prices, primarily used in technical analysis for financial data.",
  "sources": "Data source is the 'close' series, verified via verify_series, which reads input data for the indicator calculation.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a pandas Series object with the calculated quantile, which can be used downstream in analysis or visualization. No data sinks that could leak or exfiltrate untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'close' input through verification, then into a rolling quantile calculation, possibly offset, and then returned as a pandas Series object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code relies on standard pandas operations and library functions. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network access, file manipulations, or credential handling are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a rolling quantile indicator using pandas functions. It verifies input data, calculates the quantile with configurable parameters, applies optional offset and fill methods, and labels the output Series accordingly. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or hidden backdoors are present. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard implementation of a financial indicator with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs data processing solely within the pandas framework without external communications or security-sensitive operations.",
