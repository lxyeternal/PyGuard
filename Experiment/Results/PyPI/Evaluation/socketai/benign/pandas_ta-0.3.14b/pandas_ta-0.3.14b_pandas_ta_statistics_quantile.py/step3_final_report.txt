  "purpose": "Calculate a rolling quantile on a pandas Series with optional offset and fill methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'close' pandas Series; uses utility functions 'verify_series' and 'get_offset'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; no untrusted data effects identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' -> verify_series -> rolling quantile calculation -> optional offset shift -> fillna handling -> output Series.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external data leaks; the 'category' attribute assignment is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a pandas-based rolling quantile indicator, performing input validation, calculation, optional offset, and fill handling. It uses common pandas functions and utility methods, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or external communication. The metadata assignment is typical for internal categorization. No anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs a standard statistical calculation without security risks or malicious intent. The absence of suspicious patterns and external effects indicates a safe implementation.",
