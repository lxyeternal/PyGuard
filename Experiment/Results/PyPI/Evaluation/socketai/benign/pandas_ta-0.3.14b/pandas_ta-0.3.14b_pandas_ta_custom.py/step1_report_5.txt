  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for managing, importing, and dynamically loading custom indicator modules into the pandas_ta library, facilitating user extension of technical analysis indicators.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the filesystem (directory paths, module files), and sys.path for module imports.",
  "sinks": "Dynamically imported modules execute functions which could contain malicious code, but no direct sinks for untrusted data are present; no network or system modification code is evident.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths -> module import via importlib -> function binding into pandas_ta objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports modules and binds functions without validation of module content or function safety. It manipulates sys.path, which could be exploited for malicious imports. No explicit validation or sandboxing of imported code is present. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages filesystem directories, dynamically imports Python modules from specified directories, and binds functions from these modules to the pandas_ta library for extending indicators. It includes functions to create directory structures, retrieve module functions, and load modules dynamically, all of which are standard utility procedures. The import_dir function can import arbitrary code, which could be malicious if an attacker places malicious modules in the directory. However, no network, system modification, or data exfiltration code is present. The code lacks validation of imported modules' content, but this is typical for plugin systems. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are identified. The overall design is straightforward, and no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a plugin loader for pandas_ta, enabling users to add custom indicators. While it does allow dynamic code execution, there are no signs of malicious behavior or malware in the provided code itself. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the modules placed in the import directories; malicious modules could be executed if present. Overall, the code appears safe but relies on external trust in the imported modules.",
