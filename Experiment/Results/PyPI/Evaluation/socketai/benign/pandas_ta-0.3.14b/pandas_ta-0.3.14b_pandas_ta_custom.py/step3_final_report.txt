  "purpose": "Utility functions to dynamically import, manage, and bind custom indicator modules into pandas_ta, enabling seamless extension of pandas_ta with user-defined indicators.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories containing Python modules (*.py files), specifically within specified category subfolders; module import via importlib.import_module; module reload via importlib.reload.",
  "sinks": "Execution of module code during import or reload, which can include malicious payloads if modules are untrusted; binding functions into pandas_ta and AnalysisIndicators without validation.",
  "flows": "Filesystem scan -> importlib.import_module -> module code execution -> get_module_functions -> bind functions to pandas_ta and AnalysisIndicators",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.reload on modules from untrusted sources; no validation or sandboxing; printing messages revealing internal states; dynamic import from user-controlled directories.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates dynamic plugin management by importing modules from user-supplied directories, reloading them, and binding their functions into pandas_ta. While the code itself is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads, the use of importlib.import_module and importlib.reload on untrusted modules can execute arbitrary code, posing security risks. The functions are bound directly without validation, increasing the attack surface if malicious modules are introduced. The code's primary risk is external—malicious modules could perform harmful actions during import or execution. The code does not contain malicious code or obfuscation itself, but its design inherently allows execution of arbitrary code from external sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader for pandas_ta, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The main security concern is the execution of untrusted modules during import or reload, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The malware score should be 0, as no malicious code is present within the code itself. The obfuscated score remains 0. The security risk score should be moderate (~0.4), reflecting the potential danger when importing untrusted modules. Overall, the code is safe if used with trusted modules, but caution is advised when importing from unverified sources.",
