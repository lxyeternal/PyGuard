  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code behavior, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**  \nHighlights that the code dynamically imports modules, reloads them, and binds functions into pandas_ta. It emphasizes that malicious modules could execute arbitrary code, especially since importlib.reload is used on untrusted modules.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does **not** contain obfuscation or explicit malware.  \n- The main concern is the **dynamic import and reload** of modules from untrusted sources, which could execute malicious code during import or reload.  \n- The report correctly assigns a **malware score of 0.9** and a **security risk of 0.9**, justified by the high potential for malicious code execution via dynamic import/reload.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's behavior. The high malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**  \nStates that the code manages custom indicator modules, with potential risk points at dynamic import and execution, but finds no malicious intent or code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is primarily filesystem management and dynamic import of modules.  \n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The risk is moderate, depending on trustworthiness of modules.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security risk: 0.4 (reasonable, given the potential for malicious modules)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe scores are consistent. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**  \nDescribes the code as a utility for importing and binding modules, emphasizing that dynamic import/reload could be exploited but no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is standard plugin management, with no malicious payloads.  \n- The risk arises solely from untrusted modules, which could contain malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (low, assuming trusted modules)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**  \nStates that the code allows dynamic extension via module import, with potential risk if untrusted modules are used, but no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a plugin loader with no malicious intent.  \n- The primary concern is trusting the modules supplied.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**  \nSimilar to others, emphasizes that dynamic import can execute arbitrary code if modules are malicious, but no malicious code is present in the code itself.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is a plugin system, with inherent risk if modules are malicious.  \n- No obfuscation or malware signatures.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n## Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree that the code itself does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main risk is the potential for malicious modules to be imported and executed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Vary from 0.2 to 0.9 depending on the emphasis on dynamic import risks.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n- The code **does not** contain malware or obfuscation.\n- The **malware score** should be **0**, given no malicious code is present.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain **0**.\n- The **security risk score** should reflect the potential danger of executing untrusted modules. Given the analysis, a **score of around 0.4** seems appropriate, considering the potential for malicious modules to execute arbitrary code during import or reload.\n\n---\n\n## **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.4 (moderate risk if untrusted modules are used)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus but slightly adjusts the malware score downward, as no actual malicious code or signatures are present in the provided code snippet.",
