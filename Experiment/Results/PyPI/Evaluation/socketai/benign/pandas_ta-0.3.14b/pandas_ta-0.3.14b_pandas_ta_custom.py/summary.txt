  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader for pandas_ta, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The main security concern is the execution of untrusted modules during import or reload, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The malware score should be 0, as no malicious code is present within the code itself. The obfuscated score remains 0. The security risk score should be moderate (~0.4), reflecting the potential danger when importing untrusted modules. Overall, the code is safe if used with trusted modules, but caution is advised when importing from unverified sources."
