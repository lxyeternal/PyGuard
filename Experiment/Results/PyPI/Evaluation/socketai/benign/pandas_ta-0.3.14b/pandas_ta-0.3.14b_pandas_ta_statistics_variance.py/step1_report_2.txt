{
  "purpose": "Calculate the rolling variance of a pandas Series, optionally using TA-Lib's variance function.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'close' (pd.Series), optional 'kwargs' for fillna and fill_method, environment variable for 'Imports' and 'talib' detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external network or file operations occur.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' flows through verification and calculation steps, with optional offset shift applied before returning the result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors. The code uses standard pandas operations and conditional import from 'talib'.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input parameters, verifies the input series, and conditionally uses TA-Lib's VAR function or pandas rolling variance. It applies optional offset shifting and fillna methods as specified. No external data is fetched or sent. The imports are checked at runtime. Overall, the code appears straightforward and focused on statistical calculation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a rolling variance indicator, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely uses third-party libraries and pandas features. No malware indicators detected. Overall security risk is minimal.",
