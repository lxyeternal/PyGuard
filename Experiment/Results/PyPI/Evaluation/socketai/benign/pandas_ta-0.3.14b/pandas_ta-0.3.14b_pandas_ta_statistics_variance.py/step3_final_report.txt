  "purpose": "Calculate rolling variance of a pandas Series, optionally using TA-Lib's VAR function if available.",
  "sources": "Input pandas Series 'close', optional parameters like 'length', 'ddof', 'offset', and fill options.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed in-memory, with optional fillna operations; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' -> validation and parameter setup -> calculation via pandas rolling or TA-Lib VAR -> optional offset shift -> fillna handling -> output Series with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a rolling variance indicator, using pandas and optionally TA-Lib. It performs input validation, conditional import, and calculation with proper handling of missing data and offsets. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is transparent, well-structured, and relies on common libraries. The fillna operations and optional TA-Lib usage are typical and do not introduce security risks. The metadata attributes are correctly assigned. Overall, the code is benign and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a statistical indicator with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The risk score could be further minimized to near zero, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
