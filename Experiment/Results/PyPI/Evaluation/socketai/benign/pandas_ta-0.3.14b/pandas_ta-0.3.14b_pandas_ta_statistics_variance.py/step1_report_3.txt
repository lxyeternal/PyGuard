  "purpose": "Calculate the rolling variance of a pandas Series, primarily for technical analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'close' pandas Series; reads configuration parameters from function arguments and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Returns a pandas Series object with calculated variance; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input Series 'close' flows into verification and calculation; computed variance may be shifted; results returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic; no obfuscation or hidden code; uses standard pandas and talib functions when available.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies inputs and calculates a rolling variance either via pandas or talib, depending on availability and settings. It manages missing data with fill options, adjusts for offset, and sets metadata. No external data is fetched or sent, no network or file system access, no code injections, and no malicious logic observed. The code follows typical statistical computation patterns and contains no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard implementation for calculating statistical variance in a financial data context. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk is minimal.",
