  "purpose": "Environment introspection, dependency detection, static configuration setup for pandas_ta library.",
  "sources": "get_distribution, find_spec, static data structures, module imports",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, no external data handling, no network activity",
  "flows": "Dependency detection and environment checks are static; no dynamic data flows or untrusted input processing",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with standard dependency and environment detection practices",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency detection via get_distribution and find_spec, defines static categories and constants, and imports core modules. It contains no user input, network activity, or obfuscated code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The dependency checks are standard and do not execute untrusted code. The code is purely configuration and environment detection, typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dependency detection and static configuration are standard practices. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the benign nature of the script.",
