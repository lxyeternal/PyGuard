{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures the pandas_ta package, performing dependency checks, setting categories for technical indicators, and defining constants related to trading and market data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package distribution location, system specifications, and dynamically checks for the presence of various optional dependencies using importlib.util.find_spec.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present that process untrusted input; the code primarily reads system and package info without handling external user input or untrusted data streams.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading package distribution info and dynamically checking for optional modules; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors observed. The dependency checks and static configurations are standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic module discovery via find_spec is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with environment introspection and static configuration. It uses get_distribution and Path to verify installation paths, along with importlib's find_spec for optional modules. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic is evident. The use of try-except around DistributionNotFound is standard for dependency handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware. The only notable aspect is dynamic dependency detection, which is a common pattern in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate setup and configuration script for pandas_ta, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply checks for dependencies, defines configuration constants, and imports core modules, all in a standard manner.",
