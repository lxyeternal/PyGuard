{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures the pandas_ta library, including dynamic imports, version detection, categorization of indicators, and constants related to trading data.",
  "sources": "get_distribution from pkg_resources, find_spec from importlib.util, __file__, environment variables, module attributes, static string literals, and imported core modules.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; code does not write untrusted data, execute external commands, or handle sensitive data directly.",
  "flows": "No evident untrusted data flow paths; module imports and variable assignments are static or sourced from trusted library functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors. Use of get_distribution and find_spec is standard for environment and dependency checks. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency and version detection via standard library functions, with fallbacks for missing dependencies. It categorizes trading indicators and constants statically. No input validation or untrusted data handling is involved. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor code. The import statements and dependency checks are typical for package initialization scripts. The structure and logic are straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup/configuration module for a trading analysis library, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The dependency checks and static configurations are standard and safe.",
