{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python module for technical analysis, importing various packages and defining data structures for financial data processing.",
  "sources": "get_distribution (PyPI package info), find_spec (importlib, installed modules), __file__ (local file path), external package imports",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external network calls are present",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks; primarily static setup and imports",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard module setup, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. It does rely on package metadata and module discovery, but these are typical for such modules.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily initializes module metadata, detects installed dependencies, and categorizes functions for financial analysis. It uses standard Python libraries and package management functions without executing untrusted code. There are no code injection points, external network communications, or other suspicious behaviors. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks. The use of dynamic package discovery is typical for optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a financial analysis library, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, hidden backdoors, or security risks based on its content. It appears safe and legitimate, serving as an organized configuration and dependency checker.",
