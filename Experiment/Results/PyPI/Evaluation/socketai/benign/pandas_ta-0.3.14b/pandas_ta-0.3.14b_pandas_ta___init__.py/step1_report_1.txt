{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and configure the pandas_ta library, importing dependencies, defining categories of technical analysis indicators, and setting constants for trading calculations.",
  "sources": "get_distribution, find_spec, __file__, and imported modules from pandas_ta.core",
  "sinks": "None of the source code shows untrusted data being passed into sensitive functions or system calls",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules and dependencies, checking for package presence, defining configuration dictionaries, and importing core functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. No unusual or malicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration and setup code, managing package information, environment detection, and defining constants. No input validation, user input handling, or external data processing occurs that could lead to data leakage or injection. The use of get_distribution and find_spec is for environment introspection. All modules and variables appear standard and related to financial data analysis. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly setup and configuration for a technical analysis library. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this code snippet.",
