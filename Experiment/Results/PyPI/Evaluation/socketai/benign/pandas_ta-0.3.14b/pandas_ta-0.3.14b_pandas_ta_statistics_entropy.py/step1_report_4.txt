{
  "purpose": "Calculate the entropy of a financial time series (close prices) as a statistical indicator.",
  "sources": "Data input from the 'close' pandas Series parameter; uses 'verify_series' to validate input data.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data exfiltration or malicious effects; no network or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' -> validation via verify_series -> calculations of probabilities and entropy -> optional shifting and filling -> return of entropy series.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard statistical calculations using well-known libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input data, calculates probability distributions, and computes entropy based on Shannon's information theory. It utilizes numpy and pandas utilities for data manipulation. No suspicious or malicious code structures, network calls, or backdoors are present. The only external dependencies are standard libraries (numpy, pandas_ta), which are common in data analysis tasks. No signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of entropy calculation for time series data. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. The security risk level is minimal, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
