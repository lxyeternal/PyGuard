{
  "purpose": "Calculate the entropy (information unpredictability) of a financial series, specifically the 'close' prices, using Shannon entropy formula.",
  "sources": "Reads 'close' data series; uses 'verify_series' and 'get_offset' utility functions; accesses rolling sum and logarithmic calculations.",
  "sinks": "Performs in-memory calculations only; no data is written to external systems or network connections; no untrusted data is sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'close' series -> processes via verify_series -> computes probability distribution -> calculates entropy -> applies offset and fill methods -> outputs series.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-documented. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates Shannon entropy on a pandas Series of close prices, using logarithms and rolling sums. It relies on trusted libraries (numpy, pandas_ta utils) and contains no network operations, file I/O, or external commands. The use of verify_series and get_offset suggests input validation. No hidden or malicious code patterns are evident. The fillna and fill_method options are standard pandas operations. The code appears to be a legitimate financial indicator implementation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a statistical calculation of entropy on a data series with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses common data processing techniques and well-known libraries. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
