  "purpose": "Calculate the entropy (uncertainty) of a series of 'close' prices over a specified window, using information theory principles.",
  "sources": "Reading 'close' series input, verifying series, obtaining offset, and reading optional fillna and fill_method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if 'close' or other inputs are maliciously manipulated, but no direct data output or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'close' -> verify_series -> compute rolling probabilities -> compute entropy -> apply offset and fills -> output series.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code strictly computes a statistical metric. No suspicious dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries and defines a function to calculate entropy of a series. It verifies input series, calculates probabilities, applies logarithmic functions, and handles optional filling of missing data. The function only performs mathematical operations related to statistical analysis. There are no external connections, no code injection, or hidden behaviors. The documentation is standard and references information theory. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an entropy indicator based on historical data series. It appears to be intended for technical analysis in finance, with no malicious intent or security risks. No malware or security concerns are detected.",
