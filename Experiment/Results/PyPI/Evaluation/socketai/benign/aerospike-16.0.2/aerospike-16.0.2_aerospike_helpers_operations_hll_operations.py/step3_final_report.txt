  "purpose": "Helper functions to create HyperLogLog operation dictionaries for Aerospike client API calls, facilitating HLL add, describe, fold, get count, intersect, similarity, union, and initialization operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as bin_name, values, index_bit_count, mh_bit_count, policy, and other operation-specific arguments.",
  "sinks": "Generated dictionaries passed to aerospike.Client.operate or aerospike.Client.operate_ordered methods; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assembled into dictionaries which are then used in database operations; no external or untrusted data flows outside these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that construct dictionaries representing HLL operations for Aerospike. They accept parameters and produce data structures for API calls. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The functions are well-structured, with clear purpose, and do not contain obfuscation or malicious logic. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the low inherent risk of API helper code, assuming correct usage. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured helper library for Aerospike HyperLogLog operations. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are accurate and appropriate.",
