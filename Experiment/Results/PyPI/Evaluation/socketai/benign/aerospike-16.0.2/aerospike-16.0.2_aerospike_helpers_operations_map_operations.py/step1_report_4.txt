  "purpose": "Helper functions to create map operation dictionaries for Aerospike client operations, supporting nested CDT contexts.",
  "sources": "Imports aerospike, sys, and typing; functions receive parameters such as bin names, policies, keys, values, and context lists.",
  "sinks": "Returns dictionaries with operation keys and parameters for Aerospike client. No external untrusted input is processed directly in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, which generate operation dictionaries. No data flows to external sinks like network or file writes within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code. Use of type hints and optional parameters appears standard. No unusual or unexpected behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to generate operation dictionaries for map operations in Aerospike. It uses standard patterns for optional parameters and context handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. All functions seem purpose-built for client operation construction. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are present. The code is clean, well-structured, and appears to be a legitimate SDK helper module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign helper module for constructing Aerospike map operation commands. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply formats parameters into dictionaries for client use, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
