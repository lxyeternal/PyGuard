  "purpose": "Helper functions to create map operation dictionaries for Aerospike client operations, supporting nested CDT contexts and various map manipulation methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements (aerospike, sys, typing), function arguments (bin_name, policy, ctx, etc.), dictionary constructions, sorted key functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements producing operation dictionaries, dictionary accesses and modifications, function calls with arguments, conditional insertions into dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (including ctx, policies, keys, values) flow into dictionary constructions; these dictionaries are used as operation arguments for Aerospike client methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The code is focused on building data structures for database operations without any network, file, or system command execution. The sorting function uses sys.version_info but only for compatibility, not malicious logic. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of helper functions for constructing operation dictionaries for Aerospike map operations. It uses standard Python features such as dictionary manipulation, optional parameters, and conditional inclusion of context arguments. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious system interaction. All functions are straightforward, aimed at internal API call preparation. The use of sys.version_info is solely for compatibility, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as a utility module for building map operation arguments for Aerospike client interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The functions perform expected data structure preparations for database operations, with no network activity or system compromise code.",
