{
  "purpose": "This code provides helper functions to create map operation dictionaries for use with Aerospike client operations, including various map manipulations such as put, get, remove, range queries, and policies.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as bin names, keys, values, ranges, policies, context lists, and return types; no external untrusted input sources are explicitly handled.",
  "sinks": "Constructs operation dictionaries for Aerospike client method calls, which will be executed on the database server.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assembled into dictionaries (sources) and passed to Aerospike client methods (sinks). There are no direct untrusted data flows to system commands, network, or file I/O within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious network activity; the code is straightforward and appears as standard helper functions. No suspicious logic or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for creating operation dictionaries for map manipulations in Aerospike. It uses standard Python data structures, relies on parameters provided to functions, and constructs dictionaries for client API calls. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized network access. The code only handles data assembly for client operations and includes no network or system commands. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or secrets are present. The overall logic is typical for a helper library meant for database operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard helper module for Aerospike map operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and legitimate, serving its purpose of creating operation dictionaries for client use without any malicious behavior.",
