  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is helper functions for Aerospike map operations, with no external or untrusted input sources explicitly present.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The functions generate dictionaries for client calls; no network or system calls are made here.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment correctly identifies this as benign, with high confidence (0.95). Malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar helper functions for Aerospike, with input parameters from function calls, no external untrusted sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The generated operation dictionaries are used for database commands, but no direct external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Straightforward, standard helper functions, no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identified as legitimate, with perfect confidence (1). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; helper functions, no external untrusted input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Constructs operation dictionaries for client calls; no network or file I/O.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identified as benign, confidence 1, malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions, no external untrusted sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Produces dictionaries for database operations, no network or system commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, benign, confidence 1, malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions for Aerospike, with standard parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Creates operation dictionaries; no external or untrusted data processed maliciously.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of sys.version_info is for compatibility, not malicious purposes.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct assessment, high confidence, malware 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify the code as helper functions for constructing database operation dictionaries.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Logical Flaws:** No logical errors or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores align with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured helper module for Aerospike client operations, with no malicious or security concerns.",
