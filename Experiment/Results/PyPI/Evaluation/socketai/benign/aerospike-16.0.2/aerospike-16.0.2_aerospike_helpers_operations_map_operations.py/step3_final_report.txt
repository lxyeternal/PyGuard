  "purpose": "Helper functions to create map operation dictionaries for Aerospike client operations, including setting policies, creating maps, inserting, updating, removing, and querying map entries with support for nested CDT contexts.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as bin_name, policy, key, value, ctx, and other operation-specific arguments; no external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Constructed dictionaries used as arguments in aerospike.Client.operate or aerospike.Client.operate_ordered calls; no direct network, file, or system command execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions which assemble and return operation dictionaries; these are then used in database client calls to perform map operations.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, purpose-specific, and does not include dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of helper functions for building dictionaries representing map operations in Aerospike. It uses standard Python data structures, with optional context support. No external data sources, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are well-documented, purpose-specific, and do not perform any I/O or network activities. The code is clear, structured, and intended for internal API use, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for constructing Aerospike map operation commands. It poses no security or malicious risks, and all signals indicate safe, standard API helper functions.",
