  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides helper functions for Aerospike map operations, with no external or untrusted input sources explicitly present.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Constructs dictionaries for client operations; no direct system or network actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and solely creates data structures for database commands. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, legitimate helper functions with high confidence (0.95). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code is purely functional and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar helper functions for Aerospike, reading parameters from function arguments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Creates operation dictionaries for client API calls, no external data leaks or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Straightforward, standard helper functions, no secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clearly legitimate, with maximum confidence (1). No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions for Aerospike map operations, no untrusted input handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Builds dictionaries for client commands, no network or system calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is a typical API wrapper.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, benign, with high confidence (1). No malware.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; safe helper code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar helper functions, no handling of untrusted input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Creates operation dictionaries for client use.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, standard SDK helper code, high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; purely utility functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions for constructing Aerospike map operation dictionaries, with standard parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Produces dictionaries for client API calls, no external or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns. Use of sys.version_info is solely for compatibility.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, benign, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports. The code is clear, well-structured, and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible, close to 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nAll reports consistently indicate that the code is a set of helper functions for constructing database operation dictionaries for Aerospike, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior. The functions are standard, well-documented, and do not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to code injection, network leaks, or system compromise.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just a utility library)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and safe for use in production environments.",
