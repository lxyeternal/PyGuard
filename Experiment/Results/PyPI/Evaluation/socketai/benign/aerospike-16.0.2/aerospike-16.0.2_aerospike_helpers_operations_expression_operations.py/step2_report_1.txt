  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as helper functions that generate dictionaries for Aerospike expression read/write operations.\n- No reports mention any external data handling, network activity, or code execution beyond constructing data structures.\n- The code appears straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard APIs.\n- The expressions are compiled via an external module (`resources`), which is not shown but is assumed to be part of the SDK or trusted code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code itself does not contain any malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious logic.\n- The functions are purely utility wrappers for creating operation dictionaries.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws are apparent; the code is simple and well-structured.\n- The only minor note is that the functions accept expression objects that are compiled elsewhere, which relies on the correctness and safety of the external `resources` module. But this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature.\n- **Risk score:** Reports assign values between 0.1 and 0.2, which are low. Given the code's simplicity and safety, these seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The functions themselves do not perform any dangerous operations.\n- The only potential concern could be if untrusted expressions are compiled and executed elsewhere, but within this code, no such execution occurs.\n- The code depends on external modules (`resources`) for expressions, but assuming those are trusted, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- If the `resources` module or the expressions it compiles are malicious or untrusted, then the overall system could be at risk. However, this is outside the scope of the provided code snippet.\n- The code does not perform any validation on the expressions or flags, which could be a concern if misused, but not a direct security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 seems reasonable; I would suggest **0.1** as it is very low and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all factors, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to reliance on external expression compilation, but no direct risk here)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard helper module for Aerospike expression operations. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low risk score is justified, assuming the external `resources` module is trusted.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code appears safe and well-understood.",
