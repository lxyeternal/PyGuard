{
  "purpose": "Provide helper functions to create expression read and write operation dictionaries for use with Aerospike client operations, specifically for expressions and batch commands.",
  "sources": "Importing 'aerospike' module and 'resources' from 'aerospike_helpers.expressions'. No external inputs or user data read. No user input handling or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The functions generate dictionaries for Aerospike client operations that include expression objects. No data sinks that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (bin_name, expression, flags) are used to construct operation dictionaries. These are returned for later execution by the Aerospike client; no direct execution or data flow to external systems occurs within these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward, modular, with clear documentation. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for creating operation dictionaries involving expressions in Aerospike. It imports necessary modules and constructs dictionaries with specific keys and values, based on input parameters. No data is read from external sources at runtime, and no untrusted data is processed unsafely. The functions are well-documented, with examples demonstrating intended usage. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or data leaks are detected. The overall design appears safe and intended solely for facilitating Aerospike expression operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured helper module for Aerospike expression operations. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified. It appears to be a standard utility code with no evidence of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
