  "purpose": "Helper functions to create dictionaries for Aerospike expression read/write operations, facilitating client operations with compiled expressions.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'bin_name', 'expression', and optional flags; external 'resources' module providing compiled expressions.",
  "sinks": "None; functions only generate dictionaries, no data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are packaged into dictionaries; no data flow beyond dictionary creation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for constructing operation dictionaries for Aerospike expressions. It imports standard modules, accepts parameters, and returns well-structured dictionaries. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution occurs within these functions. The expressions are compiled externally, which is typical and not inherently risky. The functions do not evaluate or execute expressions, only package them. The code is well-documented, with examples, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of externally compiled expressions. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. The low risk score (~0.1) is justified given the utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard helper module for Aerospike expression operations. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward, safe design.",
