  "purpose": "Helper functions to create dictionaries for Aerospike expression read and write operations used in batch commands and expressions evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code imports aerospike module and resources from aerospike_helpers.expressions, which are used to compile expressions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks of untrusted data or external data transmission are present. The functions produce dictionaries based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (bin_name, expression, flags) are used to create dictionaries for aerospike operations; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for constructing expression operation dictionaries for the aerospike client. It imports necessary modules, defines constants, and contains two functions: expression_read and expression_write. Both functions accept parameters including bin names, expressions, and flags, and return dictionaries formatted for aerospike operation calls. The logic is simple, with no external data transmission, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a legitimate SDK or helper library intended for use in database operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate helper module for aerospike database operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply constructs dictionaries for expression-based read and write operations. No malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected.",
