  "purpose": "Helper functions to create operation dictionaries for Aerospike database client operations such as read, write, delete, append, prepend, increment, and touch.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (bin_name, write_item, append_item, prepend_item, amount, ttl) and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Operation dictionaries returned by functions, used in database commands.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into the functions, which generate dictionaries used in database operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a warning for deprecated TTL in 'touch' function; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing utility functions for building operation dictionaries for the Aerospike client. It uses standard patterns and includes a deprecation warning for the TTL parameter in the 'touch' function. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is observed. The functions are simple and do not perform any network operations, file handling, or system modifications. They rely on external libraries (aerospike) without embedding malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module designed for constructing database operation dictionaries. It contains no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate database interactions with safe, well-defined functions.",
