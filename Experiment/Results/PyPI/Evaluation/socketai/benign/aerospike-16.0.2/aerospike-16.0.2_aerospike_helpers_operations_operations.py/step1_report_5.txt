  "purpose": "Helper functions to create operation dictionaries for Aerospike client operations such as read, write, delete, append, prepend, increment, and touch.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (bin_name, write_item, append_item, prepend_item, amount, ttl). No external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The operation dictionaries created and returned by each function are used as inputs to Aerospike client operations, potentially affecting database state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, which generate dictionaries with operation codes and values. These dictionaries are then used in Aerospike client commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns. Use of warnings for deprecated TTL parameter is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for constructing operation dictionaries for Aerospike database operations. All functions are straightforward, converting input parameters into dictionaries with operation codes from the aerospike module. There are no external data reads, no network activity, or code execution mechanisms present. The only minor noteworthy aspect is the deprecation warning for TTL in the touch function, which is standard practice. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate helper functions for database operations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily constructs data structures used in Aerospike operations without any malicious side effects.",
