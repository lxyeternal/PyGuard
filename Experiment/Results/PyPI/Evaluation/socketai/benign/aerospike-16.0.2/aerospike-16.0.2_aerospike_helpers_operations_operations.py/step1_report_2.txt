{
  "purpose": "Helper functions to create dictionaries representing Aerospike database operations for reading, writing, deleting, appending, prepending, incrementing, and touching records.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as bin_name, write_item, append_item, prepend_item, amount, and optional ttl.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating operation dictionaries; no direct sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the functions, which then produce dictionaries representing operations; no further data flow or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; use of warnings.warn for deprecation notice is standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for creating operation dictionaries for Aerospike. It accepts input parameters and returns dictionaries with predefined keys and values based on the aerospike module's constants. There are no untrusted data sinks leading to code execution or data exfiltration. The only noteworthy feature is the deprecation warning for TTL, which is a common practice. The code appears clean, well-structured, and free of malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign helper module for constructing database operation dictionaries, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It is safe and functions as intended without security risks.",
