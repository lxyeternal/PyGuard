  "purpose": "Helper functions to create dictionaries for Aerospike database operations such as read, write, delete, append, prepend, increment, and touch.",
  "sources": "Function arguments such as 'bin_name', 'write_item', 'append_item', 'prepend_item', and 'amount'; imported modules 'aerospike' and 'warnings'.",
  "sinks": "The dictionaries created, which are passed to Aerospike client methods; no external untrusted data flows directly into system effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, generating operation dictionaries that are passed to the Aerospike client for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of warnings for deprecated TTL handling is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple helper functions for creating operation dictionaries for Aerospike database commands. Each function takes straightforward parameters and returns a dictionary with predefined operation types and associated values. No untrusted data is directly used in system calls, and no external network or system manipulation occurs. The use of warnings for deprecated TTL parameter is a standard practice. The code is well-structured, with clear argument handling, and does not include obfuscated code or malicious constructs. The only notable aspect is the use of a deprecated parameter with a warning, which is standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as utility functions for database operations and contains no malicious intent or security risks. It is clean, straightforward, and does not perform any harmful actions.",
