  "purpose": "Helper functions to create dictionaries for Aerospike database operations such as read, write, delete, append, prepend, increment, and touch.",
  "sources": "Function input parameters (bin_name, write_item, append_item, prepend_item, amount, ttl) used to generate operation dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Generated dictionaries used as arguments in Aerospike client operations; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, which produce dictionaries with predefined keys and values for database commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn for deprecated TTL parameter in 'touch' function; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions that generate operation dictionaries for Aerospike client calls. No external data processing, code execution, or network activity occurs. The functions are simple, with clear parameters and outputs. The only noteworthy aspect is the deprecation warning in 'touch', which is standard and benign. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of helper functions for constructing Aerospike operation dictionaries. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The deprecation warning is standard and does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe for use in production environments.",
