  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flow, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Helper functions for constructing list operation dictionaries for Aerospike.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Straightforward parameter-to-dictionary construction; no external data or code execution.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Analysis: The code is benign, serving as a utility for database operations.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks detected.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar helper functions for list operations.\n- Data flow: Clear, parameter-based dictionary creation.\n- Anomalies: No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Legitimate SDK utility code, safe and straightforward.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Again, helper functions for list manipulations.\n- Data flow: Consistent, parameter-driven.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, no external network or code execution.\n- Analysis: Standard SDK helper functions.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, list operation helpers.\n- Data flow: Clear, with no external or untrusted data execution.\n- Anomalies: No signs of malicious activity.\n- Analysis: Legitimate, well-structured code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign utility functions.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Helper functions for list operations.\n- Data flow: Parameters used to build operation dictionaries.\n- Anomalies: No malicious code, no obfuscation, no external network activity.\n- Analysis: Clean utility code, no signs of malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: No security risk.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports describe helper functions that construct operation dictionaries for Aerospike list manipulations. The code is straightforward, parameter-driven, and aligns with standard SDK utility patterns. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, external data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, intended as a utility module for database list operations, with no malicious or security concerns.**",
