  "purpose": "Build configuration and setup script for a Python C extension, managing environment variables, platform detection, and build commands.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., AEROSPIKE_C_VERSION, STATIC_SSL, SSL_LIB_PATH), platform detection, configuration files, and file paths for build dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls ('make', 'msbuild', 'dsymutil') for building, cleaning, and debugging; environment variable modifications for compiler and linker flags.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands and build flags; platform detection determines build steps and paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; standard build process with typical environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive, standard build setup for a Python extension with C components, handling cross-platform differences and build dependencies. It executes external build tools and modifies environment variables as part of the build process. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code is present. The subprocess calls and environment manipulations are typical for build scripts. The reliance on environment variables poses a minimal external manipulation risk but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is transparent, well-structured, and aligns with common build practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard build configuration script for a Python C extension, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The slight risk score reflects potential external environment manipulation but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
