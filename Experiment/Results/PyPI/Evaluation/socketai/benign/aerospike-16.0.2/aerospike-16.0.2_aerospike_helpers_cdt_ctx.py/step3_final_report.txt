{
  "purpose": "Helper functions and class to generate nested collection data type context objects (cdt_ctx) for use with Aerospike operations, facilitating access and modification of nested lists and maps.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (indices, keys, values), constants, and Aerospike module enums (e.g., aerospike.INDEX_TYPE_LIST).",
  "sinks": "The created context objects are used in database operations such as 'operate' and 'info' commands, influencing data retrieval and modification within nested collections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (indices, keys, values) are converted into _cdt_ctx instances, which are then used as context in database operations, guiding nested data access.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward, with clear documentation and no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for creating context objects for nested collection operations in Aerospike. It converts enum values to strings, constructs context objects for list and map indices, ranks, keys, values, and creation contexts, and encapsulates them in the _cdt_ctx class. The functions operate solely on input parameters and constants, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The purpose is to facilitate safe, structured access to nested data. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code is a standard SDK helper module, benign in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-oriented helper library for nested collection context creation in Aerospike. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is very low (around 0.1), reflecting its utility nature and minimal potential for misuse. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use.",
