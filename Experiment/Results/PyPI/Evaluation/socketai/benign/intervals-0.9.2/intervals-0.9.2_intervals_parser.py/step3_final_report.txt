{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes for parsing interval strings and objects, facilitating interval representation and validation.",
  "sources": "String inputs in parse_string, parse_hyphen_range, parse_bounded_range methods; object attributes in parse_object; sequence inputs in parse_sequence; direct value inputs in parse_single_value.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal data processing only, with exception handling for invalid formats.",
  "flows": "Input strings or objects flow through parsing methods, converting to interval representations, with exception handling for malformed inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; handling of negative numbers and edge cases is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward interval parser with no network, file, or system calls. It performs string manipulations, exception handling, and data structure conversions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The parsing logic carefully handles various interval formats, including bounded ranges and hyphen ranges, with validation and exception raising for invalid formats. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The absence of external interactions and malicious patterns indicates a benign utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard interval parsing utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.2). The assessments in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
