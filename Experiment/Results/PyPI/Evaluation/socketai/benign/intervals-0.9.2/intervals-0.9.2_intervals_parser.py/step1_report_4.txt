{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for parsing string representations of intervals and bounds, likely for use in range queries or similar operations.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily read from string parameters passed to methods such as parse_string and parse_object.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident; no data is sent over network, written to files, or executed.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into structured interval bounds; data flows from input strings through parsing functions into internal representations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses straightforward parsing logic. The only notable point is handling of hyphen ranges, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: IntervalStringParser and IntervalParser. The first parses string representations of intervals, including bounded ranges and hyphen ranges, into list structures with flags. The second converts interval bounds or sequence objects into a standard tuple format indicating lower and upper bounds and inclusion flags. The code uses standard string manipulation and exception handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be utility functions for interval parsing, with no network or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for parsing interval strings and objects. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The parsing logic is straightforward and does not involve executing or evaluating untrusted code beyond string parsing.",
