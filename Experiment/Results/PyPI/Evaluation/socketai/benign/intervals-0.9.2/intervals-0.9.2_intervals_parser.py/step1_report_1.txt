{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for parsing interval strings and objects, likely for use in range or interval calculations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the parameter 'value' in parse_string and parse_hyphen_range methods, as well as 'obj' and 'seq' in parse_object and parse_sequence methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls are present. The code primarily manipulates strings and data structures.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into lower and upper bounds, which are then processed into structured interval representations; however, no external output or insecure operations are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution. It relies on standard parsing logic. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines parsing classes for interval strings and objects. The methods perform string manipulations and data structure conversions. No network, file, or system interaction exists. The only potential concern is the handling of input strings, but it is confined to string parsing with exception handling for invalid formats. No security-sensitive operations, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious commands, are present. The code does not execute untrusted code or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for interval parsing without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It contains no malware or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
