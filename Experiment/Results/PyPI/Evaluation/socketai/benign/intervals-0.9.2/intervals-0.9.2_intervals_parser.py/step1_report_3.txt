{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for parsing interval strings and objects, likely used for range validation or manipulation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from method parameters such as 'value' in parse_string, parse_bounded_range, parse_hyphen_range, and 'obj' in parse_object, as well as 'seq' in parse_sequence.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily processes data internally; no direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present. No untrusted data is sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input from method parameters is parsed and processed to produce structured interval representations; no external data flows or suspicious transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code performs standard parsing operations with exception handling for specific input formats.",
  "analysis": "The code defines parsing classes for interval strings and objects, handling various formats such as hyphen ranges and bounded ranges. It includes careful handling of edge cases, such as negative ranges or malformed input, raising exceptions when necessary. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign parsing utility for interval ranges with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with proper input validation and error handling. No malicious intent or malicious code elements are detected.",
