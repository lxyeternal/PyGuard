{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of utility classes for parsing interval strings and objects, likely used in range-based operations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as 'value' in 'parse_string', 'obj' in 'parse_object', and 'seq' in 'parse_sequence'. These are external inputs passed to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send untrusted data to network, files, or other systems; it primarily processes input data locally and returns parsed results. No data leakage points or dangerous sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into list or tuple representations, then possibly reconstructed or used internally; no direct flows to external systems or sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a custom exception class import and handling of interval formats. The parsing logic includes handling for negative numbers and various interval formats, which seem standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for parsing interval strings and objects, converting them into structured range representations. It performs standard string operations, splitting, and type checks. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. It appears to be a normal utility module for range parsing. The only notable behavior is exception raising on unknown formats, which is typical for robust parsers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward parser for interval representations with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, hidden network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The security risk is minimal, and the likelihood of malicious use is very low.",
