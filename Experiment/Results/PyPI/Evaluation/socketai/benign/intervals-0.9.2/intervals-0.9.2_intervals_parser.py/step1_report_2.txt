{
  "purpose": "The code provides parsing utilities for interval strings and objects, likely used for handling range-based data inputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from string parameters in 'parse_string', 'parse_hyphen_range', and 'parse_object' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs parsed interval data, but no sinks or data destinations are explicitly shown. No untrusted data is directly written or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input strings from 'parse_string' flow into 'parse_hyphen_range' or 'parse_bounded_range', then produce interval bounds. Parsed objects from 'parse_object' flow into output values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious backdoors observed. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The use of exceptions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly parses interval strings and object bounds, with proper handling of hyphen ranges and bounded ranges. No external data fetching, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No signs of malicious code or sabotage. The code appears to serve as a utility for interval parsing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard parsing utility for interval data. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is a straightforward, well-structured parser without security risks.",
