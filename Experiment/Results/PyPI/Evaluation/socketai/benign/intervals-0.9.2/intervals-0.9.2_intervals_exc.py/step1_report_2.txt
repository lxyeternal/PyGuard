  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for interval and argument validation errors.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are read; all data comes from class instantiations and internal code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. Exception messages are straightforward and contain no sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with specific messages for argument validation and range errors. All classes are straightforward and do not perform any data processing, I/O, or network operations. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes used for validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
