  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling interval-related errors",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading in this code)",
  "targets": "None (no data sinks or external interactions)",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception classes with no embedded malicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception class. The classes include specific exception types for interval errors, such as range bounds and argument issues. The constructor implementations are straightforward, formatting messages with input parameters. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears standard and focused on error handling without any signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines custom exception classes for interval-related errors with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a standard implementation for error handling, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
