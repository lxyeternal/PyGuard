  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling interval-related errors in Python.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; solely exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of super() calls with potentially incorrect class references; for example, super(IntervalException, self).__init__() inside subclasses that inherit from IntervalException, which may cause errors but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes custom exception classes for interval validation errors, including RangeBoundsException, IllegalArgument, and ValueCoercionException. The class RangeBoundsException constructs an error message indicating invalid min/max range, while other classes allow customizable messages. There are no input sources, no data sinks, and no external data handling. The use of super() with explicit class references appears inconsistent but does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code is straightforward class inheritance with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes related to interval errors, with no malicious behavior, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities detected. The main concern is a possible inconsistency in super() calls, which does not impact security.",
