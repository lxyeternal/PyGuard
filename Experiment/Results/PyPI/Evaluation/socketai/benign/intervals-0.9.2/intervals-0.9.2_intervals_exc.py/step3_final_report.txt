  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for interval-related errors, enabling specific error handling.",
  "sources": "Class constructors receiving parameters for message formatting; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception instantiation with formatted messages, no external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Inconsistent use of super() calls, e.g., super(IntervalException, self).__init__(), which may cause runtime errors but not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes with straightforward constructors. The main concern is the improper use of super() in subclasses, which could lead to incorrect exception chaining or runtime errors. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a benign purpose. The super() misuse is a bug rather than malicious behavior, and does not impact security. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily a bug risk rather than a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception classes with a minor bug in super() usage. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk due to the super() issue, which is a coding bug, not a security flaw.",
