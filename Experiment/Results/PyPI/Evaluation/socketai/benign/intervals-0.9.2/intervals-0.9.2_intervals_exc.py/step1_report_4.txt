  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for interval-related errors, including range bounds, illegal arguments, and value coercion issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; the code does not perform any data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output flows, or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The use of super(IntervalException, self).__init__(...) in the __init__ methods is unconventional; it appears to be a mistake, as it should likely call super(RangeBoundsException, self).__init__(...) and similar for other classes. This might lead to incorrect exception chaining but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions related to interval operations, with specific classes for range bounds, illegal arguments, and value coercion errors. Each class inherits from a base IntervalException class. The __init__ methods correctly format exception messages, although some use super() in a manner that might prevent proper exception chaining, which is a possible bug but not malicious. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows that could be exploited maliciously. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines exception classes with no external interactions or malicious logic. The unconventional use of super() in the __init__ methods appears to be an error rather than malicious behavior. Overall, there is no malware or security risk present.",
