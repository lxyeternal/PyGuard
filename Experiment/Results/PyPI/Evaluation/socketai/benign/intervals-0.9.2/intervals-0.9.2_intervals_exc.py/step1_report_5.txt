{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling interval-related errors and invalid argument scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where data could leak or cause effects are present; this code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code, as it only contains class definitions and no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with specific messages for invalid interval bounds and argument errors. The class constructors initialize the exceptions with descriptive messages, some of which format input parameters. There are no external data reads, no data manipulation, and no executable code beyond class definitions. The code appears to serve as a part of a larger validation or error handling framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, benign set of exception class definitions for interval and argument validation errors. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for custom exceptions without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
