  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception classes with a minor bug in super() usage. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk due to the super() issue, which is a coding bug, not a security flaw."
