{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of classes and functions for creating, manipulating, and evaluating mathematical intervals across various data types such as integers, floats, decimals, dates, and characters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from constructor parameters such as bounds, string representations via from_string(), and coercion from various types and strings. It also parses string representations of intervals.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include coercion functions that convert inputs to specific data types (int, float, Decimal, date, str). The code performs arithmetic operations and comparisons that could process untrusted input if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Input data (bounds, strings, objects) flow through coercion and parsing functions, then into interval objects. These objects perform comparisons, arithmetic, and set operations which could be influenced by untrusted data. However, there are no network, file, or system command executions involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials or secrets, nor does it include suspicious functions such as network communication, file modification, or system commands. All data manipulations are limited to mathematical and logical operations. The presence of 'infinity' imports and the handling of infinite bounds is standard in interval arithmetic. No obfuscation or misleading variable names are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code carefully implements interval arithmetic with various data types, including coercion, canonicalization, and set operations. The use of custom exceptions and type handling is standard. No evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, remote communication, or sabotage is present. The use of 'operator' for comparison and set logic is normal. The parsing and string conversion are standard. Overall, the code appears to be a well-structured library for interval calculations without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical mathematical interval library designed for safe interval operations across multiple data types. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It performs data coercion, interval arithmetic, and set operations securely. There are no signals of malware or malicious intent.",
