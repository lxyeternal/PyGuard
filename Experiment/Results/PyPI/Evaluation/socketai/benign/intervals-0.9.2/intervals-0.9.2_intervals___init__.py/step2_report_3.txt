  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and exceptions from local modules, defining `__all__`, and setting a version string. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module definition for a Python package.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is simple, non-malicious, and free of suspicious patterns. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0  \n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's nature. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or obfuscated.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports conclude no malicious activity, the risk scores are justified at 0. The code is purely structural, serving as an API surface, with no indication of security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not include any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and do not assume vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond what the code demonstrates. They are consistent and based on observable code structure.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\nGiven the simplicity and transparency of the code, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard module setup for an interval management library, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, well-structured, and typical for a Python package's API definition. No further security concerns are warranted.",
