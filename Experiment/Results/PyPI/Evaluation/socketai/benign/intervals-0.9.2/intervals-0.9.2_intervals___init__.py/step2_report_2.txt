  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and exceptions from local modules and defining `__all__` and `__version__`. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a typical Python module initialization file, with no signs of malicious behavior. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The obfuscated score is also 0, which is appropriate. The confidence level is 1 across all reports, indicating certainty. These scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely for module setup, with no data processing, no external interactions, and no suspicious patterns, higher risk scores are unwarranted. The current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the actual code content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (or very close to zero, as the code is benign but assigned a minimal default risk)  \n\n**Overall Justification**:  \nThe code is a standard Python module initializer for an interval management library. It imports classes and functions, sets up `__all__`, and defines a version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores reflect this.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- No issues detected.  \n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.  \n- The code is benign and safe.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current low-risk assessment, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal risk score.",
