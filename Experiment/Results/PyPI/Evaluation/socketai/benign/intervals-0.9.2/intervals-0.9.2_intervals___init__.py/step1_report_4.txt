{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python library for handling various types of intervals, such as date, time, decimal, float, and integer intervals.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.exc and .interval) which likely contain class and function definitions; no external data sources or user input read directly.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no output, network, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "Data and class/function definitions flow internally within the module; no source-to-sink data flow indicative of malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs. The code structure is typical for a module's __init__.py file setting up exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from sibling modules (.exc and .interval) and defines __all__ for exports. It also sets a version string. The code is straightforward, intended for modular package setup, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behaviors observed. The absence of network, file, or environment manipulations reduces risk. The code is clean and typical of a Python package's initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply exports classes and functions for external use, with no suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
