{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export interval-related classes and exceptions for a Python package related to interval arithmetic or range management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.exc and .interval) and the assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flow targets; no untrusted data handling or external communications",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only module imports and a version assignment",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code strictly defines imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and exceptions from local modules, then declares a __all__ list for module exports, and finally assigns a version string. There are no functions, network operations, environment variable accesses, or dynamic code executions. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, designed to define the public API.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard module setup code for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It simply organizes and exports classes and exceptions related to interval management.",
