  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and exceptions related to interval management, sets `__all__`, and defines a version.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk assessment:** No security risk, malware, or obfuscation. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. The code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the module's role as an API surface for interval classes and exceptions.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external interactions.\n- **Risk assessment:** No security issues, malware, or obfuscation. Confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is standard module setup.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines and exports interval classes and exceptions, with no dynamic behavior.\n- **Findings:** No external data processing, no network I/O, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk assessment:** No security risks, malware, or obfuscation. Confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The code is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or similar.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up exports for interval classes, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No external data handling, no obfuscation, no dynamic code.\n- **Risk assessment:** No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. Confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. The code is a standard module initialization.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, focusing on defining and exporting interval classes and exceptions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no external interactions, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk assessment:** No security risks, malware, or obfuscation. Confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports agree that the code is a simple module that imports specific classes and exceptions, defines `__all__`, and sets a version string.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected in any report or in the code itself.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent; the code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or access environment variables.\n- **Logical flaws:** None identified; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**    | 0                 | No malicious behavior or code observed.                                       |\n| **Obfuscated** | 0                 | Clear, standard import and export pattern, no obfuscation.                   |\n| **Risk**       | 0                 | No security risks or vulnerabilities identified in this setup code.        |\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of this code—primarily imports and exports—it is expected that the scores remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a typical, benign module setup for an interval management library. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The reports are consistent, and the overall assessment aligns with the code's straightforward nature.",
