{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a library that defines various interval classes and exceptions for interval management, likely used for handling different types of ranges such as dates, numbers, characters, etc.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.exc and .interval), defining __all__, and setting __version__",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted input or output to external systems observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports and defines module exports, with no data processing or flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code structure and naming are typical for a Python library module",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions related to interval management from local modules, sets up the module's public API via __all__, and specifies a version number. There are no functions, data processing, user input handling, or network operations. The structure is straightforward and consistent with standard Python module setup. No anomalies, malicious code, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for an interval management library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely imports and exports classes and exceptions, and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
