{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package defining interval classes and related exceptions, likely used for range or interval calculations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.exc and .interval), possibly reading exception definitions and interval class implementations.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sink points; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; the code mainly imports and exposes classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__, serving as an API interface. It does not execute dynamic code, access environment variables, or include external system calls. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The structure and content are typical for a library module that organizes and exposes functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module for a Python package managing interval-related classes and exceptions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
