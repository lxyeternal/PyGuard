{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing various interval classes and exceptions, defining the public API via __all__, and setting a version string for an interval management library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local modules (.exc and .interval) during import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external input or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve importing classes and exceptions from local modules, then exposing them via __all__, with no dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup that imports specific classes and exceptions, defines __all__ for public API exposure, and sets a version string. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The structure is typical for a Python package's initialization file, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for an interval management library. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
