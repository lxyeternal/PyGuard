{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and export a set of interval-related classes, functions, and exceptions for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.exc and .interval), and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the module only exports classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures detected. The __version__ string is a standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and re-exports them in __all__, which controls the module's public API. The version string is set to '0.9.2'. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or handling of untrusted input. The structure is straightforward and typical of a Python package's __init__.py or module definition. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a module initializer or API surface definition for an interval handling library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks identified.",
