{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases for interval classes with step functionality, specifically for integers, floats, and decimals.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, instantiates objects, and accesses their attributes during assertions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is being outputted or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input sources (class instantiation and attribute access) flow into assertions; no external data flow or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of test classes and methods verifying interval calculations. It uses only standard libraries and imported interval classes. No external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be for testing mathematical interval behaviors. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The absence of external side effects or data leaks indicates no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of test cases for interval classes. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is safe and intended for validation purposes.",
