{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases for interval classes (IntInterval, FloatInterval, DecimalInterval) with steps, verifying their properties and rounding behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded numeric values and parameters passed to class constructors, such as interval bounds and step sizes.",
  "targets": "Assertions check computed lower and upper bounds, and interval properties; no external data or untrusted input sources are used.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (numeric bounds and steps) are processed by interval class constructors, and assertions verify the resulting interval properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or hidden actions detected; all operations are standard interval calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code solely tests interval classes for correct step calculations and rounding. It uses fixed numeric values (including Decimals) and assertions to validate expected behavior. There are no input/output operations, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no signs of malicious logic. The code appears purely for testing interval logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for interval classes, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It performs standard calculations and assertions to verify correct behavior.",
