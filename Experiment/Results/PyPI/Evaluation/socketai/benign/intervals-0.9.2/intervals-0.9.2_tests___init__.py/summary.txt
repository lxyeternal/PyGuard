  "conclusion": "The provided scores are consistent with the analysis. Reports 1, 2, and 5 are benign with zero malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3's dynamic code features justify a moderate malware score (~0.2-0.3). Report 4's obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify high malware (~0.6) and obfuscated (~0.8) scores. Overall, the security risk scores appropriately reflect the suspicion levels. No significant adjustments are necessary."
