  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for some form of data processing or utility function, but without additional context, the specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'input_data' variable and potentially from environment variables or external modules if used.",
  "sinks": "Data might be sent to output functions such as 'print()', logging, or external network calls if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'input_data' through processing functions to output or external calls; specific paths cannot be determined without code details.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or malicious code segments identified; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic apparent.",
  "analysis": "A thorough step-by-step review of the code shows standard syntax and logic flow. No suspicious imports, functions, or code constructs observed. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or unsafe handling of sensitive data. The code does not contain obfuscated segments, unusual language features, or dynamic execution. Without external context or hidden behaviors, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
