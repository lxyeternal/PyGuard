  "purpose": "Analysis of Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading from environment variables, input files, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), obfuscated strings, dynamic imports.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage via network or files, dynamic code execution paths, suspicious string usage.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input to eval/exec or network connections; dynamic imports leading to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, suspicious strings, convoluted code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1, 2, and 5, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation. Report 3 shows dynamic code execution (eval/exec) but no confirmed malicious payload, leading to a moderate malware score. Report 4 demonstrates obfuscation, convoluted variable names, dynamic imports, and suspicious strings, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. The scores align with the described suspiciousness levels, with benign code receiving low scores and obfuscated/dynamically executed code receiving higher scores. The overall suspicion is moderate, primarily driven by reports 3 and 4.",
  "conclusion": "The provided scores are consistent with the analysis. Reports 1, 2, and 5 are benign with zero malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3's dynamic code features justify a moderate malware score (~0.2-0.3). Report 4's obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify high malware (~0.6) and obfuscated (~0.8) scores. Overall, the security risk scores appropriately reflect the suspicion levels. No significant adjustments are necessary.",
