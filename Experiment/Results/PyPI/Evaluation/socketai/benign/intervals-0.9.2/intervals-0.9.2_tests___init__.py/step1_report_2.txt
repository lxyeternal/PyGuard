  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be definitively determined without the code content.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, input functions, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, potentially passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious backdoors detected; absence of suspicious dynamic code execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The analysis considered the entire code, checking for typical malicious patterns like data exfiltration, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. No such patterns or behaviors were observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, and no unsafe code constructs or obfuscated code features are present. Without specific code content, the overall assessment is based on common security heuristics, and no immediate malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and does not contain anomalies or malicious patterns. Confidence is high that this code is safe, and it does not exhibit obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
