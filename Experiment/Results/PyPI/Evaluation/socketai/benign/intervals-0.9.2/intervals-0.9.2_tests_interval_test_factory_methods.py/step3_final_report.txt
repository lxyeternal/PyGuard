  "purpose": "Unit tests for the IntInterval class factory methods and properties.",
  "sources": "Method calls to IntInterval class methods, input parameters within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into factory methods; no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying IntInterval factory methods and properties. It imports from benign, well-known open-source modules ('infinity' and 'intervals') and performs no external data handling, network communication, or malicious actions. The assertions confirm expected behavior, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code's structure and content indicate a benign purpose, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of unit tests with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The supply chain security risk is negligible.",
