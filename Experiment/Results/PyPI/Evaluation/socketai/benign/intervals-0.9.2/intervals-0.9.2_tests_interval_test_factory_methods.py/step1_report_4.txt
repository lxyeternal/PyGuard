  "purpose": "Unit tests for the IntInterval class methods, verifying correct behavior of interval creation functions.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external communications.",
  "flows": "This code only creates and asserts properties of interval objects; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class with methods that instantiate IntInterval objects using various factory methods. Each test checks the properties of the created interval, such as bounds, inclusivity, and step. The code relies solely on class methods and assertions, with no input/output or external dependencies. The imports are standard and from open-source libraries, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of unit tests for the IntInterval class, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted data. The code is clean, structured, and purpose-specific.",
