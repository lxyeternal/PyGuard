  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "eval/exec statements, hardcoded URLs/credentials, environment variables, input parameters, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network communication, file I/O, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or hardcoded secrets leading to system commands, network requests, or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated strings, use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs/credentials, encrypted payloads, indirect data flows, suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in some reports, notably Reports 1 and 4, which include eval/exec and obfuscated variables. These patterns increase suspicion but do not confirm malicious activity. Reports 2, 3, and 5 show straightforward, benign code with no suspicious features. The scores assigned—obfuscation around 0.4-0.6 and malware suspicion around 0.3-0.4—are justified based on the presence of obfuscation and dynamic code features. The security risk scores reflect the suspicion levels, with moderate concern in Reports 1 and 4. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution in certain reports. Scores are appropriately conservative, aligning with the evidence. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but caution is warranted for reports with higher obfuscation and dynamic features.",
