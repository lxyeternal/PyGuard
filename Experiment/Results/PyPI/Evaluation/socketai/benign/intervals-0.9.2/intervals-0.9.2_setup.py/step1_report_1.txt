  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'intervals' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__init__.py' file for version information, and static setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily defines package metadata and dependencies, with no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; standard setup script with version extraction.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading version info from a file, defining dependencies, and configuring metadata. No user input, network connections, or sensitive data handling occurs. The version is obtained via regex from a file, which is standard. No obfuscation, code execution, or suspicious behavior identified. Usage of third-party dependencies is standard, with no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup configuration for the Python package 'intervals'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
