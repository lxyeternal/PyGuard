  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'intervals' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the contents of '__init__.py' to extract version information; reads package metadata; no untrusted input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard setup functions to install dependencies and package metadata; no sinks involving untrusted data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from package files; flows into setup configuration for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic present. No unusual or obfuscated code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package. It reads version information from a package file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for packaging. All operations involve reading static files or setting package attributes without executing untrusted code or performing external actions. No malware indicators or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
