{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging the 'intervals' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable from 'intervals/__init__.py'; reads the entire file content for version extraction; references static metadata for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted data sinks; no external inputs are processed dynamically; no network or file operations beyond static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file; uses static strings for package metadata; no untrusted data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code follows standard setup script practices without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for Python packaging. It reads the package version from a file, sets dependencies, and defines package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. All operations are static and intended for package setup. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python library. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any malicious intent or security risks.",
