{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging the 'intervals' Python library, performing static configuration without dynamic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'intervals/__init__.py' via regex; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs processed.",
  "flows": "Static reading of version info; no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration. It reads static data, defines dependencies, and sets package metadata without any dynamic code, network activity, or user input. All reports correctly identify it as safe, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The regex-based version extraction is standard and safe. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code aligns with common packaging practices and poses no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
