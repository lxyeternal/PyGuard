{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'intervals' Python library, facilitating installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from __init__.py to extract version information; reads static strings and package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data inputs or outputs are present in this script.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script primarily reads static files and data for setup purposes without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The version extraction uses regex but in a safe, standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py for a Python package, importing setup from setuptools and defining package metadata. The get_version() function reads the package's __init__.py to extract the __version__ string using a regex pattern. All other code involves static data for package configuration. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. The code follows common packaging conventions and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign setup script used for packaging a Python library. No malicious or security-related issues are present. The code does not pose any supply chain risks or security threats.",
