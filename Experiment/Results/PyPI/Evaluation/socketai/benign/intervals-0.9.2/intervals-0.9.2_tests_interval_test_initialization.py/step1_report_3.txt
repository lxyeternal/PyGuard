  "purpose": "Unit testing for interval classes including FloatInterval, DecimalInterval, IntInterval, CharacterInterval, and their string parsing and validation logic.",
  "sources": "Imports of data types (date, Decimal, inf), usage of pytest for testing, and various interval constructors and parameterizations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data streams; all data used appears to be controlled within tests or standard library functions.",
  "flows": "The tests create interval objects from literals or strings, validate properties, and raise exceptions for invalid inputs; no untrusted data flows into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code performs standard unit testing functions. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for interval classes, verifying constructor behavior, string parsing, and type inference. Usage of 'raises' and parameterized tests aligns with typical testing practices. No code executes untrusted input or interacts with external systems. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. All code relies on standard Python modules and libraries with controlled data, focused on validation and exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for interval classes with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not process untrusted input in a harmful way nor contains malware or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
