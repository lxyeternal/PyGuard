  "purpose": "Dynamically imports and instantiates a reader class based on configuration data, mapping known backend identifiers to class paths.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary 'settings_dict' containing the 'backend' key within a nested structure.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module() and getattr() functions where untrusted input could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Configuration 'backend' value -> module path extraction -> importlib.import_module() -> getattr() -> class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import without validation or whitelisting, potential fallback to deprecated import style, warnings about old fashion import.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on runtime import of modules and classes based on configuration data, which can be manipulated if untrusted. Error handling is present for import and attribute errors. The pattern is inherently risky if inputs are not validated, as it could lead to remote code execution. No malicious payloads are embedded, but the dynamic import pattern is a security concern. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The main risk stems from unvalidated 'backend' values, which could be exploited if an attacker controls the configuration. The existing reports correctly identify this risk, assigning low malware scores (0) and moderate to high security risk scores (~0.6). Input validation or whitelisting would mitigate this risk effectively.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern enables flexible dynamic loading but introduces significant security risk if configuration inputs are untrusted. No malicious code is present, but the potential for exploitation exists. Proper validation or whitelisting should be implemented to reduce the security threat.",
