  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads and retrieves classes for different dynamic settings backends based on configuration data.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from the settings_dict parameter, particularly from SPECIAL_SETTINGS_KEY and DYNAMIC_SETTINGS_KEY keys.",
  "sinks": "Dynamically imports modules and retrieves classes using importlib.import_module and getattr, which could be manipulated if input is malicious.",
  "flows": "Source (settings_dict input) -> get_dynamic_reader() extracts backend path -> get_dynamic_reader_class() imports module and retrieves class -> potentially executes untrusted code if inputs are malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import with user-controlled data poses a risk; no input validation on 'backend' values. Warning about fallback to deprecated import method indicates potential for incorrect module resolution. No explicit security controls or sandboxing are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration data specifying module paths and class names for dynamic import. It maps known backend identifiers to class paths, then imports the module and fetches the class. If the class is not found or the import fails, it raises a custom exception. The fallback mechanism attempts to handle older formatting but may execute code based on external input without validation. Use of importlib.import_module and getattr on potentially untrusted input is a security concern. No sanitization, validation, or sandboxing measures are present. Overall, the code executes dynamic imports based on configuration data which could be manipulated to load malicious modules or execute arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs dynamic module import and class retrieval based on configuration data, which introduces security risks if inputs are untrusted or malicious. No input validation or security controls are implemented, making it potentially vulnerable to supply chain attacks or malicious code execution.",
