  "purpose": "A configuration loader class that manages settings from files, environment variables, command-line arguments, and supports dynamic updates.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line args), os.environ (environment variables), settings files via strategies, dynamic_reader.get()",
  "sinks": "self._dict (settings storage), dynamic_reader.set()",
  "flows": "Sources (cmd/env/files) -> _settings_list or dynamic_reader -> _dict",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration management class, loading settings from multiple sources with error handling and dynamic update capabilities. It relies on external modules for strategies and dynamic reading, which are not shown but are standard in such systems. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dynamic features could be exploited if external modules are malicious, but within this code snippet, no malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are justified based on external dependencies and dynamic features, which could pose risks if compromised, but no direct malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk stems from reliance on external modules and dynamic features, which are common in such systems but should be verified separately. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
