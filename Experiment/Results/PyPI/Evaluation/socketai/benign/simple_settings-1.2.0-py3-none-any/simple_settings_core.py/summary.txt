  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight security risk stems from reliance on external modules and dynamic features, which are common in such systems but should be verified separately. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate."
