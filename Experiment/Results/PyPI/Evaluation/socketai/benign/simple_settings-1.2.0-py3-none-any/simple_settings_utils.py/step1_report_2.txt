  "purpose": "Provide a context manager and decorator for temporarily modifying application settings during tests.",
  "sources": "Imports from functools and a local module .core; the class SettingsStub which modifies settings",
  "sinks": "settings.configure and settings.as_dict methods, which may manipulate or expose configuration data",
  "flows": "Constructor stores new settings, __enter__ calls settings.setup and settings.configure, __exit__ restores previous settings",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of settings methods appears standard for test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility class for testing purposes, allowing temporary changes to application settings in a safe manner. It uses context management and decorators to ensure settings are restored after tests. The usage of settings.setup, settings.configure, and settings.as_dict appears normal. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious actions are evident. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard testing utility for managing configuration states, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
