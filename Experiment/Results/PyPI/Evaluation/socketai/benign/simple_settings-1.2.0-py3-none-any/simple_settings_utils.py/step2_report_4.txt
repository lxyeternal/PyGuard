  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; no anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior, just a testing utility.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code aligns with the description; no anomalies or malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** Utility for tests, no security concern.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; consistent with benign testing utility.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Matches the code; no anomalies or malicious indicators.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — consistent.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) perhaps due to the use of `settings.configure()` which modifies global state, but this is standard for testing utilities.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.1 — acceptable, given the context.  \n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), which is reasonable considering the potential for misconfiguration in real-world scenarios, but overall safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly indicate 0.0, as there's no malicious activity or code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 across all reports; code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Risk score:** All are 0.0 except report 5, which is 0.1, reflecting a minimal concern about global state modification during tests.\n\n**Overall, the scores are consistent with the code and analysis.**  \nThe code is a standard, safe testing utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:  \n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 — very low; the only minor concern is the global state change, which is typical in testing utilities.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and intended solely for testing purposes. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
