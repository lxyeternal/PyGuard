{
  "purpose": "Import LazySettings and settings from the local core module, likely for configuration management.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .core module within the package.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output is visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a standard import statement with a linter directive. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement bringing in two objects from a relative module named core. The presence of '# noqa' suggests suppression of linter warnings, which is common for local imports. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The module imported may be part of a configuration system, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is simple, benign, and appears to serve a configuration or settings purpose without any suspicious activity.",
