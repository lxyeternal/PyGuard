  "purpose": "Import LazySettings and settings from the core module, likely for configuration management.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .core module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; only imports are involved.",
  "flows": "Import flow from the local core module to possibly use configuration objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific objects (LazySettings and settings) from a local module named core. There are no functions, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. It does not contain any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The import seems standard for configuration purposes in a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for configuration classes or objects. It presents no malicious behavior, no security issues, and appears to be part of normal application setup.",
