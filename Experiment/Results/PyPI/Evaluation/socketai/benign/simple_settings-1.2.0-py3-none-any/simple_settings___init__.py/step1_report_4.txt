  "purpose": "Import LazySettings and settings from the local core module, likely for configuration management.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a relative module '.core', which is a local file/module in the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; the code simply imports objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a relative module, which is typical in Python projects. It does not include any data handling, user input, or network interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. Since it is only an import statement, there is no apparent security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving only to import configuration-related objects from a local module. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
