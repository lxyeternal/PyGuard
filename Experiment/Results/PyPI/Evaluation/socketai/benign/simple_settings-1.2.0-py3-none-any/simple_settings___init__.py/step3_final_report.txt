  "purpose": "Import configuration objects LazySettings and settings from a local module named core.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; standard import from local module",
  "flows": "Import statement itself; no data flow beyond module import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import with no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, syntactically correct import statement importing LazySettings and settings from a local module core. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The # noqa comment is standard for suppressing linter warnings. The code does not involve data flows, external network activity, or processing logic. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
