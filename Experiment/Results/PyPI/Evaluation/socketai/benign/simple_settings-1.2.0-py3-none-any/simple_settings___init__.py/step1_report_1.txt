  "purpose": "Importing LazySettings and settings from a local core module, likely for configuration management.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing LazySettings and settings from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external output; import statement alone does not handle data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only import statement referencing internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "This code imports configuration classes or variables from a local module named 'core'. There is no processing, data handling, or external communication. The import syntax is standard, with a comment to ignore linter warnings. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based solely on this line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement for configuration management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
