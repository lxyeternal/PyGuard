  "purpose": "Convert a string representation of a boolean value to a Python boolean (True/False).",
  "sources": "Input data is the parameter 'value' passed to strtobool.",
  "sinks": "The function accesses the _MAP dictionary to retrieve boolean values based on input.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is converted to lowercase string, then used as a key in _MAP to return a boolean.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward mapping. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary mapping various string representations to boolean values. The function converts the input to lowercase, looks up the mapping, and returns the corresponding boolean. If the key does not exist, it raises a ValueError. The logic is simple and typical for such conversions. No malicious code, external network interactions, or obfuscated code present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for string-to-boolean conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
