  "purpose": "Convert string representations of boolean values to actual boolean types with validation.",
  "sources": "Input value passed to strtobool function, which is converted to string and lowercased before lookup.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input value -> str(value).lower() -> lookup in _MAP -> return boolean or raise error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static dictionary, straightforward logic, no obfuscation, no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static mapping for common boolean string representations. The function converts input to string, normalizes case, and retrieves the boolean value, raising an error if invalid. No external dependencies, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The implementation is correct, simple, and secure. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No issues or suspicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for string-to-boolean conversion with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
