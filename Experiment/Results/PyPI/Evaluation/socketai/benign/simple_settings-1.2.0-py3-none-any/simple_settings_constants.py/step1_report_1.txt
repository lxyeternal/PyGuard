  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two constant string assignments defining configuration keys. There are no input sources, no data processing, no dynamic execution, nor any network activity. The code appears to serve as configuration key constants without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply defining string constants for settings keys with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
