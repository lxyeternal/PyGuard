  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of two string constant assignments defining configuration keys.\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, dynamic code execution, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is simple constant assignment with no security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all analyses indicate no malicious or suspicious behavior, a high risk score (>0.5) would be unjustified.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external data or dynamic execution.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is correctly assigned.\n\n6. **Claims About Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward declaration of configuration key constants with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n- All findings align with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.",
