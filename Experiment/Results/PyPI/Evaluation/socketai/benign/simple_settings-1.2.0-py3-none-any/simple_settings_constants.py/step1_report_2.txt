  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only assigns string constants.",
  "anomalies": "Simple string assignments with no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two string constants, presumably for configuration keys. There are no inputs, no dynamic execution, no data manipulation, and no network activity. It appears to be straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration constant declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
