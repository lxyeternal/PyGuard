  "anomalies": "Minimal; only constants are defined without any further logic",
  "analysis": "The code only defines two constants representing setting keys as strings. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no external interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from these assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is straightforward and benign.",
