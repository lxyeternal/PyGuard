  "purpose": "Define configuration keys as string constants for application settings.",
  "sources": "No input sources; code consists of static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; constants are standalone assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two string constant assignments for configuration keys, with no input handling, data processing, dynamic code, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's benign nature is clear, and the assessment aligns with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as simple configuration constants. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. The current scores are accurate and justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
