  "purpose": "Define constant keys for settings configuration",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple constant assignments",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two string constant assignments for settings keys. There are no dynamic inputs, no sensitive data, no code execution, and no interactions with external systems. The code appears straightforward and standard for configuration purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, defining constant keys for settings. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
