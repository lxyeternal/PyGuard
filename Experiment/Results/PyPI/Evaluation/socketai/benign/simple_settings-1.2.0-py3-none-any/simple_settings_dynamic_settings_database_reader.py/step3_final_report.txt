  "purpose": "Provides a database-backed configuration storage system using SQLAlchemy ORM, allowing get/set/flush operations for key-value pairs.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from the 'simple_settings' table in the database.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; data flows from database queries to return values.",
  "flows": "Input keys are used to query the database; data flows from ORM query results to return values or updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard ORM-based configuration management system with dependency handling and default in-memory SQLite database. It does not perform any malicious actions, contain obfuscation, or insecure practices. The default database is suitable for testing but not for production. No external communication or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic is straightforward, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a configuration ORM component. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The low security risk score (~0.2) is justified by the default in-memory database, which is acceptable for testing but should be replaced for production use.",
