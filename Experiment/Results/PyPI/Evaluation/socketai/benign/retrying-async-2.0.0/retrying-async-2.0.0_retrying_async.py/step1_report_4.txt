{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous retry mechanism for functions, allowing retries with delays, timeouts, and fallback behaviors.",
  "sources": "Potential sources of input include function arguments (fn_args, fn_kwargs), exception objects caught during retries, and possibly global or environment variables if used externally.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can potentially flow into fallback functions or be included in logs; however, no explicit data leaks or unsafe operations are evident within the code itself.",
  "flows": "The main flow involves calling a function repeatedly upon exceptions, with retries managed via callback and fallback mechanisms; exception handling controls the flow to retry or abort.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are evident. The use of placeholders like '...' for 'propagate' and 'forever' suggests incomplete or intentionally flexible configuration, but no malicious behavior is detectable.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an asyncio-based retry decorator with customizable retry attempts, delays, timeouts, and fallback strategies. It carefully handles exception classification, supports coroutine functions, and includes logging for retries and failures. No evidence of malicious activities such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system sabotage. The placeholders ('...') for certain variables could imply incomplete code or external configuration, but do not suggest malicious intent. The structure and logic follow standard retry patterns without obfuscation or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured asyncio retry decorator without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No malicious payloads or sabotage mechanisms are present. It is safe based on the provided code segment.",
