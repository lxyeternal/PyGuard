  "conclusion": "The code is a typical asyncio retry utility with placeholders indicating incomplete configuration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation. The main concern is proper setup of configuration variables to prevent runtime errors. The security risk is minimal, and the code is safe when properly configured."
