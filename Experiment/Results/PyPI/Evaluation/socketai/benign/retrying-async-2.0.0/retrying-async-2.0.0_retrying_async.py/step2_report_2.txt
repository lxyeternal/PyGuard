  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as an asyncio-based retry decorator with configurable attempts, delays, timeouts, fallback, and callback mechanisms.\n- They highlight the use of placeholders ('...') for variables like 'propagate' and 'forever', indicating incomplete or template code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious data flows are identified.\n- The code structure appears standard for a retry utility, with exception handling, logging, and support for coroutine and non-coroutine functions.\n- The main concern is the incomplete nature of some variables ('...' for 'propagate' and 'forever'), which could lead to runtime errors if not properly configured, but do not suggest malicious intent.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads is present.\n- The fallback and callback functions are user-supplied, which could be exploited if malicious functions are provided externally, but this is typical for such utilities.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does **not** contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code snippets.\n- The logic is consistent with a standard retry pattern.\n- The placeholder variables ('...') are likely meant for external configuration or incomplete code snippets, not malicious constructs.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malware detected, no suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, with no obfuscation patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to incomplete placeholders that could cause runtime errors if misconfigured, but not a security risk per se.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n- The use of '...' for 'propagate' and 'forever' could cause runtime errors if these are not properly initialized before use. This is a code completeness or configuration issue, not malicious.\n- The fallback defaults to 'propagate', which is undefined, indicating incomplete code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard asyncio retry utility, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The incomplete placeholders suggest it is either a template or an in-progress implementation, not a malicious payload.\n- If deployed as-is, runtime errors could occur due to uninitialized variables, but this is a code quality concern, not a security issue.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- Ensure that 'propagate' and 'forever' are properly defined before deployment.\n- Review fallback defaults to prevent runtime errors.\n- No further security concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to incomplete code, not malicious intent)\n\nThis code, as provided, appears safe and standard, with the main concern being the placeholders that need proper initialization.",
