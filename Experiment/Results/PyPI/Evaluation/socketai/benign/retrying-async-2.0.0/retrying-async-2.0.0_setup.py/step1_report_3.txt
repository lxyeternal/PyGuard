{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'retrying-async' Python package, used to package and distribute the module via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from 'retrying_async.py', reading 'README.rst' for long description, and importing system modules.",
  "targets": "No specific untrusted data sinks; the script performs file reading and package setup tasks.",
  "flows": "Reading file contents -> extracting version info -> configuring package metadata for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The regex for version extraction appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to read files and extract version info using regex, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. All code performs typical setup tasks. No malicious logic, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code's structure is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It safely configures package installation parameters without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
