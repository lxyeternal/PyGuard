{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'retrying-async' Python module, including version retrieval and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from 'retrying_async.py'; reading 'README.rst' for long description; environment variables not used; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The script primarily reads files and configures package metadata, with no output or network communication.",
  "flows": "Reading file contents to extract version and description; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "The 'get_version' function uses regex to parse version info from 'retrying_async.py', which is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for Python packaging. It reads version info from a source file and constructs package metadata. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or use of untrusted input. The approach to parse version info via regex is common. No hidden or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python module. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
