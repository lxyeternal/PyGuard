  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The report states that the code is a standard setup script, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It correctly identifies that version extraction via regex from 'retrying_async.py' is common and safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The code performs standard package setup tasks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of the code, with no external untrusted input, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The risk score is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The small risk score seems reasonable given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, confirms the code is a typical setup script with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Reiterates that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, confirming standard setup procedures, safe regex usage, no external or untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** None detected. All reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. Obfuscated scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present. Risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern—this is justified because the code performs straightforward file reading and package setup without external inputs or network activity.\n- **Potential Malicious Behavior:** None observed. The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or contain hidden backdoors.\n- **Assumptions Challenged:** The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they base their conclusions on the code's straightforward operations.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, reflecting the minimal potential for misconfiguration or indirect issues, but no actual threat)\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a typical, safe setup script. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and maintain a very low risk score (~0.1) due to the nature of the script.",
