  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging the 'retrying-async' Python module, extracting version info from a source file and reading package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'retrying_async.py' via regex, reads 'README.rst' for long description, and uses standard package setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external inputs; purely local file reads and package metadata setup.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local source file, reads description from local README, then passes data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; regex usage is standard; no external data or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading local files, extracting version info with regex, and calling setuptools.setup(). No external network activity, no code injection, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic. The regex for version extraction is a common pattern. All operations are safe and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration for a Python package. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening code. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
