{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'retrying-async'. It extracts version info, reads documentation, and configures package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Read operations in get_version() and read() functions that access files ('retrying_async.py' and 'README.rst').",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses these file contents to set package version and description; no untrusted data processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function reads the version string from 'retrying_async.py' and passes it to setup(), which uses it for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from a source file and package description from a README. No dynamic code execution, external data inputs, or suspicious behavior is present. The use of regex for version parsing is straightforward. The code relies on local files only, with no external inputs or untrusted data sources. All functions and setup parameters are typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It reads local files to gather metadata and configures the package accordingly.",
