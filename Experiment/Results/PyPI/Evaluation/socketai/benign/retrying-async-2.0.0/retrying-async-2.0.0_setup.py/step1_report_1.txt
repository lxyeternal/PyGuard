{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'retrying-async'.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'retrying_async.py', reading 'README.rst' file, and user-provided input during package setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external effect beyond package metadata processing.",
  "flows": "Reading 'retrying_async.py' to extract version -> Using this version in package setup -> Reading README file for long description -> Final package metadata setup.",
  "anomalies": "The 'get_version' function reads the version from 'retrying_async.py' using a regex; this is standard for version extraction but not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code imports standard libraries and uses common setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the version info dynamically from a Python file, which is typical in setup scripts. It uses regex to parse version string, which appears straightforward and safe. The read function reads files with utf-8 encoding; no external data input is involved that could lead to security issues. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code performs standard package setup operations with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It reads version info and metadata securely and performs no malicious actions or suspicious behaviors. No security risks are identified.",
