  "purpose": "Set up configuration and build commands for the pandas_schema package, including building documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst, version.py, and user input for directory paths.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocess calls for sphinx-build commands, potentially executing external build tools.",
  "flows": "Read version.py for version info -> build documentation with subprocess -> setup package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run external commands; no hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and sets up commands to build documentation via sphinx-build. It reads version info from a file, reads README content, and executes external commands during build steps. No data leaks, code injections, or suspicious external network communications are evident. The subprocess calls are controlled and involve known build tools. No malicious or backdoor code found. Usage of subprocess.check_call is standard for such build scripts and does not introduce security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with documentation build commands. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The subprocess calls are used for documentation building and do not involve untrusted inputs. Overall, it appears safe.",
