  "purpose": "Setup script for the pandas_schema Python package, handling metadata, version extraction, and documentation build commands.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst, reading version.py, subprocess calls to 'sphinx-build'",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls execute external commands; no untrusted input used",
  "flows": "File reads (README, version.py) -> subprocess commands for documentation build",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of exec() on version.py assumes trusted source",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks, including reading files, extracting version info via exec(), and invoking sphinx-build via subprocess with static arguments. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Subprocess commands are controlled and do not process untrusted input. No secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The use of exec() is common but should be trusted; otherwise, it could pose a risk if version.py is compromised. Overall, the script is a typical, benign setup utility with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup and documentation build script with no malicious intent or security issues. The current low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
