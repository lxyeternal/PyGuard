  "purpose": "Setup script for the pandas_schema Python package, including commands to build documentation and readme.",
  "sources": "File reading (version.py, README.rst), subprocess calls for sphinx-build commands.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.check_call commands executing sphinx-build, reading version.py and README.rst files.",
  "flows": "Reading version from version.py -> running sphinx-build commands -> executing subprocess calls for documentation builds.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code detected. Use of subprocess to run external commands is standard for documentation builds but can be risky if inputs are compromised; here, inputs appear static.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs setup tasks: reading files, executing external commands for documentation. The subprocess calls execute 'sphinx-build' with predefined arguments, which are static and not influenced by user input. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. The script uses standard setup practices for Python packages, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with documentation build commands. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The subprocess calls are to static commands with no user input, minimizing risk.",
