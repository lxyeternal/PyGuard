  "purpose": "Setup script for the pandas_schema Python package, including build commands and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README file, reads version information from 'pandas_schema/version.py', executes build commands via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing sphinx-build commands, reading version.py without sanitization.",
  "flows": "Reading version.py (source) -> executing subprocess commands for documentation build (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Execution of subprocess commands with static arguments; no input sanitization or dynamic input involved. No hardcoded secrets or credentials present. The code uses exec() on version.py, but assuming the file is trusted and controlled, this is standard for version extraction.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup and documentation build commands. It reads a README file and a version file, then runs sphinx-build commands for documentation. The subprocess calls are static and do not incorporate untrusted input. The exec() on version.py is a common pattern for extracting version info and does not inherently introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity is detected. The code adheres to normal packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. It safely performs package setup tasks and documentation builds. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
