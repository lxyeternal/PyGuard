  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the setup script is standard, performing package setup and documentation build tasks.\n- No report identifies actual malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The subprocess calls are to known tools ('sphinx-build') and involve static, controlled arguments.\n- The use of `exec()` on version.py is typical for version extraction, assuming the file is trusted.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The security risks are low, with most reports assigning a score of 0 or 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No issues or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores seem reasonable; no need for adjustments.\n- **Malware score justification:** All reports correctly assign malware score as 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly identify the code as standard packaging and documentation build scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that subprocess calls are controlled and involve known tools.\n- The use of `exec()` on version.py is standard, assuming the file is trusted.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, given the controlled environment.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** No changes needed; they are consistent with the analysis.\n- **Malware risk:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated code:** Remains at 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Overall risk:** Very low, consistent with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or slightly higher, but given the analysis, 0.1 is appropriate)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should be maintained.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; no modifications necessary. The code is safe, and the risk is minimal.",
