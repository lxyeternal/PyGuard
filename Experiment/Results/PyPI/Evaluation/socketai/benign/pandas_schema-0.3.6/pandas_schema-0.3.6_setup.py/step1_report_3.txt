  "purpose": "Setup script for the pandas_schema package, including custom build commands for documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads the README file, reads version information from version.py, and executes sphinx-build commands via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'sphinx-build' which could potentially run arbitrary commands if manipulated, and reading version.py.",
  "flows": "Reads version.py -> executes content; runs subprocess commands for documentation build.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The subprocess commands depend on external tools but are standard for documentation builds.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the package version dynamically, reads documentation files, and defines custom build commands that invoke sphinx-build via subprocess. No user input is processed, and subprocess commands appear standard for documentation purposes. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The subprocess calls are to well-known documentation tools; however, they could be exploited if an attacker manipulates the environment or files, but this is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python package distribution with custom documentation build commands. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The subprocess calls are used for building documentation and do not suggest malicious intent.",
