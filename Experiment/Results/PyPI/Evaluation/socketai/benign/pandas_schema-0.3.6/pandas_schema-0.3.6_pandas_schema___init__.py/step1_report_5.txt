{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules and a version identifier from a package, likely for internal use within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .column, .validation_warning, .schema, and .version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code contains straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a version variable. There are no functions, no data processing, and no external calls. It does not include any obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. The structure and content are typical for a module's import section in a Python package. No indicators of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving only to import necessary components for the package. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
