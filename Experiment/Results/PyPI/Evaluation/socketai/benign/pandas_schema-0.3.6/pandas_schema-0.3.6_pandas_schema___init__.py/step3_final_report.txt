{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a module initializer or API surface, importing internal components and version info for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.column, .validation_warning, .schema, .version).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only performs static imports without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from internal modules, typical for package __init__.py files. No dynamic code, network activity, or data leaks are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are consistent and justified. The confidence score of 1 is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current assessment scores are accurate and appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
