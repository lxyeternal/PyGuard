  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules (.column, .validation_warning, .schema, .version).\n- No data flow, external data handling, or code execution is observed.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py or similar setup file, serving as an API surface or module organization.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- The code is purely static import statements, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent: benign, standard package code with no security concerns.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Security risk score: 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n\n**Final justification:**\n- The code is a minimal, standard import pattern with no malicious or security issues.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are appropriately set to 0.\n- The confidence score of 1 is justified given the clear and benign nature of the code.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is entirely benign. No security concerns are present based on this snippet.",
