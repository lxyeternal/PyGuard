  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from local modules and a version attribute.\n- No data flow, external input/output, or dynamic behavior is observed.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.\n- Confidence is high (1) across all.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is purely static import statements; no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- No data leaks or external data handling.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reports. They are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The reasoning is sound: the code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable; all scores are 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Confirmed as 0 in all reports, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent based solely on static import statements, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the assessment is appropriate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**This code is benign, with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
