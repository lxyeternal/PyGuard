{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for validating pandas columns using the pandas_schema library, testing different validation scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reads data from pandas Series objects within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted sources or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from pandas Series into validation functions; results are stored and checked within test methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing and pandas libraries, defines test classes with specific validation configurations, and performs assertions to verify validation behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network access, data leaks, or other malicious actions. No dynamic code execution, external data manipulation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly tests pandas_schema functionalities with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for pandas_schema validation functions. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
