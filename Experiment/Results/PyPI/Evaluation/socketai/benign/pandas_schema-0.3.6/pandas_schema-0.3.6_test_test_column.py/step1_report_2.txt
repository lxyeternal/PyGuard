  "purpose": "Unit tests for pandas_schema validation classes and columns",
  "sources": "import statements, class definitions, test data in pandas Series",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform harmful actions",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this is test code without data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors; no unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unittests validating pandas_schema's Column class behavior with various validation rules. It defines test cases that check for correct validation behavior with different data inputs. The test data are static, controlled pandas Series, with no input from external sources. There are no network operations, file I/O, or data leaks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code strictly performs validation checks within a testing context.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard test code for a validation library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. It is safe and does not perform any harmful operations.",
