  "purpose": "Unit tests for the pandas_schema.ValidationWarning class to verify message formatting and row/column information inclusion.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of ValidationWarning objects, calling str() on them.",
  "sinks": "str() function output used in assertions, but no untrusted data input or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of ValidationWarning -> str() conversion -> regex assertions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard unit testing for a validation warning class, checking string representations for message content and optional row/column info. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. It strictly tests message formatting logic with no external data or system access. The use of regex assertions on class string output is typical for testing display messages and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite verifying message formatting of a validation warning class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be safe and benign.",
