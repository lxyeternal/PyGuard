  "flows": "Creation of ValidationWarning objects -> str() conversion -> regex matching in tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no external data, network, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured unit test suite verifying the display of row and column info in warning messages. It does not process untrusted input, perform system calls, or contain obfuscation. The tests are standard and confirm that the message formatting behaves as expected. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely to test message formatting logic, with no external dependencies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.",
