{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test verifying that the 'pandas_schema' package has a '__version__' attribute and that its version is at least 0.3.0.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__version__' attribute from the 'pandas_schema' package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; it only performs assertions within a test framework.",
  "flows": "The source is the retrieval of 'pandas_schema.__version__'; the flow leads to version parsing and comparison assertions, with no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for version validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign unit test that checks for the existence of a version attribute and ensures it meets a minimum version requirement. It uses standard libraries and performs no network activity, code execution beyond standard assertions, or data handling. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward version check with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
