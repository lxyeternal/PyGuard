{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test to verify that the pandas_schema package has a version number defined and that it meets a minimum version requirement.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version attribute (__version__) from the pandas_schema module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used; the code only performs internal assertions.",
  "flows": "The source (__version__) data flows into version.parse() for comparison, which then influences test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard version checking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports unittest for testing framework and packaging.version for version comparison. It defines a test case class to check for the existence of the __version__ attribute in pandas_schema and asserts it is at least 0.3.0. The code is straightforward and uses well-known libraries for version handling. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident. It performs a simple, benign check on the package's version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless unit test for version verification of a package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
