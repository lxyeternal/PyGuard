  "purpose": "Unit test to verify the version of the pandas_schema package is defined and meets a minimum version requirement.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ attribute from pandas_schema.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data or external outputs are used.",
  "flows": "The code reads pandas_schema.__version__, then parses and compares it to a specified version.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports unittest and version parsing, then defines a test case to verify the presence and version of pandas_schema. It performs standard assertions for package version validation. No external data input, no insecure code patterns, and no signs of malicious behavior are present. The code functions solely for version checking, which is typical in testing scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for package version validation with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
