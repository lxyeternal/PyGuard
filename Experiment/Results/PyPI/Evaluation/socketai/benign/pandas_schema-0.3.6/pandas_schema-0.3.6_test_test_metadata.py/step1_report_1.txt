  "purpose": "Unit test to verify that the pandas_schema package has a __version__ attribute and that its version is at least 0.3.0.",
  "sources": "The code reads the pandas_schema.__version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to potential data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code accesses pandas_schema.__version__, parses it, and asserts conditions based on it.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward unit test that verifies the presence and minimum version of the pandas_schema package. It uses standard library functions and the packaging library to parse and compare versions. There are no external inputs, network connections, or code execution outside standard testing practices. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected in the code structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test checking package version requirements. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
