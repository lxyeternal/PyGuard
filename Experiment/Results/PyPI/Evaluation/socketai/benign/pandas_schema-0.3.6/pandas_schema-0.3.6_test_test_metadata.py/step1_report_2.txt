  "purpose": "The code is a unit test to verify the presence and minimum version requirement of the 'pandas_schema' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__version__' attribute from the 'pandas_schema' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "The version string from 'pandas_schema.__version__' is parsed and compared to ensure it meets the minimum version requirement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The code performs a straightforward version check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing and version parsing libraries. It defines a test case to confirm that 'pandas_schema' has a version attribute and that the version is at least 0.3.0. The logic is simple, focusing on package version validation. No external input, no malicious behavior, and no suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test verifying package version requirements. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
