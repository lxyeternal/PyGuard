{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to run and test Python scripts (example.py and boolean.py) by executing them and comparing their output to expected results stored in text files.",
  "sources": "Reads files from the filesystem: 'example.py', 'boolean.py', 'example.txt', and 'boolean.txt'; also reads the script's own source code via __file__.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'exec' to execute the contents of the target Python scripts; reads files from disk; outputs to stdout via redirect_stdout.",
  "flows": "Reads code files; compiles code; executes code with 'exec'; captures stdout; compares output to expected text files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code read from files introduces risk; no input validation or sandboxing is evident; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs dynamic execution of external Python files using 'exec', which can be dangerous if those files contain malicious code. It reads source code and output files from a controlled directory structure. No suspicious behavior like network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is observed. The use of 'exec' is a potential security concern, but in this context, it appears intended for testing purposes. No malware signatures or obfuscated code are present. The overall structure is typical of a test harness, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a testing script that executes other Python scripts and compares their output to expected results. While the use of 'exec' on external code is generally risky, within a controlled test environment, it is not malicious. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
