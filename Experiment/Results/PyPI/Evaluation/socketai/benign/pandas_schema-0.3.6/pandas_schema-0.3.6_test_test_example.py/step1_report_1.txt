{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to run and verify Python scripts ('example.py' and 'boolean.py') by executing them and comparing their output to expected results stored in text files.",
  "sources": "Code reads external Python scripts ('example.py', 'boolean.py') and expected output text files ('example.txt', 'boolean.txt') from a filesystem.",
  "sinks": "The code executes external Python scripts dynamically using 'exec' on compiled code objects, and captures stdout for comparison. The main potential concern is executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input files ('example.py' and 'boolean.py') are read and compiled, then executed via 'exec'. Output is captured and compared to reference files. Data flows from file read, compilation, execution, and output capture.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The use of 'exec' to run external scripts dynamically could be risky if those scripts are malicious, but as part of a test suite, this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code reads external Python scripts and expected output files, compiles and executes the scripts, and compares runtime output with expected results. The use of 'exec' on external code can be a security concern if the source files are untrusted, but in a controlled testing environment, this is typical. There are no signs of malicious code or backdoors. The code itself does not contain malicious behavior; its purpose is testing and validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a testing harness that executes external scripts and compares output. No malicious intent is apparent, but executing external code can be risky if source files are compromised. Overall, this code is safe within a trusted environment, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
