  "purpose": "Testing harness that reads, compiles, executes external Python scripts, and compares output to expected results.",
  "sources": "External script files ('example.py', 'boolean.py') read via open(), data read from these files.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external code via 'exec()' which could run malicious code if files are compromised.",
  "flows": "Source: reading external script files -> compile() -> exec() -> output captured -> compare with expected output.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, straightforward code; potential security concern is executing external code without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads external scripts, compiles, and executes them dynamically, capturing stdout for comparison. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The primary security risk is executing external code via 'exec()' without validation, which could be exploited if those scripts are malicious. The code itself is benign and typical for testing environments. Malware presence is not detected; scores should reflect that. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score moderate (~0.3-0.4) considering the potential danger of executing untrusted code. The assessments from the reports are consistent and reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing pattern with no malicious intent or payloads. The main security concern is executing external scripts without validation, which warrants caution but does not constitute malware. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.3-0.4) is appropriate given the context.",
