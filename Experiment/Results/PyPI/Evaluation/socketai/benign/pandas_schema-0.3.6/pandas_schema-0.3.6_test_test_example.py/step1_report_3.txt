{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads and executes other Python scripts ('example.py' and 'boolean.py') from a specified directory, comparing their output to reference text files to validate correctness.",
  "sources": "Reading 'example.py', 'boolean.py', and their corresponding '.txt' files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the dynamically loaded Python code via 'exec()' which can run any code within those files, potentially including malicious code.",
  "flows": "File read ('compile') -> 'exec()' executes the code which can run arbitrary code potentially malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' on code loaded from files without any sanitization or validation. The code depends on external files that could be tampered with, enabling malicious payload execution.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'compile()' and 'exec()' to run external Python scripts, which is inherently risky if those scripts are malicious or compromised. The code does not perform any validation, sandboxing, or security checks on the loaded scripts. The comparison to text files is benign, but the core risk stems from executing untrusted code directly. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. However, the execution method itself is a significant security concern due to the potential for malicious payloads in the target scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code poses a high security risk because it executes external Python scripts directly via 'exec()' without validation, making it susceptible to executing malicious code if the input files are compromised. It is advisable to avoid executing external code in this manner or implement validation and sandboxing.",
