  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pandas_schema error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no data input, external calls, or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from BaseException and a parent class. No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is clear, standard, and contains no obfuscation or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. The code does not perform any malicious activity, contain secrets, or perform insecure operations. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
