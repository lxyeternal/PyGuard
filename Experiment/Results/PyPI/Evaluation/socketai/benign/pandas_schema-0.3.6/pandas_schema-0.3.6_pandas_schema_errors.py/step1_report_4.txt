  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pandas_schema validation errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; no sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are simple exception definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException and a parent error class. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The classes serve as error types for pandas_schema validation but do not perform any malicious actions or contain security risks. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not read untrusted data, execute code dynamically, or contain anomalies. No malware or security risks are present.",
