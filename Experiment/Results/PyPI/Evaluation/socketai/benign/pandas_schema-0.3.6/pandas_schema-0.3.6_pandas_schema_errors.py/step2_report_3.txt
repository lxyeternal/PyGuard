  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `BaseException` and a parent class `PanSchError`.\n   - All classes contain only docstrings explaining their purpose.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The structure is straightforward and typical for exception class definitions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.\n   - No data flow, input handling, or external dependencies.\n   - No code injection, dynamic execution, or other malicious techniques.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero.\n   - Given the benign nature of the code, these scores seem appropriate.\n   - The reports' confidence levels are high (1), which aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No overestimations or underestimations of risk are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound: the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a minimal, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
