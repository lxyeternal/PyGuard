  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `BaseException` and a parent class `PanSchError`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as error classes for a pandas schema validation framework.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard for exception class definitions.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all at 1, reflecting certainty.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree that there is no malicious behavior, no security risk, and no obfuscation, elevating the risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is straightforward class definitions with no security implications.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are based on the static analysis of the code structure.\n   \n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis provided.\n   - The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores given are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
