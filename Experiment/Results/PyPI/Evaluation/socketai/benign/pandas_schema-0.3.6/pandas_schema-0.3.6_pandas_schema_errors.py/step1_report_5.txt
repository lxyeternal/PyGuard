  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pandas schema validation errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow involving untrusted input; only class inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class hierarchy with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException and PanSchError, serving as structured error types for pandas schema validation. There are no input sources, no data processing, or any code execution beyond class declarations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present. The code is purely structural and serves as part of error handling architecture.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard class definitions for exception handling without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears safe and straightforward, serving a clear purpose within a larger codebase.",
