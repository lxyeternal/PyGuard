  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code only defines three custom exception classes inheriting from `BaseException` and a parent class `PanSchError`. There are no data inputs, processing, or external interactions.\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n   - They correctly identify that these are simple class definitions serving as error types.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of 0 for malware and security risk, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, handling secrets, or network activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is purely structural and benign.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are inferred.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified by the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions for a pandas schema validation framework. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
