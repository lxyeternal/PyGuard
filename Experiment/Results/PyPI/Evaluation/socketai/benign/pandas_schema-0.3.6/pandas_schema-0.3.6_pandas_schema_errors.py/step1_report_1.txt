{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pandas_schema-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no such operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException and PanSchError, with clear docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no data inputs, no external calls, no data processing, and no potential points of malicious data manipulation or leakage. The structure is straightforward and standard for exception class definitions. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of class definitions for exception handling related to pandas_schema. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
