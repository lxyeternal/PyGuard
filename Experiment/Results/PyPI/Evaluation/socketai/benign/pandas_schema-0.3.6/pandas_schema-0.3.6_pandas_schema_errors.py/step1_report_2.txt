  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pandas_schema validation framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code only defines classes and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow, input, or output logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The code consists solely of class definitions and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException and a parent class PanSchError. The classes contain only docstrings describing their purpose. There are no data inputs, outputs, or any executable logic that could be malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious activity is evident. The structure is straightforward and conventional for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign definition of custom exception classes for a validation library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
