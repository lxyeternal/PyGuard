{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pandas_schema validation errors",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no external input reading",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output involved",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are for error handling only",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes inheriting from BaseException and PanSchError, with descriptive docstrings. There are no data input, output, or security-sensitive operations. The classes serve as structured error types for pandas schema validation, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions with no malicious or security risk elements. It appears to be standard error class definitions for a Python package, with no indication of malware or security issues.",
