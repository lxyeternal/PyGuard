  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to pandas_schema. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic, which aligns with the original code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors or overlooked issues are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious behavior is present.  \n- **Security Risk (0)**: Correct, no vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nSince all reports confidently assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and given the nature of the code, there is no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious patterns, dynamic code, or data handling. They do not assume vulnerabilities without evidence.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \nScores are consistent and appropriate, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:  \n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present.  \n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Final Conclusion**:  \nThe code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
