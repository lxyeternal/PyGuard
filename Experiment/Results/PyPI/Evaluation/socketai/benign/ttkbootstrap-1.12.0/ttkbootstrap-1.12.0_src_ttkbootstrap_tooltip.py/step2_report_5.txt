  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code creates styled tooltips, handles events, and uses standard ttkbootstrap components. No malicious intent is evident.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Scores malware=0, obfuscated=0, which aligns with the code.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.1), justified by the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurately describes the tooltip implementation, event handling, and styling. No suspicious activity or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and thorough. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states that the code manages tooltip display with standard components and event handling, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Properly describes the tooltip logic, event bindings, and style configuration. No malicious activity or suspicious code is evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Accurately characterizes the code as a standard tooltip implementation with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely UI enhancement.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the consistent findings across all reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, due to the potential for misuse if parameters are manipulated, but inherently safe)\n\n**Note:** The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of tooltip functionality using ttkbootstrap, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors detected. |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.             |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1          | Very low; typical UI component with minimal risk.           |\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of all reports and the code analysis.",
