  "purpose": "The code defines a Tooltip class for displaying styled tooltip popups in a ttkbootstrap GUI application. It facilitates showing helpful information when hovering over widgets.",
  "sources": "Reads data from widget events such as '<Enter>', '<Leave>', '<Motion>', and '<ButtonPress>' to manage tooltip display timing and position.",
  "sinks": "Creates and destroys a Toplevel window containing a Label widget with tooltip text, styled according to user input. No untrusted data directly influences system-critical functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "Event bindings trigger methods that schedule, display, move, or hide the tooltip window, based on mouse position and user interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of styling and tooltip display is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a tooltip mechanism using standard tkinter-like event handling and ttkbootstrap styling. It securely manages widget interactions, dynamically creates/destroys tooltip windows, and applies styles without executing external or untrusted code. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward GUI utility component, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign GUI tooltip implementation with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs expected functions for a user interface component with safe practices.",
