{
  "purpose": "This code defines a tooltip class for displaying informative popups when hovering over GUI widgets in a ttkbootstrap application.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include widget events such as '<Enter>', '<Leave>', '<Motion>', and '<ButtonPress>' to trigger tooltip display, and user interactions with the GUI widgets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve creation and destruction of Toplevel windows and Labels for displaying tooltips, and geometry updates for moving tooltip windows.",
  "flows": "Sources trigger event handlers that schedule or cancel tooltip display; scheduled functions create or move tooltip windows, which can be destroyed to hide tooltips.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to follow standard tooltip implementation practices without hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. It uses common tkinter methods and ttkbootstrap styling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Tooltip class that manages display and movement of tooltip windows on widget hover events. It configures styles, manages event bindings, and creates/destroys tooltip Toplevel windows with labels. No suspicious or malicious code such as network access, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. It uses standard GUI operations and styling procedures. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code’s purpose is benign, providing user interface enhancements without any indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code implements a standard tooltip widget for a tkinter-based GUI using ttkbootstrap. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres typical GUI programming practices. Overall, it presents a low security risk with no signs of malicious activity.",
