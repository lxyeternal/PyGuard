{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Tooltip class for displaying styled tooltip popups over widgets in a Tkinter-based GUI application, with no apparent malicious intent. It provides utility for user interface enhancement.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include widget events such as <Enter>, <Leave>, <Motion>, and <ButtonPress>, as well as constructor parameters like 'text', 'bootstyle', 'wraplength', and 'image'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the creation of Toplevel windows, label configurations, and widget event handling that could be manipulated for malicious purposes if untrusted input is used to modify these parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from widget event triggers to functions that create or move tooltip windows, utilizing user or programmatic input parameters like mouse position and tooltip text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of standard ttkbootstrap components and styling is appropriate. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. No external network connections or data exfiltration routines present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily creates styled tooltip windows for GUI widgets, handling events to display and hide tooltips with configurable styles and positioning. It uses standard Tkinter and ttkbootstrap components, with typical event binding and window management. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoor functionality are evident. The tooltip content is supplied via parameters, with no evident manipulation or injection risk given the context.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a benign implementation of styled tooltip functionality for a Tkinter GUI, with no malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or malware indicators. The use of standard libraries and straightforward event handling supports this conclusion.",
