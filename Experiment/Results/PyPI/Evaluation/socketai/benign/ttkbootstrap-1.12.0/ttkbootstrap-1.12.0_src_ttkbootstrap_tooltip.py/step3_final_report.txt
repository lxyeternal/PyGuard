  "purpose": "Implements a styled tooltip popup for ttkbootstrap widgets, showing text on hover with configurable style and position.",
  "sources": "Widget mouse events (<Enter>, <Leave>, <Motion>, <ButtonPress>) triggering tooltip display and movement.",
  "sinks": "Creation and destruction of ttk.Toplevel and ttk.Label for displaying tooltip text, positioning via geometry.",
  "flows": "Event bindings lead to show_tip() creating a Toplevel, move_tip() updating position, hide_tip() destroying it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution; standard GUI operations only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a styled tooltip for ttkbootstrap GUIs, managing event bindings, window creation, and styling securely. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The data flows are typical for GUI components, with no external data or network activity. The styling and event handling are standard, and no anomalies are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is a safe, utility component with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard tooltip utility for ttkbootstrap GUIs with no malicious or security issues. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
