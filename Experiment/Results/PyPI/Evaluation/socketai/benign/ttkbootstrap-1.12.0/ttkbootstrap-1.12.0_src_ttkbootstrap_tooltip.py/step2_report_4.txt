  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a benign implementation of a tooltip utility for ttkbootstrap-based GUIs.\n- No malicious intent, backdoors, external network activity, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The primary functions involve event handling, window creation/destruction, and styling, all standard for GUI components.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0 or very close to 0, securityRisk: very low) are consistent with the findings.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident; the code is straightforward and follows standard practices.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware score: 0 (or very close to 0) across all reports, which is appropriate.\n  - Security risk: very low (around 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Potential Sinks:** Creation of Toplevel windows and labels, which are standard and not malicious.\n- **Data flows:** From event triggers to tooltip display/hide, with no external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None of the reports identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports correctly identify this as a standard, safe GUI component with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the high confidence levels (mostly 1.0) are justified.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or similar very low value)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the code's straightforward, safe implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard tooltip utility for Tkinter/ttkbootstrap GUIs. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The provided scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
