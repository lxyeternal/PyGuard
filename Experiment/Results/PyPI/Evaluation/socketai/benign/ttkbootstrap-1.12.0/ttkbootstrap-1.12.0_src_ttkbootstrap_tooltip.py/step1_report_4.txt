{
  "purpose": "The code provides a tooltip implementation for ttkbootstrap widgets, displaying styled informational popups on hover.",
  "sources": "Input events: '<Enter>', '<Leave>', '<Motion>', and '<ButtonPress>' bindings on widgets; attribute inputs such as 'text', 'bootstyle', 'wraplength', 'delay', and 'image'.",
  "sinks": "Creation and destruction of ttk.Toplevel windows and ttk.Label widgets for displaying tooltips; use of widget.geometry for positioning; configuring label styles.",
  "flows": "User hovers over widget → '<Enter>' triggers schedule() → after delay, show_tip() creates tooltip window with label → move_tip() updates position with pointer movement → '<Leave>' or button press triggers hide_tip() which destroys tooltip.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features. The style configuration and event handling are standard. No external network access or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tooltip class that binds mouse events to show or hide a styled tooltip window. The tooltip creation uses standard ttk widgets and styling, with position updates based on mouse movement. No code injection, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a typical GUI tooltip implementation without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward tooltip widget implementation for tkinter-based GUIs using ttkbootstrap. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and follows normal patterns for GUI interaction. It is safe and does not exhibit obfuscated or harmful code features.",
