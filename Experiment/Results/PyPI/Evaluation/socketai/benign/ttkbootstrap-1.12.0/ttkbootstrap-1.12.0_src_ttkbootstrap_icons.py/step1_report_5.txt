  "purpose": "This module provides classes and data structures to manage emojis and icons, primarily for use in GUI applications with tkinter, including base64 encoded images and emoji metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads emoji data from the static list `_ITEMS`, which contains emoji objects, and loads base64 image strings assigned to class attributes in `Icon`.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of the base64 strings in `Icon` for image rendering via `tk.PhotoImage`, and the `Emoji.get()` method returning `EmojiItem` objects based on user input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static emoji list `_ITEMS` or icon strings through lookup functions `get()` or categories/subcategories methods, which then can be used in GUI components. User input (e.g., emoji names) can flow into `get()` for lookup.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. All base64 strings appear to be standard images, and the list of emojis is static. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or code injection observed. No external network calls, file I/O, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and static resources for emojis and icons. The base64 strings are used for GUI images, not for code execution. The emoji list `_ITEMS` is purely data, with lookup functions that return emoji objects based on name matching. No external input, network activity, or malicious patterns are evident. The structure and data are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource module for managing emoji and icon assets in GUI applications. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The static base64 strings are safe images, and the functions perform simple data retrieval without executing untrusted code.",
