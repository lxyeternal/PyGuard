  "purpose": "Static resource module providing icon images and emoji data for GUI applications.",
  "sources": "Base64 image strings in class attributes; static emoji list (_ITEMS) used for lookups.",
  "sinks": "Lookup functions access static data; no external data or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "Static data stored in class attributes; lookup methods iterate over in-memory lists; no external or dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious data. The base64 images are benign, and the emoji list is static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static resource module with predefined images and emoji data. No external network calls, code injection, or obfuscation are present. Lookup functions are straightforward, iterating over static lists. The base64 images are standard icons, and the emoji list contains Unicode characters with no embedded payloads. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, safe resource module for GUI icons and emojis. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The current scores and analysis are appropriate and justified.",
