  "purpose": "The code implements a Tkinter GUI table component with features such as sorting, filtering, exporting, and row/column manipulation for data management.",
  "sources": "User interactions (clicks, selections), initial parameters for columns and rows, file dialogs for CSV export.",
  "sinks": "File I/O operations for CSV export, GUI updates, data modifications within internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal data structures to GUI display and vice versa; no external network activity or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or covert channels detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured GUI component for data display and management. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or sabotage. Export functions involve standard file dialogs and CSV writing, typical for such applications. No external network activity or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, feature-rich GUI table component with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use.",
