  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1 & 2 & 4 & 5:**\n   - All report entries are \"Empty response,\" indicating no findings or issues reported.\n   - No code issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors identified.\n   - The detailed analysis in reports 3 and 4 confirms that the code is a standard, well-structured GUI table component.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n\n2. **Report 3 & 4 (detailed analysis):**\n   - Confirmed that the code reads data from initialization parameters and user interactions.\n   - Export functions perform CSV writing with user file dialogs, which is standard.\n   - No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, no credentials, or backdoors.\n   - No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** Both reports 3 and 4 assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** Both assign 0, consistent with the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Risk score:** Given the detailed review and no malicious or vulnerable patterns, a low risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n4. **Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?**\n   - The scores align well with the detailed analysis.\n   - No reason to increase malware, obfuscation, or risk scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code appears safe, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores given (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive review and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports correctly identify no issues.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on this review.",
