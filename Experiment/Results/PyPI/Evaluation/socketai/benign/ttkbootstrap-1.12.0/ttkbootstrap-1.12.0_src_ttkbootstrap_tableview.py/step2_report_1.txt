  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1 & 2 & 4 & 5 (Empty responses):**  \n   These contain no information, errors, or indications of issues. They are not relevant for security assessment.\n\n2. **Report 3 (Detailed analysis):**  \n   - **Purpose & Sources:** The code implements a Tkinter GUI table component with features like sorting, filtering, exporting, and row/column manipulation. Data flows from user interactions and initial parameters into internal data structures, with no external data sources or network activity.\n   - **Sinks:** File I/O for CSV export, GUI updates, data modifications. No external network activity or code execution.\n   - **Anomalies:** No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious patterns. Usage of standard libraries and typical GUI patterns.\n   - **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a well-structured, feature-rich GUI table component for data management. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n\n**Assessment of Security Risks & Scores:**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Both reports 3 and 5 explicitly state no malware or malicious activity is present, with a confidence of 0.95.  \n  **Given the detailed review and absence of malicious indicators, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  No obfuscation is present; the code is clear and standard.  \n  **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The code is a GUI component for data display and management, with no external or internal malicious activity. The only potential concern could be data export, but that is a standard feature and not inherently risky.  \n  **Risk score should be low, e.g., 0.0 or 0.1, depending on the scoring system.**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Justification                                              | Recommended Value |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware        | No malicious code, network activity, or covert channels.   | 0.0               |\n| Obfuscated     | Code is clear, no obfuscation patterns detected.            | 0.0               |\n| Risk           | Standard GUI data management features; no security issues. | 0.0 or 0.1        |\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe reports' evaluations are consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence (0.95) and malware score of 0 support that the code is safe and intended for legitimate use.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security incident reports do not indicate any malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk issues within this code. The scores should reflect that: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
