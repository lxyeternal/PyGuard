  "purpose": "Importing and setting up styling and widget components for a Tkinter-based GUI application using ttkbootstrap.",
  "sources": "Imports from ttkbootstrap.style, ttkbootstrap.widgets, ttkbootstrap.window, and tkinter modules; the setup_ttkbootstrap_api() function call.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is primarily import statements and a setup function call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of setup_ttkbootstrap_api() without additional context; no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard GUI setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports styling and widget modules from ttkbootstrap, a known GUI toolkit, and calls a setup function to initialize the ttkbootstrap API. All imported modules are standard and used for GUI construction. No user input handling, network operations, or data processing are present. The code is purely preparatory, setting up the GUI environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard GUI setup sequence with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply prepares the environment for a Tkinter application using ttkbootstrap.",
