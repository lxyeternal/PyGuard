{
  "purpose": "Import and setup styles and widgets from the ttkbootstrap library for GUI development.",
  "sources": "Imports from ttkbootstrap.style, ttkbootstrap.widgets, ttkbootstrap.window, tkinter.scrolledtext, and tkinter modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The call to Bootstyle.setup_ttkbootstap_api() is a standard setup call, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a single setup function call. All imports are from well-known libraries intended for GUI development (ttkbootstrap, tkinter). The setup function is likely initializing or configuring the library. No code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The structure and content are typical for a GUI application setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard GUI initialization code with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate setup for a Tkinter-based application using ttkbootstrap.",
