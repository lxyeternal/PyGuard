  "purpose": "Import GUI components from ttkbootstrap and tkinter, then initialize the ttkbootstrap API setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ttkbootstrap.style, ttkbootstrap.widgets, ttkbootstrap.window, and tkinter modules; call to Bootstyle.setup_ttkbootstap_api().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports provide modules; the setup call initializes the ttkbootstrap API; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in method name: 'setup_ttkbootstap_api()' instead of 'setup_ttkbootstrap_api()'.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a single setup call. The method name appears misspelled, which could cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The typo is a minor correctness issue rather than a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard GUI setup with a likely typo in the method name. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only issue is the typo, which should be corrected for proper execution, but it does not pose a security threat.",
