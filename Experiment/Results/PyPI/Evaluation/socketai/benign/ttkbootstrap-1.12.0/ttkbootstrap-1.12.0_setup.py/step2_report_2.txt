  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the code and scores step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library (`ttkbootstrap`).\n- The `long_description` is a static Markdown string with documentation, images, and links.\n- The setup parameters are typical, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code sections are identified.\n- Commented lines are benign and common in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script, no issues.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, static data, no malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully benign, appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, standard package setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, package configuration.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation. The only note is a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which seems high given the static nature.\n- **Score justification:** Since no suspicious behavior is present, a `securityRisk` of 0.1 seems unjustified. It should be 0.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score should be lowered to 0; no actual security risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, package setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, static setup script.\n- The only inconsistency is in **Report 3**, which assigns a `securityRisk` score of 0.1 despite no evidence of risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All should be **0**; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All should be **0**; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** For Report 3, **0** instead of 0.1, as no security risk is demonstrated.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code, no obfuscation)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, static code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security vulnerabilities or risks identified)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script. All reports are accurate in their assessments, except for the minor overestimation of risk in Report 3.",
