{
  "purpose": "The code is for configuring the setup of a Python package named 'ttkbootstrap', providing metadata and installation dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup configuration reads metadata from variables such as 'long_description' and dependencies from 'install_requires'. It also reads package data from specified directories (though commented out).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that could lead to data leaks, command execution, or other malicious actions. It primarily sets up package installation parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings (e.g., 'long_description', 'install_requires') into setup functions; no untrusted input processing or runtime data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets beyond standard package metadata. The setup script appears typical for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It defines a lengthy descriptive string about the package. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package locations. All operations are standard for Python package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is observed. The commented lines do not introduce malicious behavior. Overall, this is a typical, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It does not perform any runtime actions beyond package configuration.",
