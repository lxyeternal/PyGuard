{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'ttkbootstrap' with metadata, dependencies, and package configuration for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'long_description' string, setup parameters, and dependencies list ('install_requires').",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; package setup code primarily configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input data (long_description, dependencies) flows into the setuptools.setup() function; no external data flow to untrusted sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected. The 'long_description' is static markdown content, and setup configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for Python packaging. It imports setuptools, defines a long description with Markdown content, and calls setuptools.setup() with metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. There are no indications of code execution from untrusted sources, malicious code insertion, or obfuscated code. All data appears static and intended for package configuration. No suspicious behaviors such as network calls, dynamic code execution, or handling of sensitive data are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply configures package metadata, dependencies, and packaging details. The long description is static Markdown content, and there are no code injection or data leak risks.",
