  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the ttkbootstrap library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Read-only data: long_description string containing Markdown content with links, images, and documentation info; package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable operations. No untrusted data handling or output beyond package metadata.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks. Package setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated sections, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or malicious commands. Commented out lines are benign and typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. The long_description variable contains Markdown for documentation and is used as a static string. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or external communications. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The script adheres to typical package setup conventions and does not include any obfuscated or potentially malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies for the ttkbootstrap library. No malicious activity or sabotage detected.",
