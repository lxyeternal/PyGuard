{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'ttkbootstrap', including metadata, dependencies, and package data, to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for metadata, description, and URLs; uses setuptools functions to discover packages; reads the 'long_description' variable; and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak; the code only involves static configuration and dependency declarations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static variables into the setuptools.setup() function parameters; no dynamic or untrusted input is involved; dependencies are specified statically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The commented-out lines for 'include_package_data' and 'package_data' do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. No code executes external commands, network activity, or processes untrusted data. The description is extensive but static; no suspicious imports, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies are standard, with a specific version requirement for 'pillow'. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration for packaging the 'ttkbootstrap' library.",
