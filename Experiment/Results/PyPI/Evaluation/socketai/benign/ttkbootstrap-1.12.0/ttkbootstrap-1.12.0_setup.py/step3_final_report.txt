  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the ttkbootstrap Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Static strings in long_description, package metadata, dependencies, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; commented lines are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup script with static metadata and description. No dynamic or external data handling, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The long_description contains Markdown content with images and links but nothing malicious. The dependency on pillow is standard. Overall, the script is typical for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, though some overestimate the security risk score. The malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
