{
  "purpose": "Set up the 'ttkbootstrap' Python package, including metadata, description, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data in the setup() call, long_description string, and import of setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not handle or execute untrusted input data.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration defines package properties but does not process external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The long_description contains a lot of Markdown content, which is typical for package descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library for package setup, then defines a long description string with Markdown content detailing the package features, installation, and usage. The setup() function specifies package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, classifiers, URL, package discovery, dependencies, and Python version requirements. No code execution, data handling, or user input processing occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious dependencies. The package appears to be a standard, well-documented Python setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script for Python, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and configuration. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
