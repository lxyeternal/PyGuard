  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'mailer' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, url, and optional configuration via 'extra'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The script reads static metadata to configure package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The use of 'use_2to3' is standard for compatibility, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using 'setuptools'. It conditionally updates configuration based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
