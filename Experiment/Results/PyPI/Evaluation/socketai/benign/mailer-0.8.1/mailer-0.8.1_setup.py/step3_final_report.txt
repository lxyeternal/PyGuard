  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'mailer' Python module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' and 'sys'; reads package metadata and configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "Imports -> conditional update of 'extra' -> setup() call with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'use_2to3=True', but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script defining package metadata for 'mailer'. It conditionally adds 'use_2to3=True' for legacy Python 2 support, which is outdated but not harmful. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. The code is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or security issues. All signals indicate benign intent, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or security concerns. The use of 'use_2to3' is outdated but not malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence. No modifications are necessary.",
