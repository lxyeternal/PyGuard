  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module named 'mailer'.\n- The code primarily imports 'setuptools' and 'sys', conditionally updates an 'extra' dictionary with 'use_2to3=True' for Python 2 support, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata.\n- No reports identify any malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious behavior.\n- The use of 'use_2to3=True' is outdated but not malicious; it indicates legacy support.\n- No untrusted data input, network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with no anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- The 'malware' score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The 'securityRisk' score is also 0.\n- The 'obfuscated' score is 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The confidence level is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code matches the description of a typical setup.py script.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activities.\n- The use of 'use_2to3' is outdated but not malicious or obfuscated.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are appropriate given the evidence.\n- The risk score remains at 0, malware score at 0, and obfuscated at 0.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThis is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python module. No malicious activity or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and consensus across reports.",
