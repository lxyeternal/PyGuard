  "purpose": "A Python module to send emails via SMTP, supporting attachments, HTML content, threading, and various SMTP configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data includes email headers (From, To, CC, BCC, Subject), email body, attachments, and SMTP server details.",
  "sinks": "SMTP server connection for sending emails; reading attachment files; setting email headers.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers, body, attachments) flows into email message construction; message is sent via SMTP connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured email utility library supporting multiple SMTP configurations, attachments, and HTML content. It does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity. The scoring across multiple reports consistently indicates no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and very low security risk (~0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given its functionality. The code's operations are typical for email sending and do not present security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard email utility library with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified and consistent across reports. No modifications are necessary.",
