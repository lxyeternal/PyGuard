{
  "purpose": "Define hook implementation functions for the 'eggsample' plugin, adding ingredients and modifying condiments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'ingredients' and 'condiments'.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'condiments' dictionary directly, which could affect external state; however, no external data is read or written in an insecure manner.",
  "flows": "Functions receive data structures, manipulate them (read and modify), and return results. No untrusted data flow leading to security issues is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The manipulation of the 'condiments' dictionary is standard and benign. No suspicious external calls or data leaks are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two plugin hook functions for 'eggsample'. The first returns a list based on whether 'egg' is in the input ingredients list. The second deletes a key 'steak sauce' if present and adds 'spam sauce' with value 42 to the 'condiments' dictionary. These operations are straightforward modifications without any external data fetching, network activity, or security-sensitive behavior. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard plugin functions with benign data manipulation. No malicious activity or security risks are identified. The operations are typical and do not pose a security threat.",
