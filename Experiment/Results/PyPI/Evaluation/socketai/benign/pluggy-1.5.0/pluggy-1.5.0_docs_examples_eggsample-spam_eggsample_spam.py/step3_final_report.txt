  "purpose": "Defines plugin hook functions that manipulate data structures for ingredients and condiments.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'ingredients' list and 'condiments' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Potential modification points in 'condiments' dictionary and 'ingredients' list.",
  "flows": "Input data read at source points; modifications occur directly in the data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Insertion of static value 42 into 'condiments' dictionary; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and defines two functions decorated with 'eggsample.hookimpl'. The first function checks for 'egg' in a list and returns a list of spam items accordingly. The second function deletes 'steak sauce' from a dictionary if present, then adds 'spam sauce' with value 42. Both functions modify data passed in memory, with no external network activity or sensitive data handling. The insertion of 42 is unconventional but benign. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior. The minor insertion of 42 does not pose security risks, though it is somewhat unusual.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign plugin logic with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The insertion of 42 is unconventional but harmless. The overall security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero. The reports' scores are consistent with this assessment; only minor adjustments to risk scores could be considered to reflect the low but non-zero risk associated with the static value insertion.",
