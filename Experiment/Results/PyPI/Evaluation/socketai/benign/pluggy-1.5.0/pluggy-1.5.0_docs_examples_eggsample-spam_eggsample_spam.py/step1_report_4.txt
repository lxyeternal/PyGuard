{
  "purpose": "Define hook implementations for the 'eggsample' module, providing ingredient and condiment modifications.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'eggsample' module and receives 'ingredients' and 'condiments' as parameters.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the 'condiments' dictionary directly; no external data or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "flows": "The functions process input parameters ('ingredients' and 'condiments') and return modified lists or strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The use of mutable parameters is typical for plugins.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions decorated with 'eggsample.hookimpl' to modify ingredients and condiments. The first function checks for 'egg' in the input list and returns different spam lists accordingly. The second function deletes an item from the 'condiments' dictionary if it exists and adds 'spam sauce' with a value of 42. The code performs straightforward data manipulation without external data leaks, malicious network activity, or obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements typical plugin hook functions for modifying data; it does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and purposeful within its context.",
