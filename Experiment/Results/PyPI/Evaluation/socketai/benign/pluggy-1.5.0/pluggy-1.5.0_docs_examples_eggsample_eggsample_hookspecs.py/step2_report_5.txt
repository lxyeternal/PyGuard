  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code imports `pluggy` and defines two hook specifications decorated with `@hookspec`.\n- Each function has a descriptive docstring and parameters:\n  - `eggsample_add_ingredients(ingredients: tuple)`\n  - `eggsample_prep_condiments(condiments: dict)`\n- The functions contain no implementation, no data processing, no network calls, no side effects.\n- The code appears to be a straightforward plugin interface setup.\n\n**Assessment of Security and Malicious Indicators:**\n- No data is read from external sources.\n- No data is written to sinks or external systems.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.\n- The code is purely declarative, defining plugin hooks.\n\n**Scores in the Reports:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n- The conclusion in all reports states the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is benign.\n- No reason exists to assign any risk or malware scores above 0.\n- The functions are simply interface definitions, not executable logic.\n- The documentation and structure are standard for plugin systems.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard plugin interface setup with no malicious or risky elements. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.",
