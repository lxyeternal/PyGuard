  "purpose": "Define hook specifications for a plugin system using pluggy for managing ingredients and condiments.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code defines decorators and functions for plugin hooks.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling or processing; functions are simple definitions with no data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares hooks with parameters but no actual data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward hook definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pluggy and creates hook specifications with clear docstrings. No input processing, no data manipulation, no network operations, or other risky behaviors are present. Functions only specify the expected parameters for plugins to implement, without executing logic or handling untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard plugin hook definition setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. Overall, it is a benign component of a plugin system.",
