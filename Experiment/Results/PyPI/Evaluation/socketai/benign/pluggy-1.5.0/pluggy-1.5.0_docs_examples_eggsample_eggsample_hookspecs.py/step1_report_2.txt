  "purpose": "Define hook specifications for a plugin system related to eggsample, involving ingredients and condiments.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only function parameters are used for input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into system effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; functions are only definitions with documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward plugin hook specifications with no signs of unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pluggy' library and defines two hook specifications marked with '@hookspec'. These functions are intended to be implemented by plugins, not to execute malicious code. The functions only accept parameters and return documentation strings. There are no data manipulations, network calls, or other potentially malicious actions. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines plugin interface hooks with no evidence of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscated code. It appears to be standard plugin specification code.",
