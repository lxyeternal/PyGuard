  "purpose": "Define hook specifications for a plugin system related to ingredients and condiments management.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; the code defines functions with parameters but does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, defining hook specifications without any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pluggy' library and creates two hook specifications, 'eggsample_add_ingredients' and 'eggsample_prep_condiments', with clear docstrings. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious behavior present. No input handling, data processing, or network activity is observed that could indicate security issues. The code appears to be part of a plugin architecture setup, which is common and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for plugin hooks without any malicious or suspicious elements. It does not pose security risks.",
