{
  "purpose": "The code defines hook specifications for a plugin system related to an 'eggsample' process, allowing other modules to implement these hooks for adding ingredients and preparing condiments.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present, as the code only defines hooks without executing any data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code consists of standard plugin hook definitions using the 'pluggy' library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pluggy' and creates two hook specifications decorated with 'hookspec'. These specifications serve as interfaces for plugins to implement specific functions. The functions include docstrings describing their intended purpose but contain no executable or potentially malicious logic. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows that could be exploited. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for a plugin system setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup for plugin hook specifications with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It poses no security threat and appears safe.",
