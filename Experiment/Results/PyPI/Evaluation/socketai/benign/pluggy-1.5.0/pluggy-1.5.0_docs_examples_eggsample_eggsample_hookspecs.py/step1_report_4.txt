  "purpose": "Define hook specifications for a plugin system related to ingredients and condiments management.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines functions with parameters but does not read data directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations; no untrusted data handling or system calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions are simply declarations with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pluggy' library to define hook specifications using decorators. It declares two hook functions: 'eggsample_add_ingredients' accepting a tuple, and 'eggsample_prep_condiments' accepting a dictionary. Both functions contain docstrings but no implementation or side effects. There are no external data reads, network calls, or system modifications. The code appears to be standard plugin hook definitions without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign declaration of plugin interface hooks with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as part of a plugin system setup.",
