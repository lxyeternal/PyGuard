  "purpose": "Define plugin hook specifications for eggsample using the pluggy library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; only defines functions with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions are declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pluggy and declares two hook specifications decorated with @hookspec. Both functions contain only docstrings and parameters, serving as plugin interfaces without execution logic. There are no data flows, network activity, or system modifications. The code is simple, clear, and standard for plugin setup, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) and confidence (1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard plugin interface definition with no malicious or security concerns. The reports accurately assess its safety, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
