  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script utilizing SCM versioning. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is an overly cautious default; a score of 0 is justified given the benign nature of the code."
