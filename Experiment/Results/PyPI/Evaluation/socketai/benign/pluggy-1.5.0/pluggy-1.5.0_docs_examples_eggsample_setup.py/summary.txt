  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with a minor configuration issue that does not constitute a security risk. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The low security risk score of approximately 0.1 is appropriate, and all reports are consistent with this evaluation."
