  "purpose": "Define a marker for plugin hooks using the pluggy library.",
  "sources": "Import statement for the 'pluggy' library; assignment of 'hookimpl' using pluggy's HookimplMarker.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pluggy' does not involve data flow; assignment of 'hookimpl' is static and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pluggy's HookimplMarker is standard for plugin systems; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pluggy' library and defines a hook implementation marker 'hookimpl' for the 'eggsample' project. This pattern is typical in plugin-based architectures to mark plugin hook implementations. No dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or malicious behavior detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a standard purpose in setting up plugin hooks with 'pluggy'. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is safe and typical for plugin systems.",
