  "purpose": "Define a marker for plugin hooks using the pluggy library",
  "sources": "Importing the 'pluggy' module, creating a marker with 'pluggy.HookimplMarker'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import of 'pluggy' -> creation of 'hookimpl' marker",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pluggy' library, which is used for plugin management and hooking mechanisms. It then creates a marker 'hookimpl' using 'pluggy.HookimplMarker', intended for plugin implementation markers. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that suggest malicious activity. The code appears to be a standard setup for plugin development and does not perform any actions beyond defining a marker.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward plugin marker setup using the 'pluggy' library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, intentional configuration for plugin system use.",
