  "purpose": "Define a plugin hook implementation marker using the pluggy library.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'pluggy' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pluggy' module does not involve data flows; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pluggy.HookimplMarker' is standard for plugin systems; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pluggy' library and defines a marker 'hookimpl' using 'pluggy.HookimplMarker'. This pattern is common in plugin architecture for registering hook implementations. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external communications. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious constructs. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a plugin system using 'pluggy' and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code for plugin registration.",
