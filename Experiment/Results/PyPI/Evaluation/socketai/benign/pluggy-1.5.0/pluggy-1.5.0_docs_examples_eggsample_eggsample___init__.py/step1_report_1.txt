  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "Import of pluggy -> creation of hookimpl marker.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses a standard pattern for plugin marking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pluggy library, which is a standard plugin management tool. It then creates a marker for plugin implementation using pluggy's HookimplMarker. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical plugin configuration snippet. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behavior. The simplicity and standard library usage reduce the likelihood of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a plugin marker using pluggy, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
