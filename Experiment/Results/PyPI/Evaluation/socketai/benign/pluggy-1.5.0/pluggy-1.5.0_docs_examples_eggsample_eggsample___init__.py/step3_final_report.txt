  "sources": "Import of the 'pluggy' library and creation of 'hookimpl' via pluggy.HookimplMarker(\"eggsample\")",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows present",
  "flows": "Import of 'pluggy' and creation of 'hookimpl' are straightforward; no data flows to untrusted sinks",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal and standard, with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pluggy' library and creates a plugin marker 'hookimpl' using 'pluggy.HookimplMarker'. It is a typical pattern for plugin registration, with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or risky behaviors. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1), which is appropriate given the minimal external dependency usage. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard plugin marker setup with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent. The overall security risk is negligible, and no further action is necessary.",
