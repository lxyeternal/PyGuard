  "purpose": "Define a marker for plugin implementation using the pluggy library",
  "sources": "Import statement for the 'pluggy' library and creation of a marker with 'pluggy.HookimplMarker'",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "None; code only initializes a marker object without data processing or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for plugin marker creation",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pluggy' library and creates a hook implementation marker 'hookimpl' using 'pluggy.HookimplMarker'. The marker is intended for use in plugin systems to mark functions as hook implementations. No input/output handling, data flows, or suspicious activities are present. The code is minimal, standard, and appears to be a typical plugin marker setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a plugin marker using 'pluggy' and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up a marker for plugin development.",
