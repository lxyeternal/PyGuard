{
  "purpose": "This code implements a plugin system using the 'pluggy' library with a hook specification and two plugin implementations performing simple arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the arguments 'arg1' and 'arg2' passed to the 'myhook' method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data beyond performing arithmetic operations; no data leaks or external resource access occurs.",
  "flows": "Input arguments 'arg1' and 'arg2' flow into the 'myhook' implementations, which return results based on arithmetic operations; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with clear structure and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hook specification and two plugin implementations that perform addition and subtraction. The plugin manager registers the plugins and calls the hook with fixed arguments. The code functions as intended without security issues or malicious behavior. The reports provided are empty, indicating no analysis or findings. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The code is benign and correctly implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, free of vulnerabilities, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The empty reports do not identify any issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
