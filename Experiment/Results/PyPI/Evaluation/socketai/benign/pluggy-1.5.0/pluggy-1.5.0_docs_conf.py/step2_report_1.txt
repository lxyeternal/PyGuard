  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The code uses `importlib.metadata` to retrieve the project version, which is a common and safe practice.\n- No untrusted data input, network calls, or data manipulation are present.\n- The logging filter is a benign customization to suppress specific warnings.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is purely configuration-oriented.\n- No dynamic code execution based on untrusted input.\n- The only dynamic aspect is fetching version info via `metadata.version(project)`, which is standard and safe.\n- The filtering of warnings in `configure_logging()` is a benign customization.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, safe Sphinx configuration script.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, supply chain attack, or security risk.\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe configuration script for Sphinx documentation. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
