  "purpose": "Configuration script for setting up Sphinx documentation for the 'pluggy' project.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata, importlib.metadata for version info, and Sphinx application object during setup.",
  "sinks": "Uses metadata.version() for project versioning; no direct sinks for untrusted input or data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Imports metadata to retrieve project version; passes app object to setup functions; configures logging filters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No network calls, data leaks, or malicious payloads detected. Use of importlib.metadata is standard for version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains configuration for documentation generation, with safe usage of libraries. No dynamic execution, no external data input processing, and no suspicious logic. The logging configuration filters out specific warning messages, which is benign. All code appears standard and intended for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only handles setup and logging configuration, with no evidence of malware or supply chain attacks.",
