  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup for the 'pluggy' project.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata for version retrieval, configuration variables, logging filter setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Retrieving version info via metadata.version, logging filter application.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard configuration code with benign customizations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script. It imports standard libraries, retrieves version info safely, and sets configuration options for documentation. The logging filter is a benign customization to suppress specific warnings. No untrusted input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The dynamic version retrieval is a common, safe practice. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. All operations are static or rely on trusted package data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe Sphinx configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
