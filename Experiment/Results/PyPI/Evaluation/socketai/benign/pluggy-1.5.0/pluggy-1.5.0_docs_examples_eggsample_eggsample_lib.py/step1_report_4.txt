{
  "purpose": "The code defines two hook implementation functions for the eggsample module, adding ingredients and modifying condiments.",
  "sources": "Imports the eggsample module; reads data from local variables (ingredients, condiments).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no data leakage or system effects detected.",
  "flows": "The code does not process untrusted input or data flows; functions simply return and modify local variables.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The ingredient lists and modifications appear benign. No obfuscation or malicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module, defines two functions marked with a hook implementation decorator, and manipulates local data structures. The first function creates a list of ingredients including 'salt', 'pepper', and eggs. The second function adds an entry 'mint sauce' to a provided condiments dictionary. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data transmission, or malicious code insertion. The code appears to be a typical plugin or extension pattern with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code review, there are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward, benign, and designed for plugin extension purposes.",
