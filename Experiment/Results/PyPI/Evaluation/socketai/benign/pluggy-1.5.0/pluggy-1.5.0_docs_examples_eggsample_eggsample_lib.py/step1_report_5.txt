{
  "purpose": "Define hook implementation functions for the 'eggsample' plugin or framework, adding ingredients and condiments.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions process static data only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a possibly placeholder or whimsical variable name ('you_can_never_have_enough_eggs'), but no malicious code detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'eggsample' and defines two functions decorated with '@eggsample.hookimpl'. These functions return or modify data structures involving ingredients and condiments. All data appears static and local, with no external input, file access, network operations, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example or placeholder code for a plugin system, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
