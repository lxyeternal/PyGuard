  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `eggsample`.\n- Defines two functions decorated with `@eggsample.hookimpl`.\n- `eggsample_add_ingredients()` creates a list of ingredients (`salt`, `pepper`, `egg`, `egg`) and returns it.\n- `eggsample_prep_condiments(condiments)` adds `'mint sauce': 1` to the passed-in dictionary.\n- No external input, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, no external data flows, and no security issues. This aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code. No logical errors are apparent.\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign such scores; all are zero, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions, correctly noting the code's benign and straightforward nature.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n\n- The code is simple plugin-like code with no external threats or malicious indicators.\n- The variable name `you_can_never_have_enough_eggs` is humorous but benign.\n- No obfuscation, external input, or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound. Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, I concur with the assessments.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.  \n- No further action needed.",
