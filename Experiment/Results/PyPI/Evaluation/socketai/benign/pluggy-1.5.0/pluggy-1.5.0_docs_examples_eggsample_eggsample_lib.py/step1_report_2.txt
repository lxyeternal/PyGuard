{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define hook implementations for a plugin or extension system, likely related to preparing ingredients and condiments.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; all data is hardcoded within the functions.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the 'condiments' dictionary in the 'eggsample_prep_condiments' function, which could be a point of data modification but not necessarily malicious.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only manipulates internal variables and passed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of list concatenation and dictionary modification is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module 'eggsample' and defines two functions decorated with 'eggsample.hookimpl'. The first function constructs an ingredient list by combining spices and eggs, returning it. The second function adds 'mint sauce' to the passed 'condiments' dictionary. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious code behavior, no network activity, and no obfuscation present. The functions are straightforward and serve a culinary preparation context. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and appears to be part of a plugin system related to ingredient handling. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected.",
