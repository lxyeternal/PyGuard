{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package distribution for the 'pydocumentdb' SDK, including reading metadata files and configuring installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.md' and 'changelog.md', importing setup functions, and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; it primarily reads files and configures package setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the process is static package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard setup procedures with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads metadata files with specified encodings, and calls setup() with static parameters. No external input is processed at runtime that could introduce security risks. All actions are standard for package distribution and do not involve executing or injecting code from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It adheres to standard practices without any anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
