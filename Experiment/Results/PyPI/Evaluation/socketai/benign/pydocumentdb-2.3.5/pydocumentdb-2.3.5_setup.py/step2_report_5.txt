  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Describes a standard setup script reading static files and configuring package metadata. No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Clearly states malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0, justified by the absence of any malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; the script is a typical setup script with no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizing static file reading and standard setup process.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, which is very low and acceptable given the static nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as previous, consistent with standard packaging process.\n- Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- Security risk = 0.\n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same consistent analysis, standard setup script.\n- Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- Security risk = 0.\n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, standard package setup.\n- Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- Security risk = 0.\n- Conclusion: No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no suspicious code patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, justified by the static, read-only operations.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and thorough, and the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on all reports and the code review, I agree with the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **risk = 0**. The code is benign, standard, and safe for distribution.",
