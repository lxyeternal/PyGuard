{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the package metadata and dependencies for the 'pydocumentdb' Python SDK, facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' and 'changelog.md' files for long description content.",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sinks; the script primarily reads files and calls setup functions.",
  "flows": "Reads files ('README.md', 'changelog.md') → uses data in setup() function parameters; no untrusted data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or unusual constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads markdown files for description content, and invokes 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package distribution scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, code execution, or data leakage, is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs package configuration and metadata setup.",
