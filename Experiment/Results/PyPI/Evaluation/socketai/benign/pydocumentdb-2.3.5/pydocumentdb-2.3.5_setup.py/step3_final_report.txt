  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'pydocumentdb', configuring metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion.",
  "sources": "Reads static files 'README.md' and 'changelog.md' with specified encoding.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> calls setup() with static parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file reading and package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library. It imports standard modules, reads static documentation files, and invokes setuptools.setup() with predefined parameters. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All dependencies are explicitly declared, and the overall logic is static and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
