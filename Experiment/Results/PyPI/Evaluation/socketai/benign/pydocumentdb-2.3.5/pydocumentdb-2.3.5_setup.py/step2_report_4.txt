  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, no external data injection, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- The code only reads static documentation files ('README.md' and 'changelog.md') and calls `setuptools.setup()` with predefined parameters.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code features are detected across all reports.\n- The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is a typical setup script, with no signs of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The files read are static documentation files, with no indication of untrusted input or external data flow.\n- No suspicious logic, network activity, or code execution is present.\n\n**Score assessments:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard package setup, minimal risk)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured setup script with no security concerns. The high confidence scores across reports are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No changes are needed based on the provided analysis.",
