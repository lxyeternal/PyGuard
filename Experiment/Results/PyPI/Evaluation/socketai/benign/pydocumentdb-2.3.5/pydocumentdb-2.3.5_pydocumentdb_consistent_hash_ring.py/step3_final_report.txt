  "purpose": "Implementation of a consistent hash ring for partitioning in Azure Cosmos DB, mapping collection links and partition keys to nodes using a hashing algorithm.",
  "sources": "Collection links, partition keys, and the hash generator's ComputeHash method.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal data flow from input parameters through hashing and sorting to the returned node or partition list.",
  "flows": "Partition key bytes are hashed, and the resulting hash is used to locate the appropriate partition via lower bound search; collection links are hashed during partition construction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and lacks suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of a consistent hash ring for distributed partitioning. It performs input validation, hashes collection links and partition keys, constructs sorted partitions, and maps keys to nodes without external communication or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls are present. The reliance on an external hash generator is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The logic is clear, and the security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a consistent hash ring for database partitioning, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
