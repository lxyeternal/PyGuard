  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of malicious indicators, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility for making HTTP requests to Cosmos DB, with proper handling of request data, SSL, retries, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code. SSL verification is disabled only for localhost, which is standard for local testing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable given the SSL disablement for localhost, which is a common development practice but could be a security concern if misused.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard request handling with no suspicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code or backdoors. SSL verification is conditionally disabled for localhost, which is typical.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified, considering the SSL disablement for local testing.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard HTTP request management with retries, SSL handling, and data serialization.\n- **Findings:** No malicious indicators. The only noted security concern is the conditional SSL verification disablement based on hostname, which is common in development environments.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — slightly higher than previous due to the SSL disablement, but still acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard request handling with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. SSL verification can be disabled, which is a known risk but not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on request handling, SSL, and response parsing.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity or malicious code. SSL verification is conditionally disabled for localhost, standard in development.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero, justified by the conditional SSL verification disablement for localhost, which could be a security concern if misused but is common in development contexts.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** Considering the SSL disablement for localhost and potential misuse, a moderate risk score of **0.2** seems appropriate. If the environment is strictly production, this could be lower; if development, slightly higher risk is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' assessments are accurate, and their scores are reasonable. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the security risk is minimal but warrants caution regarding SSL verification in development environments.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The risk score could be kept at 0.2, acknowledging the SSL verification conditional disablement as a minor security concern.",
