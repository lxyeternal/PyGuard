{
  "purpose": "The code implements synchronized HTTP requests to interact with Azure Cosmos DB, handling request preparation, SSL configurations, and response processing.",
  "sources": "Input data includes request_data (from function parameter), headers (from function parameter), and request_options (constructed within the code).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP requests using requests_session.request, and response data is processed and potentially returned to the caller. No direct data leakage or untrusted sink manipulation detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request_data to request_body via _RequestBodyFromData, then to _Request, and finally over network through requests_session.request. Response data flows back and is decoded or parsed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs identified. SSL verification is conditionally disabled for localhost, which is standard. Use of json.dumps with separators is normal. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard request handling for Azure Cosmos DB, including data serialization, header preparation, SSL configuration, and response parsing. The functions manage streams, JSON data, and request retries. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. Security considerations such as SSL verification disablement for localhost are typical in development environments. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of HTTP request handling for Azure Cosmos DB interactions, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for request management and error handling.",
