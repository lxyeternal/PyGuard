  "purpose": "Provides a utility for making synchronized HTTP requests to Azure Cosmos DB, handling data serialization, SSL configuration, retries, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads request data (request_data), request options (headers, method, URL), SSL configuration, and response content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include SSL verification toggle (which could be misused), and data serialization (though standard). No direct sinks for malicious data or code execution are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request_data through _RequestBodyFromData to request_body, then into _Request via the requests library, with response data parsed and returned, with no suspicious intermediate steps.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional SSL verification disablement based on hostname ('localhost' or '127.0.0.1')—common in dev environments but a security consideration if misused. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK component for handling HTTP requests to Cosmos DB, with proper data serialization, SSL configuration, and retry logic. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present. The SSL disablement for localhost is typical for development but should be managed carefully in production. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate SDK code, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
