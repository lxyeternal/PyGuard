  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for Cosmos DB resource handling, header creation, URL parsing, and ID extraction. It relies on external modules for authorization and performs standard string manipulations and encoding/decoding.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both scores are 0, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, which is low.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard SDK utility functions with no malicious intent. The decoding functions and URL manipulations are typical, and no suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe; no malware or sabotage suspected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK utility functions, with proper handling of resource links, headers, and encoding. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, still low.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the previous report, no malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and standard.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions for URL parsing, header creation, and resource ID handling. No malicious logic or obfuscation observed.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and standard SDK support code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for headers, URL parsing, encoding, resource identification. Uses external modules for authorization; no malicious code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with proper handling and no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or sabotage detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, safe practices, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** Both 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign SDK utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward, standard SDK utility functions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is transparent, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. The functions mainly manipulate strings, URLs, and headers, which are common in SDK code.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The code is standard SDK utility functions for Cosmos DB, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.\n- The use of external modules for authorization is typical and trusted.\n- The encoding/decoding routines are standard and correctly implemented.\n- No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports; slightly elevated but still low)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code is benign, standard SDK support code with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis indicates a safe, non-malicious codebase, suitable for use in production environments.",
