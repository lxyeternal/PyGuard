{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with Azure Cosmos DB, including generating headers, parsing resource links, encoding/decoding, and resource identification.",
  "sources": "Input data is mainly read from function parameters such as options, resource links, media IDs, and client objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include setting HTTP headers, constructing URLs, and handling resource identifiers and authorization tokens.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., resource links, options, media IDs) flows into URL/ID parsing, header generation, and resource identification functions, culminating in HTTP request headers or resource references.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no use of dynamic code execution; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration. The code appears standard for SDK utility functions. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive set of utility functions for Azure Cosmos DB SDK operations, including header construction with authorization, resource link parsing, and encoding. It uses safe practices such as parameter validation and proper encoding. There are no indications of malicious logic such as backdoors, data theft, or system harm. The only potential concern is the handling of authorization tokens, but it relies on external auth functions, which are standard. No suspicious behavior or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard SDK utility code for Azure Cosmos DB, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior. It safely constructs request headers, parses resource links, and encodes data without risky practices. Overall security risk is minimal.",
