  "purpose": "Utility functions for interacting with Azure Cosmos DB, including request header generation, URL parsing, resource identification, and encoding/decoding operations.",
  "sources": "Reads from input parameters such as resource links, options, headers, and media IDs. Uses environment information like master keys and session tokens from the document client object.",
  "sinks": "Authorization header generation, base64 decoding/encoding, URL quoting, and header assembly which could be misused if input is malicious. No direct data leaks or harmful actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (resource links, options, media IDs) flow into URL parsing, header construction, and encoding/decoding functions. No evident malicious flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of standard libraries for cryptographic functions, URL handling, and UUID generation. The code lacks obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for managing Cosmos DB requests and resource identifiers. It correctly uses existing libraries for security-sensitive operations like UUIDs and base64 encoding. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. Functions like GetAuthorizationHeader are invoked, but their implementation is assumed correct and secure. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external network actions are present. The code's purpose appears to be to facilitate legitimate Cosmos DB SDK operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code intended for Cosmos DB SDK operations. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected. It performs URL manipulations, header preparation, and encoding tasks securely with no evident malicious behavior.",
