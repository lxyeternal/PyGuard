  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, logical correctness, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for Cosmos DB, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The review notes proper handling of encoding, URL parsing, and header generation. The only minor concern is the `DecodeBase64String` replacing '-' with '/' before decoding, which is consistent with certain backend encodings but could cause errors if inputs are malformed.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate. No malware detected, no obfuscation, and the code is standard SDK utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK functions with proper validation and handling. No signs of malicious activity. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score is still reasonable given the functions' nature. No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard utility functions with safe handling of resource links, IDs, and headers. The report emphasizes that the code relies on external modules (like auth) but that is typical. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scores; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe practices, no secrets, no obfuscation, and standard use of libraries. The functions are typical for SDK utilities.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard utility functions with safe handling. No suspicious activity or obfuscation. The risk score remains low.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—simple utility functions for resource handling and header generation. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation techniques.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), but all are very low, which is justified. The code is standard SDK utility code, not exposing any security risks.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs resource URL parsing, header creation, and encoding/decoding operations typical of SDK support libraries.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.\n- The only potential concern is the handling of malformed inputs, but this does not translate into security risks or malware.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to input validation; standard for SDK utility code)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
