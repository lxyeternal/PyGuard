  "purpose": "Internal methods for executing functions in the Azure Cosmos DB database service with retry policies.",
  "sources": "Function parameter passed to _ExecuteFunction; error responses from HTTPFailure exceptions.",
  "sinks": "client.last_response_headers where retry attempt counts and wait times are stored.",
  "flows": "Errors caught in the try-except block lead to retry policy decision; successful function execution returns result.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; execution of arbitrary functions could be risky if untrusted functions are passed, but this is standard for such utility code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard retry mechanism for Cosmos DB SDK operations, handling specific HTTP errors with designated retry policies, updating response headers with retry info, and executing arbitrary functions via a wrapper. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The use of external retry policy classes is typical, assuming they are trustworthy. The execution of arbitrary functions could pose risks if untrusted code is passed, but this is a common pattern in SDK internal utilities. Exception handling and sleep-based retries are standard. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of retry logic for Cosmos DB SDK operations. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
