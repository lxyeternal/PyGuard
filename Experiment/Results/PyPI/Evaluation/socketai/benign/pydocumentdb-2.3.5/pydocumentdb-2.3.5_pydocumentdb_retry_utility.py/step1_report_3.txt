  "purpose": "Internal utility functions for executing database operations in Azure Cosmos DB with retry policies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions, especially 'client', 'global_endpoint_manager', and 'function'; also error responses from HTTP failures.",
  "sinks": "Potential re-throwing of errors, setting of response headers, and sleep calls for retries.",
  "flows": "Function invocation and retries based on exceptions; error handling flow leads to potential retries or exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of sleep for retries is standard. No unusual code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements retry policies for database operations with exception handling based on HTTP status codes. It manages retry attempts, adjusts response headers, and retries operations with delays. The error handling is standard for network retries. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications. It simply manages retries for transient errors and specific HTTP errors. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate internal logic for retrying database requests with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard error handling and retry mechanisms without any malicious behavior.",
