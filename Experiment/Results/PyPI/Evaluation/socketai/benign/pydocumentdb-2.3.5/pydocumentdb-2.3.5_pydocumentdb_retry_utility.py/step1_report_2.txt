  "purpose": "Internal utility functions for executing Azure Cosmos DB functions with retry policies, primarily for handling transient errors and ensuring reliability.",
  "sources": "Imports (pydocumentdb modules, time), function parameters, exception handling for errors.HTTPFailure",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "Function execution flows through _Execute, with error handling and retry logic, but no external or untrusted data flows identified",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard, with retry policies, exception handling, and no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines retry policy application for executing functions with error handling for specific HTTP status codes. It manages response headers and retries upon transient errors or specific forbidden conditions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The use of imported modules is consistent with Azure Cosmos DB client operations. The retry logic and exception handling appear legitimate, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of retry policies for Azure Cosmos DB client functions. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious or malicious code segments, and no evidence of malware. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code appears trustworthy.",
