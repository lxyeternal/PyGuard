  "purpose": "Internal methods for executing functions with retry policies in Azure Cosmos DB service.",
  "sources": "User input or external API responses via function calls, exceptions caught from HTTPFailure errors.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies client.last_response_headers; executes arbitrary functions passed as arguments.",
  "flows": "Function execution calls _ExecuteFunction, which can execute arbitrary code passed as 'function', with retries based on HTTP error responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external retry policies and dynamic execution of arbitrary functions; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements retry logic for HTTP requests with specific handling for error codes (e.g., 403, 429). It dynamically applies retry policies and modifies response headers based on retry attempts. The _ExecuteFunction acts as a wrapper for arbitrary functions, which could theoretically be exploited if untrusted code is passed, but no malicious behavior or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic was identified. The code appears to be a standard retry mechanism with exception handling for API calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of retry policies for Azure Cosmos DB client operations. It does not contain malicious code or sabotage. Use of arbitrary function execution is typical for such wrappers but could pose risk if misused externally, which is outside the scope here. Overall, no malware or malicious behavior detected.",
