{
  "purpose": "The code provides internal methods for executing functions within the Azure Cosmos DB service with retry policies applied.",
  "sources": "Input parameters include client, global_endpoint_manager, and function, as well as *args and **kwargs for function arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; the code primarily calls external functions and manages retries based on exceptions.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (client, global_endpoint_manager, function, args) are used to execute _ExecuteFunction, which is called within a retry loop that handles specific HTTP failures, applying retry policies and potentially waiting between retries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are observed. The code relies on external retry policy classes and standard sleep for retries. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. All imported modules are related to Azure Cosmos DB SDK.",
  "analysis": "The code implements retry logic for Azure Cosmos DB operations, handling specific HTTP errors with designated policies. It uses standard exception handling and sleep calls for retries. The imported modules and method names are consistent with typical SDK functionality. No suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code, are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of retry policies, with no embedded malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical retry wrapper for Azure Cosmos DB SDK functions, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It manages retries for certain HTTP errors using defined policies, with no evidence of security issues or sabotage.",
