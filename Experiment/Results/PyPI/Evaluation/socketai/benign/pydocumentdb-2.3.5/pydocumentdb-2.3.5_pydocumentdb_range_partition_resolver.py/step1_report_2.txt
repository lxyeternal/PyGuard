{
  "purpose": "Implement range-based partition resolution for Azure Cosmos DB, allowing documents to be assigned to partitions based on key ranges and facilitating read/query operations across partitions.",
  "sources": "partition_key_extractor parameter, document input in ResolveForCreate method, partition_key in ResolveForRead, internal methods accessing partition_map and range objects.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is being written or sent over network or to external systems.",
  "flows": "The partition_key_extractor is called with documents to produce a key, which then determines the containing range; ranges are checked for containment or intersection within internal methods, and the results are used to return collection links.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls are present. The code relies on external range objects and a user-supplied extractor, which are normal for such implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for range-based partition resolution, utilizing provided ranges and a key extractor. It performs input validation, range containment, and intersection checks. No suspicious or malicious logic, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The implementation appears standard for a partition resolver. It depends on external range objects and a key extractor function but does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard range partition resolver for Cosmos DB without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or suspicious logic. It appears to be a legitimate, purpose-specific component for data partitioning.",
