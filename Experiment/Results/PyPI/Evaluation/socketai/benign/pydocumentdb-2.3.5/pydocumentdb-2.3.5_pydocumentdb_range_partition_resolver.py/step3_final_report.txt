  "purpose": "Range partition resolver implementation for distributing data across partitions based on range keys in Azure Cosmos DB.",
  "sources": "Partition key extraction function, external 'prange.Range' objects in the partition_map.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; primarily internal range checks and lookups.",
  "flows": "Input document or partition key -> range containment/intersection checks -> selection of collection links.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard range containment and intersection logic using external 'prange' objects, with input validation and straightforward data routing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious external dependencies are present. The reliance on external range objects is typical for such implementations. No external data exfiltration, network calls, or hidden logic are evident. The code's purpose is legitimate, and the structure is clear and well-defined.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a range-based partition resolver for Cosmos DB. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk is minimal. Minor adjustments to the risk score from moderate to low would better reflect the benign nature.",
