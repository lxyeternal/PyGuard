  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malware. The code is a straightforward implementation of a range partition resolver, with standard range containment and intersection logic. No external network or data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, purpose-specific, and well-structured.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious logic. Uses standard range operations and a user-provided key extractor.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the report.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent detected; implementation seems legitimate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Also similar—standard range resolution logic, external range objects, no suspicious code, no external network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware is 0, security risk is 0.1 (slightly above zero, but very low), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; the minor security risk score likely reflects the minimal external dependency on range objects.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard implementation, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior, relies on external range library.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent, legitimate code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with others—no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, standard logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence of malware:** No, all reports agree on benign behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily due to external dependencies and minimal external exposure.\n- **Malware score justification:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with the analysis)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a range-based partition resolver for Cosmos DB, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes needed to the scores. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
