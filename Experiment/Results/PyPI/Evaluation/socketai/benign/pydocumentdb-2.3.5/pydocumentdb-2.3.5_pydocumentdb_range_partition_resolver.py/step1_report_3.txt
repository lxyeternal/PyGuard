  "purpose": "Implementation of a range-based partition resolver for Azure Cosmos DB, enabling data distribution and query routing based on partition key ranges.",
  "sources": "Partition key extractor function, document input, partition_map dictionary",
  "sinks": "Return values from ResolveForCreate and ResolveForRead methods, _GetContainingRange and _GetIntersectingRanges internal logic",
  "flows": "partition_key_extractor → _GetContainingRange / _GetIntersectingRanges → return collection links",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Use of exceptions is standard. No obfuscated code detected. No network, system calls, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for partition resolution based on range overlaps, primarily handling input validation, range containment, and intersection checks. It relies on external 'pydocumentdb.range' module for range objects. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The logic appears standard for partition resolution in a database context, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a range partition resolver for Cosmos DB. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of external range objects and straightforward logic support its benign purpose.",
