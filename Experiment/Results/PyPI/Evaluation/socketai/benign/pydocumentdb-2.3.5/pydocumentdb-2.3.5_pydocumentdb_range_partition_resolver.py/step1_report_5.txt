{
  "purpose": "Implement a range-based partition resolver for Azure Cosmos DB, handling document distribution across partitions based on key ranges.",
  "sources": "Partition key extractor function, document input, partition_map dictionary, and partition_key parameter in ResolveForRead.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no direct output of untrusted data to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Partition key is extracted from document → _GetContainingRange finds the range containing the key → ResolveForCreate returns associated collection link → For read, _GetIntersectingRanges finds all ranges intersecting with partition key → returns list of collection links.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls. Use of external library pydocumentdb.range is typical for Cosmos DB range operations. No unusual code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for range-based partition resolution in Cosmos DB, with methods for resolving partition information for create and read operations. It includes input validation, range containment and intersection checks, and returns appropriate collection links. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious data manipulation are present. The code relies on an external range library and standard data structures, with no apparent malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a range partition resolver for Cosmos DB with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
