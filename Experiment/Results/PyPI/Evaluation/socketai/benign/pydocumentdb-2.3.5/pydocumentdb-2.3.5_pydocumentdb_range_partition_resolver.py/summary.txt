  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a range-based partition resolver for Cosmos DB. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk is minimal. Minor adjustments to the risk score from moderate to low would better reflect the benign nature."
