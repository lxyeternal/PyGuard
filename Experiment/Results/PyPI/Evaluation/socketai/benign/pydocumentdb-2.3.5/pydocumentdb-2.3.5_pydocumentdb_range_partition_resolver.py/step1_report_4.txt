  "purpose": "Implementation of range-based partition resolution for Azure Cosmos DB, facilitating document distribution and querying across partitions.",
  "sources": "partition_key_extractor parameter, document parameter, self.partition_map, method inputs (partition_key, document)",
  "sinks": "Return values (collection links), exception raising for invalid inputs",
  "flows": "Input parameters (document or partition_key) pass through extractor and range-check functions, leading to retrieval from partition_map",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Code appears standard for a partition resolver.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard range partition resolver with methods to resolve data placement and retrieval based on range overlaps. It uses safe input validation, proper range intersection logic, and standard Python data structures. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code’s logic and structure are consistent with a legitimate purpose of partition resolution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical range partition resolver for Azure Cosmos DB, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on provided inputs, range objects, and dictionary lookups, with no external network interactions or hidden behaviors.",
