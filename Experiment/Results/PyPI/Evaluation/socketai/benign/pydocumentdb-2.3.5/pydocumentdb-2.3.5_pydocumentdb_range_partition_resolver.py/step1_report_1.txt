  "purpose": "Implementation of a range-based partition resolver for Azure Cosmos DB to distribute data across partitions.",
  "sources": "partition_key_extractor (function parameter), document input, partition_map (dictionary of ranges), internal methods accessing partition_map and range objects.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as data flows primarily within the class for resolving partitioning; no external or network sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (document or partition_key) is processed through range containment or intersection logic to determine the appropriate partition(s) based on range objects; no external data exfiltration or command execution flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors; the code adheres to standard partitioning logic without obfuscated or hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for range-based partition resolution in a database context, utilizing safe data structures and logic. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling is present. Range operations depend on the 'prange' library, which appears standard. All methods perform predictable operations related to range containment and intersection, with input validation and error handling. There are no network calls, file operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code is clean, well-structured, and intended solely for partition resolution logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard partition resolution functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate data partitioning tasks within Cosmos DB. No malware, suspicious data flows, or security risks are detected.",
