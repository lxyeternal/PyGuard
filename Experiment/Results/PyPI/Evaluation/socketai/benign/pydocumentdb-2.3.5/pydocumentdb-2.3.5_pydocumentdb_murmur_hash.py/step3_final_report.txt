  "purpose": "Implementation of MurmurHash3 (32-bit x86 version) for hashing data within a larger system, such as Azure Cosmos DB.",
  "sources": "Input data read from the 'key' parameter (byte array).",
  "sinks": "Hash computation steps; no external sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'key' parameter through hashing functions, culminating in a bytearray output of the hash value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a standard, well-documented MurmurHash3 implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python implementation of MurmurHash3, with clear structure and comments. It processes input data, performs known hashing steps, and returns a hash as a bytearray. No network activity, environment variable access, or malicious constructs are present. The code aligns with standard hashing algorithms, and the logic is correct. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected. The security implications are minimal, as it is a utility function, not a security vulnerability or attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of MurmurHash3 with no malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
