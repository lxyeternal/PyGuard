{
  "purpose": "Implementation of MurmurHash3 hashing algorithm, intended for internal use within the Azure Cosmos DB service.",
  "sources": "Reads only the input parameter 'key' for hashing; no external data sources or user inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "Produces a bytearray as output; no sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'key' flows through hash computation functions, resulting in a hash value; no external or untrusted data is transmitted or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard implementation of MurmurHash3 without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, standard implementation of the MurmurHash3 algorithm in Python. It includes proper hashing functions, handling of tail bytes, and bitwise operations. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code is well-commented, and there are no signs of malicious logic such as backdoors, data theft, or hidden behavior. It appears to be a benign hashing utility, meant for internal hashing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of MurmurHash3 hashing algorithm with no signs of malicious activity. It is likely safe and intended solely for hashing purposes within the application.",
