{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, and resource types used in Azure Cosmos DB operations, serving as a utility module for SDK or API interaction.",
  "sources": "Constant class definitions and string assignments, mostly static data; no input sources or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions that handle untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident, as this module only contains static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected. The code appears purely declarative with well-known constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of constant definitions for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, error codes, and resource types relevant to Azure Cosmos DB. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic behavior. All values are static, and the structure follows standard SDK design patterns. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code does not perform any data processing or external communication. It appears to be a standard constants module used for building or interpreting Cosmos DB REST API requests/responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static reference for various Cosmos DB-related constants. It does not contain malware or security risks. It is well-structured, and no malicious behavior or sabotage signals are evident.",
