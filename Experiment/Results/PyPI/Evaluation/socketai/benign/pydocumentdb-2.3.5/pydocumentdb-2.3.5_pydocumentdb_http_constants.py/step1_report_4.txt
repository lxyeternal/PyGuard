{
  "purpose": "Define constants for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, error codes, query strings, and resource types used in Azure Cosmos DB SDK.",
  "sources": "Constants are hardcoded as class attributes and string literals; no external data input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or lead to security issues; no functions or data handling beyond constant definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code only defines constants without executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. The code strictly defines static constants with no obfuscated or dynamic code elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of constant definitions related to HTTP protocol, headers, status codes, error codes, and resource identifiers for Azure Cosmos DB SDK. No dynamic execution, external data inputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. It serves as a static reference module for the SDK's internal use. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining constants for SDK functionality, with no malicious or security-compromising elements present. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or network activity. Overall security risk is negligible.",
