{
  "purpose": "This code provides constant definitions for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, error codes, resource types, and related configurations used in Azure Cosmos DB's Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions are hardcoded within classes and variables; no external data sources are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data handling that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or untrusted data propagation paths; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions with constants used for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, error codes, resource types, and other configuration parameters. These are typical for SDK development to standardize request/response handling. There are no external data inputs, no code execution logic, nor any suspicious patterns that could indicate malicious behavior. The initial comments contain licensing information, not malicious code. The constants are well-organized and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of constant definitions for the Azure Cosmos DB Python SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe to use and is intended for internal SDK use only.",
