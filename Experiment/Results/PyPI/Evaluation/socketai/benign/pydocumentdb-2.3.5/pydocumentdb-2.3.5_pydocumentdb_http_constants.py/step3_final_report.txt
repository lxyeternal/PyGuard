{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of constants for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, error codes, resource types, query strings, and related configurations used in the Azure Cosmos DB Python SDK. It serves as a static utility module to standardize and facilitate SDK development and API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined string literals and class attributes representing constants; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only declares constants without dynamic data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no executable logic or data processing pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is well-structured, commented, and standard for SDK utility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of class-based constants for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, error codes, resource types, query strings, and other configuration parameters. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or executable logic. The constants are straightforward string literals, and the structure is clear and well-documented. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is intended for internal SDK use, facilitating consistent API interactions. The absence of dynamic or external data processing indicates a negligible security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constants module used within the Azure Cosmos DB SDK. It poses no security threats, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and is structurally sound. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with its content.",
