{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants and classes for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, query strings, error codes, and resource types related to Azure Cosmos DB, primarily for internal use within SDK or API implementations.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads from static class attributes and string constants; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that execute commands, write to files, or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines constants used elsewhere in the system.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward collection of constants and static class definitions. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden logic is present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of constant definitions for use in an SDK or API layer interacting with Azure Cosmos DB. It includes HTTP method names, header names, status codes, query string parameters, error codes, and resource type identifiers. No dynamic or user-input handling is present. The code is well-structured, commented, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. It appears to serve as a utility module for other parts of the software.\n\nNo signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. There are no unusual patterns, code injection points, or secret data. The code's design and content are typical for a constants module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of constants used for SDK or API interactions with Azure Cosmos DB. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious data, and no malware indicators. The overall security risk is minimal, and the likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
