{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants and configuration parameters for Azure Cosmos DB HTTP interactions, including headers, status codes, and resource types, likely to be used across a Python SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, query strings, error codes, and resource types.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no code execution or data handling logic present that could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or logic; purely static definitions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is well-structured and standard for SDK definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive collection of constant values used for HTTP communication with Azure Cosmos DB services. It includes method names, header names, status descriptions, query string parameters, error codes, and resource type identifiers. All are static and straightforward, with no code execution or data manipulation present. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The absence of logic means there are no potential flow vulnerabilities. It appears to be a benign module intended for SDK or client application use, providing structured constants for HTTP interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of constant definitions for use in an Azure Cosmos DB SDK or client library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. Its purpose is purely for defining static parameters, with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
