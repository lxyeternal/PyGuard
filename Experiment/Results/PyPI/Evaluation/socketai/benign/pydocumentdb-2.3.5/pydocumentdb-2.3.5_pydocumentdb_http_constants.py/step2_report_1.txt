  "review": "Let's systematically analyze these reports and the provided code.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is purely static, defining constants for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, error codes, resource types, etc.\n- No dynamic code, data handling, input processing, or executable logic is present.\n- No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is a static constants module with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n---\n\n**2. Logical Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is a benign collection of constants.\n- No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Given the static, well-structured, and standard nature of the code, these scores are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, indicating no risk.\n- Since the code is just constants with no executable or dynamic behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration:**\n- No malicious activity is present.\n- No signs of backdoors, hidden payloads, or malicious code.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**6. Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No need to challenge any claims, as none are made about vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n- The scores reflect the static, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated nature accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a straightforward collection of constants used in SDK development.  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.  \n- No dynamic or external data handling occurs.  \n- The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is safe, standard, and intended solely for internal use within the SDK. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is benign, and the security assessment is correct.",
