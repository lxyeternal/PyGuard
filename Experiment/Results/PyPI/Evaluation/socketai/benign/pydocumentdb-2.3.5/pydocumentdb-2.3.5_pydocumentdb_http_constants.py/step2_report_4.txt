  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, security risks, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static constants, class definitions, and string literals used for SDK or API interactions.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, or external data sources are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hidden payloads, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly to define constants for HTTP methods, headers, status codes, resource types, etc.\n- The code is well-structured, commented, and typical for SDK utility modules.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No. All reports confirm the code is static, with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors, flaws, or mistakes are noted; the code is straightforward and correct.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risks as 0, which aligns with the content.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, static nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- The code is purely static constants with no external inputs or executable logic.\n- No backdoors, secret keys, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The purpose is for SDK internal use, not exposed to untrusted sources directly.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard constants module for Azure Cosmos DB SDK.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, confirming the code's benign nature.",
