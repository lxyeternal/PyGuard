  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step to determine if they are accurate and consistent with the code, and to assess the actual security risk.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a static collection of constants and class definitions related to HTTP methods, headers, status codes, error codes, resource types, and configuration parameters for Azure Cosmos DB SDK. There are no dynamic elements, no external data handling, and no executable logic that could be malicious. The code is purely declarative.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is a benign constants module, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. There are no logical flaws or reasoning errors in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and well-structured.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is justified. There are no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors present.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher than 0.5**  \nNo report suggests a risk higher than 0.5, and given the static, well-documented nature of the code, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims about Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as a constants definition module with no dynamic or executable parts.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the code content. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign, static constants module with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent with the code. They correctly identify the nature of the code as safe and non-malicious. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms that the code is safe and should be considered benign.",
