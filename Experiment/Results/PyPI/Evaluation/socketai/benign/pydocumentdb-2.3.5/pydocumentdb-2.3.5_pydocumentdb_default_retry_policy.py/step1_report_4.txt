{
  "purpose": "Implement a retry policy for handling connection reset and other network errors in Azure Cosmos DB client.",
  "sources": "The class _DefaultRetryPolicy reads error codes from the imported http_constants module, and accesses method and headers information from the args parameter passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The class's methods determine whether to retry operations based on error codes and request details, influencing network request behavior.",
  "flows": "Error codes are checked in needsRetry method; decision to retry depends on current attempt count and error code validity; ShouldRetry uses these to decide whether to retry based on exception's status code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of retry logic, with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a retry policy class that handles network error codes associated with connection issues, specifically in a Cosmos DB client context. It imports error codes from a standard module, utilizes internal class attributes to manage retry attempts, and checks error codes to decide on retrying. The logic for retrying depends on error codes and request method or headers, which is a typical pattern in network request handling. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. The code functions as a standard network retry mechanism, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a network retry policy for Cosmos DB connection errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious component for managing retries in network communication.",
