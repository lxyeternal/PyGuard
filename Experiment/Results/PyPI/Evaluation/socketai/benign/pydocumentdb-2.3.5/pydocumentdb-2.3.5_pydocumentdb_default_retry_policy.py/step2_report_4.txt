  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it implements a retry policy based on error codes and request attributes.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No significant flaws; the code is straightforward. The only minor concern is that 'args' is unvalidated, which could cause runtime errors, but this does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0. The low security risk score seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected; the code is a standard retry policy.\n- **Overall:** Safe, legitimate retry logic.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code is typical network error handling.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern; the code handles network errors with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, standard retry pattern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, consistent with previous reports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same analysis; standard retry logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a standard implementation of a retry policy for network errors.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** All report scores indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1 to 0.2), consistent with a non-malicious retry handler.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical, straightforward retry policy for handling network errors in a cloud SDK.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to potential runtime errors due to unvalidated 'args', but not security-related)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and functions as intended for its purpose. No malicious or security-threatening elements are present.",
