  "purpose": "Implementation of a retry policy for handling connection errors in Azure Cosmos DB service interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports pydocumentdb.http_constants and uses error codes from it; reads error_code in needsRetry method; reads self.args and self.current_retry_attempt_count; accesses exception.status_code.",
  "sinks": "Returns boolean values indicating whether to retry, potentially influencing control flow based on error codes and request method headers.",
  "flows": "error_code in needsRetry -> return True/False based on checks; ShouldRetry -> increments retry count and returns True/False based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard retry logic; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code; no external data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a retry policy class that handles connection errors based on predefined error codes. It inspects error codes and request headers to decide whether to retry. The class maintains a retry count and enforces a maximum limit. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. It functions as a typical network error handling mechanism within a cloud service client SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard connection retry policy with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It is legitimate and aligns with common retry patterns used in network communication libraries.",
