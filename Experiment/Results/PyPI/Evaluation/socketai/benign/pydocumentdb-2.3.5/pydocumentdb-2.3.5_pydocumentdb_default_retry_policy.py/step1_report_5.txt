  "purpose": "Internal class for implementing connection reset retry policy in Azure Cosmos DB service to handle retry logic on specific error codes.",
  "sources": "Imports pydocumentdb.http_constants and accesses error codes; reads method and headers from self.args to determine retry conditions; processes exception status_code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially influences retry behavior based on error codes and request attributes, which could affect network behavior but does not directly leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Error code from exception -> needsRetry method checks error code against known list -> shouldRetry method decides to retry based on attempt count and error type.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; code primarily performs conditional retry logic based on known error codes and request attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a retry policy class that handles specific Windows and Linux network error codes. It checks whether to retry based on error codes and request method/headers, and limits retry attempts. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The logic is consistent with typical retry patterns for network operations. The code does not execute untrusted data or contain obfuscated elements. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of retry logic, not malicious or harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard retry policy for network errors in an Azure Cosmos DB context. It performs conditional retries based on error codes and request attributes without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
