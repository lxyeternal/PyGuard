  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a class implementing a retry policy based on error codes, request method, and headers.\n- It imports error codes from an external module (`pydocumentdb.http_constants`) and uses them to determine whether to retry.\n- The logic involves simple condition checks and counters, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, legitimate, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and functions as intended. No errors or flaws are evident.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** The code's purpose is limited to retry logic, which inherently poses minimal security risk.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made that could lead to vulnerabilities. The only concern could be unvalidated `args`, but this doesn't lead to malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the context, the overall security risk is low, around 0.1–0.2, which is consistent with the reports.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0.1–0.2, which seems appropriate.\n- The malware score is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9–1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (low, legitimate retry logic)\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard implementation of a retry policy for network errors, with no malicious or security-compromising elements. The scores given in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is legitimate, straightforward, and safe.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The overall security posture is low risk, with no malware detected.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action required.",
