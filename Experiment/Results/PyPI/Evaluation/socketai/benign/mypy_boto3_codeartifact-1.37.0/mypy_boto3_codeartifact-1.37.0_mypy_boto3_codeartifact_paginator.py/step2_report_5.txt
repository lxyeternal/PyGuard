  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 CodeArtifact, sourced from standard libraries and type defs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The 'paginate' methods pass **kwargs** directly to boto3's paginator functions without validation or processing—standard pattern.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, inheriting from boto3 classes, with documentation links.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is correct; the code is benign, standard, and purely for type safety.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard pattern, type annotations, and safe delegation to boto3.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors.\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign, with high confidence.\n- Scores are appropriate: no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Repeats the pattern of standard boto3 paginator class definitions.\n- No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- The analysis is accurate; the code is a benign, type-safe wrapper.\n- Scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Also correctly identifies the code as standard paginator class definitions with type annotations.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- The code is purely for type safety and documentation, with no malicious activity.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, describing the code as type annotations and paginator classes for boto3.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The analysis correctly concludes the code is benign.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Presence:** The code matches the description: class definitions inheriting from boto3's Paginator, with 'paginate' methods forwarding **kwargs**.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** None detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or external system calls.\n- **Obfuscation:** None. The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0 to malware and risk, which is justified.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — standard SDK wrapper, no security risks.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a typical, type-annotated, class-based wrapper around boto3 paginator classes.\n- The use of conditional import for 'Unpack' is standard for compatibility.\n- The 'paginate' methods do not perform any processing beyond forwarding parameters, which is expected for such SDK wrapper code.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' conclusions: the code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.**",
