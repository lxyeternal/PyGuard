{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 CodeArtifact client, facilitating paginated API calls with proper type checking and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Code reads from imported modules, type definitions, sys.version_info for Python version, and function parameters for paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept untrusted keyword arguments (**kwargs), which are unpacked into request types; no direct untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source: **kwargs in paginate methods -> Unpack into request types -> Call to parent Paginator.paginate -> Return PageIterator with result type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. All class and method definitions are standard, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of sys.version_info for conditional import is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for boto3's CodeArtifact service, with type annotations, documentation links, and conditional import based on Python version. All classes inherit from Paginator with specific result types. The paginate methods simply pass through unpacked arguments to the parent class. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic detected. The code is purely for type safety, documentation, and structured API interaction.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured type annotation layer for boto3 paginators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to standard patterns for such SDK wrappers and does not include any malicious actions or backdoors.",
