  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the CodeArtifact service client in boto3, providing structured pagination capabilities for various API calls.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules (__future__, sys, typing, typing_extensions), boto3's paginator base classes, and type definitions imported from .type_defs.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods, which accept **kwargs** unpacked from specific request types, could potentially accept untrusted input but are simply passing through parameters to the underlying boto3 paginator functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are received by the 'paginate' methods and forwarded directly to boto3's paginator functions without any processing or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code strictly defines paginator classes with type annotations, following standard patterns. No obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or malicious system calls are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, class definitions inheriting from boto3 paginator classes, and method implementations that pass keyword arguments to the underlying boto3 methods. The conditional import for 'Unpack' ensures compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious functionality. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard implementation of paginator classes with type hints and documentation links. All code flows simply delegate to boto3's existing paginator infrastructure without any data processing or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of paginator classes with type annotations for the boto3 CodeArtifact client. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It primarily serves as a type-safe wrapper around boto3's paginator functionality, with clear documentation links and no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
