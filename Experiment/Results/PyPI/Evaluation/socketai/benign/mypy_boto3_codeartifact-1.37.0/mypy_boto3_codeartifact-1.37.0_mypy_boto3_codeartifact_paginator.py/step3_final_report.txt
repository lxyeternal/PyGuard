  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 CodeArtifact paginators, providing structured, type-safe wrappers for pagination methods.",
  "sources": "Standard boto3 paginator classes, type definition imports, and method parameters (kwargs).",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs** and pass them directly to boto3's paginator functions without validation or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Source: method call with **kwargs** -> sink: passing **kwargs** into boto3 paginator's 'paginate' method.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward, inheriting from boto3 classes, with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from boto3's Paginator, with 'paginate' methods that forward **kwargs** unprocessed. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code is a standard pattern for type annotations and SDK wrappers, with documentation links. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of boto3 paginator wrappers with type annotations. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
