{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS CodeArtifact service client, enabling type-safe pagination in Python for various listing operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and function definitions, imports from 'sys', 'typing', and 'botocore.paginate', as well as type definitions from '.type_defs'.",
  "sinks": "The code defines methods that accept **kwargs for pagination parameters and return PageIterator objects; no untrusted data sources or output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' methods receive pagination parameters via **kwargs, utilizing type definitions for request parameters, and produce PageIterator objects that iterate over the results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code is structured as standard boto3 paginator wrapper with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines paginator classes for each list operation of the CodeArtifact client, with proper type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and standard method overrides. It relies on established libraries and patterns for paginators without any signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No external or untrusted data handling, command execution, or network calls are embedded within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily enhances type safety and usability for the AWS SDK pagination mechanisms.",
