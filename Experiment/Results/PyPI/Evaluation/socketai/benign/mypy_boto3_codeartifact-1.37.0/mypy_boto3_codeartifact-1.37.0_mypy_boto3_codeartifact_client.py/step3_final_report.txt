  "purpose": "Static type annotations and client class definitions for the boto3 CodeArtifact SDK, serving as type hints for IDEs and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard modules, botocore, and local modules; class and method signatures with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; purely static definitions without runtime data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow or runtime logic; only method signatures and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of type annotations, placeholders ('...'), and **kwargs unpacking with external type definitions; no executable code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive static type stub for the boto3 CodeArtifact client, providing type hints for IDE support and static analysis. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or network calls. The use of **kwargs with external type definitions could be a vector if those definitions are malicious, but within this code, no such malicious activity exists. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves solely as an interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate static type stub for the AWS SDK's CodeArtifact client. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The minimal risk stems from reliance on external type definitions, not from the code itself.",
