  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for AWS CodeArtifact service, facilitating static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore modules, and local modules (.paginator, .type_defs). Method parameters via **kwargs unpacked from various request type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could enter via method parameters (**kwargs) or environment variables (sys.version_info). Output is primarily API responses and generated URLs. No direct sinks for sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input (kwargs) to API method calls, which generate responses or URLs. No evidence of data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The code consists of interface definitions, method signatures, and type annotations only. No dynamic execution, code injection, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines a client class for AWS CodeArtifact with method signatures matching the official boto3 API, enriched with detailed type annotations and overloads for paginators. The class facilitates static type checking and IDE support. No code executes untrusted input or performs suspicious operations. The import statements adapt to Python version differences but do not pose security issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, type-annotated interface for AWS SDK interaction, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It strictly defines client methods, type annotations, and paginator overloads. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
