{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the Python boto3 CodeArtifact service, enabling type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and overload annotations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; code primarily defines type hints, class structures, and method signatures without executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class structure and method signatures for external API calls, but does not contain executable logic or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive type annotations, overloads, and placeholders (e.g., '...') but no executable or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a type stub implementation providing type annotations for boto3's CodeArtifact client, including exception class definitions, client class with method signatures, and property overloads. It imports standard modules, botocore components, and local modules for request and response types. No runtime logic, data processing, or external calls are present. The code appears to serve as a static type hinting aid, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive type stub for the CodeArtifact client, focused solely on type annotations and class structures. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or sabotage. The code's purpose is to improve static analysis and IDE support without executing or manipulating data. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
