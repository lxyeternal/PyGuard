{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-codeartifact package, used to configure package metadata and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; no other data sources or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations; primarily static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path and setuptools for package setup, reads a Markdown file for description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. The code structure is straightforward, with no external data inputs beyond static file reading. No network calls, no eval or exec statements, and no use of potentially dangerous functions. All data appears to be static and intended for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs typical package configuration tasks with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
