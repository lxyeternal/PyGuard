  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-codeartifact' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A – no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. It imports necessary modules, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, classifiers, dependencies, and URLs. No input/output from external or untrusted sources is handled dynamically. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The script does not contain hardcoded secrets, code injection, or obfuscated logic. It adheres to typical packaging standards, with all dependencies explicitly listed and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign setup script for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears safe for use and distribution.",
