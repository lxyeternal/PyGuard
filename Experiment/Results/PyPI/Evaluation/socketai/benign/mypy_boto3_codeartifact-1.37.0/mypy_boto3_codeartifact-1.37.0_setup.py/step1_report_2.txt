  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-codeartifact package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package metadata definitions; importing setup from setuptools; no dynamic input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from code variables into setup() arguments; no untrusted data flow from input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, importing only necessary modules, defining static package metadata, and calling setup() with this data. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, nor any data transmission or malicious logic. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
