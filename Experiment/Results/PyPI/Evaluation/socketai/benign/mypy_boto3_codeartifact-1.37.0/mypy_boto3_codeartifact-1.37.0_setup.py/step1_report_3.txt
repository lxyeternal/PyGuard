  "purpose": "Setup script for publishing the mypy-boto3-codeartifact package with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths for README.md and uses hardcoded package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; mainly static configuration and file reading.",
  "flows": "File path reading flows into the package description; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the project description from a local file and defines package metadata for setup. All data appears static and intended for package distribution. No user input, network access, or dynamic code execution is present. The use of standard setup tools and typical configuration indicates no malicious intent. No suspicious patterns or security issues are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
