  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script that outputs package information or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (outputs information), potentially affected if data is manipulated before printing",
  "flows": "User inputs in sys.argv -> main() function -> print_version() or print_info() -> sys.stdout.write()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no dynamic code execution; straightforward print functions; no external data sources or network connections.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple command-line interface that outputs static package info or version. It only reads command-line arguments and writes fixed strings to stdout. No user input is processed other than command-line flags, and there are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code structure and format are simple and standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script designed to display package information or version number. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
