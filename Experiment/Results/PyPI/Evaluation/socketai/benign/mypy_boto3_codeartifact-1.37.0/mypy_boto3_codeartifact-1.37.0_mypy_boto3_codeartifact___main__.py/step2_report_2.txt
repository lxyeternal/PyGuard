  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that:\n     - Checks for the `--version` argument.\n     - Prints version info if present.\n     - Otherwise, prints static package info.\n   - No external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or credential handling.\n   - Uses only standard library (`sys`) with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is static and does not perform any malicious operations.\n\n2. **Report Analysis:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They note the absence of obfuscation, dynamic code, external calls, or secrets.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0), and all scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and straightforward)\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious behavior detected)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The code is very simple and static; there's no reason to assign any risk above zero.\n   - The reports are consistent and justified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code could be slightly improved by using `print()` instead of `sys.stdout.write()`, but this does not impact security.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational; no vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or behavior detected.                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and unobfuscated.           |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or risky operations present. |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, simple CLI utility.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual behavior.",
