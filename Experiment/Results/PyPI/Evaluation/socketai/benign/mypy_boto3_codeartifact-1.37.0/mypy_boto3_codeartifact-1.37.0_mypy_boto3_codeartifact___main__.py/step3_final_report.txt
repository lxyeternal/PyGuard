{
  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via command-line interface.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to determine output; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output (`sys.stdout.write`), no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument as source; outputs version info as sink; otherwise outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static information based on command-line input. It uses only the standard library (`sys`) and performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. The functions are minimal, with clear control flow. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's purpose is purely informational, and the implementation is safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
