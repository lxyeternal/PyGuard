  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that prints static package info or version based on a command-line argument (`--version`).\n   - It uses only the `sys` module for input/output.\n   - No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or credential handling.\n   - No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no external dependencies beyond standard library.\n   - The code is straightforward, with clear, static output functions.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Findings:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - They note the absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, external data sources, or network activity.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0), and no anomalies or security risks are identified.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. There is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is static and simple, no reason exists to adjust scores upward.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, malware, or security issues.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a straightforward, safe CLI utility with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
