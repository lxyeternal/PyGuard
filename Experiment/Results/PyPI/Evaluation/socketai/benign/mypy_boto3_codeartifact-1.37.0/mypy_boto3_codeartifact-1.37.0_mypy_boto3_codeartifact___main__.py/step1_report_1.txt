  "flows": "Reads sys.argv for '--version' flag → Calls print_version() or print_info() → Outputs data to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected. The code performs straightforward informational output.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that checks for a '--version' argument and outputs version info or package details accordingly. It uses standard Python libraries (sys) with no external network activity, no sensitive data handling, no code injection, and no suspicious logic. The functions are straightforward, with no anomalies or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard CLI utility for displaying package information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this script.",
