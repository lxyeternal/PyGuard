  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package that provides information about the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for input arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing output",
  "flows": "User input (via command-line arguments) -> main() function logic -> output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and only prints static information.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes main() which handles a command-line argument '--version' to display version info. No dynamic or external data is processed; no network activity, no code injection, no credential handling, and no suspicious behavior. The code is simple, serving as a CLI interface to display static package details. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI entrypoint that outputs static package information. It shows no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and content are standard and safe.",
