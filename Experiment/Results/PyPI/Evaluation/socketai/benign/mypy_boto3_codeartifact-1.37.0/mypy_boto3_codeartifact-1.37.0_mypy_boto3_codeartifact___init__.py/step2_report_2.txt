  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is primarily composed of import statements, constant definitions, and documentation.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network calls, or data processing.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.\n- The only anomaly noted is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- The code appears to be a standard SDK interface module for AWS CodeArtifact.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code is an interface module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the future year is noted but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the code is benign, with no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Confidence:* 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the lack of data flow and malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Confidence:* 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Reiterates the benign nature; mentions the future copyright year.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Confidence:* 1 (appropriate)\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion; no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Confidence:* 1 (correct)\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to the future year, but still no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Malware:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0 (correct)  \n  - *Confidence:* 0.9 (acceptable)\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high; no suspicious activity detected.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, perhaps a tiny risk due to the placeholder year, but negligible)  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The only adjustment I suggest is lowering the risk score slightly from 0 to 0.1 to reflect the minor anomaly (future year), but this does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Confidence |\n|---------|--------------|-------|------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   | 1          |\n\nThis reflects a very low security concern, consistent with the analysis.",
