{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface for interacting with the AWS CodeArtifact service, including importing relevant classes and defining the main client alias.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator) and the module's own code block with usage example.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly defines imports and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The usage example contains a copyright date in 2025, which is inconsistent with current timelines but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, constant assignments, and documentation. It imports classes from local modules, defines a client alias, and specifies __all__ for exports. The inline documentation includes an example of using boto3 with various paginators. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The copyright year is in the future (2025), which could be an anomaly, but it is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to be standard boilerplate for an SDK interface, with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module providing an interface to AWS CodeArtifact. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a normal SDK interface setup with documentation. No vulnerabilities or malware are detected.",
