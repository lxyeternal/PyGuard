  "purpose": "Provide an interface and imports for interacting with the AWS CodeArtifact service using boto3.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator) and the inline documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code only imports modules and defines variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up class and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The comment claims copyright year 2025, which is in the future, possibly indicating outdated or placeholder information; no malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains documentation, import statements, and variable assignments for boto3 clients and paginators. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or potentially dangerous operations. The code is straightforward and standard for setting up a service interface. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign interface setup for AWS CodeArtifact using boto3. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The only minor concern is the future copyright year, which seems to be a placeholder or typo.",
