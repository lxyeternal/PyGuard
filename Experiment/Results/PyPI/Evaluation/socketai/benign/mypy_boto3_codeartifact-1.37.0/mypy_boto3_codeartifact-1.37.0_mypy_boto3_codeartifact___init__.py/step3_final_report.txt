  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module for AWS CodeArtifact, providing import statements, documentation, and exports for various paginator classes and the client.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, documentation comments, and constant definitions; no dynamic input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which appears to be a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface setup with static imports and documentation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but could be corrected for clarity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a very low security risk score. Confidence in these conclusions is high (1), given the static and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
