  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely static type definitions using TypedDicts, type aliases, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n   - No executable logic, dynamic data handling, or external input processing.\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The copyright year 2025 is future-dated, which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is static, safe, and primarily for type hinting.\n   - The only notable anomaly is the future-dated copyright year (2025), which could be a typo or placeholder.\n   - No other logical flaws or suspicious claims are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the static, non-executable nature.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Risk score: 0 or very close, as the code is purely declarative.\n   - The scores seem appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues with high risk scores; the code is static and benign.\n   - No reason to adjust scores upward.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - The code does not perform any runtime operations, network calls, or data processing.\n   - No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The only potential concern is the future-dated copyright year (2025). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not an attack vector.\n   - No other suspicious assumptions are made in the reports.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS SDK, with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, straightforward type definitions)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (completely static, no runtime or external data handling)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It is a standard, safe type definition module for SDK purposes, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
