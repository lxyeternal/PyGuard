{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations for AWS CodeArtifact service data structures using TypedDicts and type aliases, providing type hints for a Python SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type definitions, import statements, and conditional imports based on Python version. It does not read external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security breaches.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows or untrusted data paths; the code strictly defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is purely declarative with type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static type declarations using TypedDict, type aliases, and conditional imports for compatibility. It includes no executable logic, input handling, or network operations. The purpose is to provide type annotations for AWS SDK responses and requests, which is standard for SDK type hinting. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The presence of license and documentation comments is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions for a Python SDK related to AWS CodeArtifact. It contains no executable or dynamic code, no external data handling, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. It appears to be a benign, well-structured SDK type definition module.",
