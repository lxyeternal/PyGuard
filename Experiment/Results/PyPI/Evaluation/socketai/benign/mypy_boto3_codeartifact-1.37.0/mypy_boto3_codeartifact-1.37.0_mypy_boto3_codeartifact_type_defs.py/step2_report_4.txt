  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code in detail.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a static Python module defining type annotations for AWS CodeArtifact SDK data structures.\n- Uses TypedDict, type aliases, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- Contains no executable logic, data processing, or external system interactions.\n- Includes a future-dated copyright (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of future-dated copyright (2025):** Unusual, but likely a placeholder or typo. Not a security concern.\n- **No dynamic or executable code:** The code is purely declarative, defining data structures and types.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No evident logical flaws or mistakes in the type definitions.\n- The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.\n\n### Malware or malicious activity:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports.\n- The code does not perform any network calls, handle untrusted input, or execute dynamic code.\n- No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports assign malware = 0, which aligns with the static, declarative nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the absence of runtime or external interactions.\n- The anomalous future copyright year is noted but does not impact security.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type definitions.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future year, which is probably a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not process untrusted data.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0. The code is static type annotations with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- All reports give a very low or zero risk score, which is appropriate.\n\n**Overall security stance:**  \n- The code is benign, purely declarative, and safe.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured static type definition module for AWS SDK, with no security concerns. The future-dated copyright is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such static SDK type definition files are sourced from trusted repositories. But based on the provided code and reports, there is no indication of malicious or suspicious activity.",
