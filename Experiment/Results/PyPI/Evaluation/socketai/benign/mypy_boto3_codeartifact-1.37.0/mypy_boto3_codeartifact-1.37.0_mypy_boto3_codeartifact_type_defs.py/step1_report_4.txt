  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS CodeArtifact service responses and requests, intended for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, conditional imports based on sys.version_info, and type annotations throughout class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no untrusted data sources, external system calls, or data flows that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and data structure definitions, with no executable logic or data processing flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns. The code primarily consists of type annotations and data schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures for API request and response types using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility. It includes no functions, no dynamic execution, and no external system interactions. The presence of constant definitions and structured type annotations poses no security risk. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected in the static type definitions and imports. Overall, the code appears to be purely structural and documentation-focused, with no malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of static type definitions for AWS CodeArtifact, intended for type safety and code clarity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code injection. It appears to be a benign, well-structured schema for API data types.",
