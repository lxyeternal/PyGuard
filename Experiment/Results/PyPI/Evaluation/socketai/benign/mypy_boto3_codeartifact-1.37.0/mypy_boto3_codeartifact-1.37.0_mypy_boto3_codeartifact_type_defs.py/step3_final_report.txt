  "purpose": "Static type definitions for AWS CodeArtifact SDK data structures, serving as type hints and documentation.",
  "sources": "No runtime data sources; only static type annotations and constants defined within the module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely declarative type definitions with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder or typo; no security relevance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static TypedDicts, type aliases, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable code, network calls, or data handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The only anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS SDK, with no malicious or security concerns. The only minor issue is the future year, which is likely a placeholder. Overall, the supply chain security risk is negligible.",
