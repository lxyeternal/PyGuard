{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for the AWS CodeArtifact service SDK, specifically for use with boto3 stubs. It provides detailed TypedDicts for request and response objects, facilitating type-safe interactions with the service API.",
  "sources": "Type definitions for request parameters, response data structures, and auxiliary types, primarily read during module import for static type checking.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; this code does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or perform network or file operations at runtime.",
  "flows": "No active data flows involving untrusted input; this module solely declares static data structures for static analysis purposes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright statement from 2025 and an import pattern that dynamically adjusts based on Python version, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. No obfuscated or unusual language features are used; the code is a straightforward type declaration module.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining TypedDicts, type aliases, and importing necessary typing modules. It handles Python version compatibility gracefully and specifies all types explicitly. There are no runtime behaviors, external data reads, or executable code that could be malicious. The licensing and copyright statement do not impact security. Overall, this is a well-structured type annotation module for AWS SDK bindings.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static, declarative module for type annotations and data structure definitions. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk present. It is designed solely for static type checking purposes and does not execute or process untrusted data at runtime.",
