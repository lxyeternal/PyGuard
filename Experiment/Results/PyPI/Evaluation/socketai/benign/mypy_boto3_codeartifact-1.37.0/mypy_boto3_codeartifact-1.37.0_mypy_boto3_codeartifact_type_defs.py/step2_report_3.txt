  "review": "Let's analyze the provided supply chain security reports step-by-step:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as static type definitions for AWS CodeArtifact SDK, primarily using TypedDicts, constants, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- The code is purely declarative, with no executable logic, network calls, or data processing.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is future-dated and likely a typo or placeholder.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of static type definitions only**: No executable code, no data flows involving untrusted input.\n- **Future-dated copyright (2025)**: Unusual but not malicious—likely a typo or placeholder.\n- **Conditional imports**: Standard practice for compatibility, not suspicious.\n- **No external data handling or dynamic code execution**: Consistent across all reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** No actual issues or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only minor concern is the future year 2025 in the copyright, which appears to be a typo or placeholder. This does not impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and declarative.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 or very close to it. No active or potential vulnerabilities, no external data handling, no executable logic.\n\n### Potential Misjudgments:\n- The reports assign very high confidence (1.0 or 0.95) that the code is benign, which is appropriate given the static nature.\n- The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which should be corrected but doesn't constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk, no vulnerabilities, no malicious patterns.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign scores independently, I would agree with the reports’ assessments, perhaps with a slight note to correct the copyright year.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, static type declaration module for AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright, which is likely a typo.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No security concerns. Maintain current scores, and consider correcting the copyright year for accuracy.",
