  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS CodeArtifact service, providing structured data types for API request and response objects.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, conditional imports based on Python version, and TypedDict class definitions containing data schemas.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, no network connections, or dynamic code execution points; primarily static data schemas.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve structured data being defined and typed but do not include untrusted data processing or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard Python features and type annotations. No suspicious dynamic code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions using TypedDict and standard imports, conditioned on Python version compatibility. No input/output handling, no data transformations, nor execution of untrusted code. The module functions as a schema container for API data structures. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or code execution that could be malicious. The use of conditional imports and type annotations is standard and safe. The copyright notice and documentation link are benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely a static type schema definition for AWS SDK models, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious dependency for type checking in a Python AWS SDK context.",
