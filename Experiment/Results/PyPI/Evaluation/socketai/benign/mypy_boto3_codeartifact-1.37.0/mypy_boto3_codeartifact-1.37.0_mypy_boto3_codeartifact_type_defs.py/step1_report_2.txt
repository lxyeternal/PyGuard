  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the AWS CodeArtifact SDK for use with mypy static type checking.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for classes, function parameters, and constants; import statements for modules and types; static definitions of TypedDicts and constants.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily consists of type definitions and imports, with no dynamic data processing or external data inputs.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines types and constants without executable logic or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a copyright notice with the year 2025, which is future-dated and potentially suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The use of type annotations and type definitions appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of type definitions and constants for a Python SDK, primarily using TypedDict and Union types to define data structures. It conditionally imports types based on Python version and imports constants from other modules. The code includes a future-dated copyright statement, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no functions, no data processing, no external data inputs or outputs, and no executable logic. The code appears to be a legitimate, static type definition module meant for type checking and documentation purposes. No suspicious activity, malicious code, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS CodeArtifact SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or sabotage. The only anomaly is the future-dated copyright year, which is likely a typographical error or placeholder. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
