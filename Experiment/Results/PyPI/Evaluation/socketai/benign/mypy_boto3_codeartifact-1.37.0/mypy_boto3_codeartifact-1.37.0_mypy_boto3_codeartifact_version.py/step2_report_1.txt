  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a comment containing a future year (2025). There are no dynamic behaviors, external data sources, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this as a minimal, benign version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note that the only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is unusual but not malicious.  \n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.  \n   - The scores assigned (malware, security risk, obfuscated) are all zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n   - The security risk score is also 0, which is justified.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.  \n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Potential Maliciousness or Assumptions**:  \n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the assessments are cautious and accurate.  \n   - The only \"anomaly\" is the future year, which is not suspicious but could be a typo or a placeholder. It does not affect security.\n\n5. **Overall Justification**:  \n   - The code is a typical version declaration, with no malicious or suspicious activity.  \n   - The future copyright year, while unusual, is not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nBased on the comprehensive review, I concur with the existing scores: all should remain at zero for malware and security risk, with high confidence in the benign nature of this code.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no security concerns. The only notable aspect is the future copyright year, which is not malicious but might warrant correction for clarity.",
