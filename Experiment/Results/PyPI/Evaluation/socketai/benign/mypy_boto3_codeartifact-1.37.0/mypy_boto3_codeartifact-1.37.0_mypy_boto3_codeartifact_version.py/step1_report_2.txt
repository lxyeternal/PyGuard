  "flows": "N/A, straightforward assignment",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; copyright date in the future (2025) is unusual but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable, which is typical for package versioning. The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to current dates, but this does not indicate malicious intent. No input/output, external data, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with a minor anomaly in the copyright year. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
