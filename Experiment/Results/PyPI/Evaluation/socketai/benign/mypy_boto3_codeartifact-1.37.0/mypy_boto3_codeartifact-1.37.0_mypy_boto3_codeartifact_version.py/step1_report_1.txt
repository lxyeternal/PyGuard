  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package, serving as a source of truth for the package's version number.",
  "sources": "The string assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The comment states 'Copyright 2025', which is a future year and potentially suspicious, but this alone is not malicious. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to __version__ and contains a copyright comment. There are no dynamic or untrusted data sources, no code execution, no external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The presence of a future copyright year is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for package versioning and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
