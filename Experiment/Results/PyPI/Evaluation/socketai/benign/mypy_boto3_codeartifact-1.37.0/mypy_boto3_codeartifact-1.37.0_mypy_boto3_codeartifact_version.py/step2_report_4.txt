  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply assigns a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No dynamic code, input handling, or external data sources are involved.\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year \"2025\".\n   - This is an unusual but benign inconsistency, not an error or malicious flaw.\n   - No other logical errors or security flaws are identified.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious behavior that would warrant higher scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher risk scores.\n   - The code is purely declarative, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code contains no code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are cautious and based on the code's simplicity.\n   - The only \"suspicious\" aspect is the future copyright year, which is not malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The current scores accurately reflect the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI agree with the reports' assessments. The code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The anomaly in the copyright year is benign.",
