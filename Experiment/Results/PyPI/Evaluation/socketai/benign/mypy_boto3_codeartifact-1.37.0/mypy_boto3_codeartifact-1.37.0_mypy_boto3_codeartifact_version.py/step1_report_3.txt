  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ with a string value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is in the future, but this is not suspicious behavior, just an unusual timestamp.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a version string for the module and includes a copyright comment. There are no data inputs, network calls, environment variable uses, or any code execution. No suspicious or malicious activity detected. The only notable point is the future copyright year, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
