  "purpose": "Defines the version of the module/package as a string.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or outputs in the code.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a static string to __version__, no flow from external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright comment with a future year (2025), which is inconsistent with the copyright date (2025) and may indicate an inconsistency but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a single assignment of a version string to a variable. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. The version string is hardcoded, which is typical for package versioning. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malicious code, no data leaks, or suspicious behaviors.",
