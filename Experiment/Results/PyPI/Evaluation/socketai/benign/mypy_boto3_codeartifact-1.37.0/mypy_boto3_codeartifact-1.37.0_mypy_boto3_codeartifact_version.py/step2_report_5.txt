  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply assigns a string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no data flows, external inputs, or code execution.\n   - The code is static and straightforward, with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Anomalies and Unusual Aspects**:\n   - All reports note the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, this is not malicious.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent is present.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable because the code is trivial and unambiguous.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Potential Inconsistencies or Concerns**:\n   - The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, but it does not impact security.\n   - No reports suggest any suspicious or malicious activity, and the reasoning is consistent.\n\n**My assessment**:\n- The code is benign, standard for package versioning.\n- No evidence supports any malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The current scores are reasonable.\n- I would keep the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- The confidence scores could remain high, given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
