  "purpose": "Declare the package version with a simple string assignment.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; static assignment of __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external interactions, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a comment indicating a future year. No dynamic code, data handling, or external dependencies are present. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is benign. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only notable aspect is the future copyright year, which does not impact security or functionality. The existing scores are accurate and appropriate.",
