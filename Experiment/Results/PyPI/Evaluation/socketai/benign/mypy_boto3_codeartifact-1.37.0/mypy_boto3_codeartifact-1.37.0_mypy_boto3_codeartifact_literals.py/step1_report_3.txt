{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS CodeArtifact and related service constants used for type safety and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it solely declares constants and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; the code does not perform data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only establishes type literals.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes an unusually large set of string literal definitions but nothing suspicious or malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The copyright date is set to 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a typo or placeholder rather than malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS service string literals, with conditional import handling for Python versions before and after 3.12. It defines constants and type aliases for various AWS service names, resource types, and pagination identifiers. No input/output handling, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, nor any suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The structure and content are consistent with a safe type definition module, primarily used for type checking in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, straightforward set of type definitions for AWS SDK constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The presence of many literal constants is typical for such type annotations. The only potential anomaly is the future copyright year, which appears to be a typo or placeholder rather than malicious intent.",
