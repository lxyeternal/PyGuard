  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS CodeArtifact service and related resources for type safety and code assistance.",
  "sources": "Importing sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None observed; code only defines literals without data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The large list of AWS service names and resource identifiers appears standard for SDK definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type literal definitions for various AWS CodeArtifact and AWS service-related identifiers, with conditional import for compatibility. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external communications. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The content appears to be a standard type definition module for type hinting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign type definition file intended for type safety and autocompletion, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
