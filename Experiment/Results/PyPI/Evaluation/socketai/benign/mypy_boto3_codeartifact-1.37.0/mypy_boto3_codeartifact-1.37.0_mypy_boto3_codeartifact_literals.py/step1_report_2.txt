  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS CodeArtifact service-related string constants and other AWS services for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module for version check; defining string literal types for various AWS resource, paginator, region, and service names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; code is purely defining constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic execution or data manipulation present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward type annotation definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types representing AWS service names, resource types, and paginator names. These are static definitions intended for type hinting, with no runtime behavior or data processing. There are no dynamic inputs, no network activity, or code that could be malicious. The file is solely a set of type aliases for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for AWS service literals, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured static type annotation module.",
