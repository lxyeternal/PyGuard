  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS CodeArtifact and related constants; sources are static literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; purely static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; the only note is the future copyright year (2025), which seems to be a typo or placeholder.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward type aliases using Literal, with conditional import for Python 3.12+. No dynamic code, no external data, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign static type definitions, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the definitions.\n- No dynamic behavior, no external inputs, no suspicious patterns.\n- Notes the large set of literals but finds nothing suspicious.\n- Confirms the code is a standard, benign set of type aliases.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Highlights the absence of untrusted data handling, static literals, and no dynamic code.\n- Notes the large set of constants but considers it normal for SDK definitions.\n- Mentions the future copyright year (2025) as possibly a typo.\n- Finds no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar findings: static literals, no data flow, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- Recognizes the conditional import pattern for Python compatibility.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous assessments: static, safe, no dynamic behavior.\n- No external data or malicious patterns.\n- Well-structured, straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports agree that the code consists solely of static type alias definitions using `Literal`. There are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output handling, no code execution, and no external data processing.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected. The code is purely declarative, intended for type hinting and static analysis.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security Risks:** None.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, static, and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk, as the code is purely static type definitions.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured set of type aliases for AWS SDK constants, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
