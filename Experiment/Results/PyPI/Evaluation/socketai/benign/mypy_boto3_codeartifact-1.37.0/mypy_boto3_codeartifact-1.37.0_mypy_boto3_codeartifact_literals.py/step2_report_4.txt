  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines string literal types for AWS CodeArtifact and related constants. No dynamic behavior, no external inputs, no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type definitions. The confidence is high (1), and no anomalies or risks are detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving as static type annotations. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code only defines constants for AWS services, with no data flow or untrusted input.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is static, straightforward, and safe.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights the large set of literals, notes the future copyright year (2025) as possibly a typo, but emphasizes that the code is safe.\n- **Assessment:** The mention of the future year is an anomaly but likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** The code remains a benign static set of type definitions.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code only defines literals for AWS service constants, with no data processing or external communication.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code sources are static literals, with proper conditional import for Python version compatibility. No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a straightforward static type alias module.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is static, defining string literal types for AWS services and related constants.\n- **Behavior:** No dynamic code, no input/output, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware or Obfuscation:** None detected or suggested by the code. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Security Risks:** None. The code is purely for type hinting and static analysis support.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** Given the unanimity and the nature of the code, I would assign:\n  - **Malware score:** 0 (benign static type definitions)\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n  - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n- **Additional notes:** The code is well-structured, with conditional imports for compatibility, and only defines constants. No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, static, and intended solely for type annotations. No security concerns or malware risks are present.",
