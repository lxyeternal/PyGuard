  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS CodeArtifact and related service constants to be used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string literals used to define type aliases for various constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or output; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of static literal type definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines multiple type aliases using Literal for various constants relevant to AWS services. It uses conditional import to ensure compatibility with Python 3.12+. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be straightforward and safe, solely establishing type aliases for use elsewhere in a codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of type definitions intended to improve type safety and readability for AWS SDK interactions. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
