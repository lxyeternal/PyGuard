  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure the correctness of the assessment and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a benign, static set of type definitions for AWS service constants.\n- No untrusted data, dynamic code, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, and no security risks are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step review:\n\n#### 1. **Code correctness and issues:**\n- The code only defines string literal types for AWS constants.\n- No issues are present in the code logic or structure.\n- The conditional import for `Literal` is correct and standard for compatibility.\n- The literal values are static and well-structured.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues or bugs detected.\n\n#### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type definitions.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The mention of the future copyright year (2025) is an observation, not a flaw.\n\n**Verdict:** No errors or mistakes.\n\n#### 3. **Scores justification:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0, justified because no malicious code or behavior exists.\n- Risk score: 0 or very close to 0, as the code is purely static and safe.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- The scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n#### 4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly state that there are no assumptions about untrusted input or external data.\n- No dynamic or runtime behavior that could be exploited.\n\n**Verdict:** No false assumptions or overlooked vulnerabilities.\n\n#### 5. **Consistency of scores with the reports:**\n- All reports give malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, which aligns with the static, benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the nature of the code:**\n- Static type alias definitions for AWS constants.\n- No dynamic or external data processing.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (definitively benign)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The only minor anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder. It does not impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and justified. The code is a benign, static set of type definitions with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. If desired, update the copyright year to a current or past year for correctness.",
