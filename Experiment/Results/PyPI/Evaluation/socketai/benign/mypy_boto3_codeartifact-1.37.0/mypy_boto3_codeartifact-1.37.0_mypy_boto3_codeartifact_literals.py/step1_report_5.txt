{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for AWS CodeArtifact and related service constants to be used for type annotations in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "The code sources include static string literals assigned to various type aliases, imported modules (sys, typing), and __all__ for module exports.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code solely defines constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely declarative with static literals. Importing 'sys' and conditionally importing 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations using Literal types for various AWS-related constants. It includes conditional import for compatibility with Python versions >= 3.12. All literals are static, and no input processing, external data reading, or dynamic code execution is present. The __all__ variable correctly exports all defined types. The code is well-structured, straightforward, and contains no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of type alias definitions for AWS SDK literals, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It serves as a static type hinting utility for boto3 stubs.",
