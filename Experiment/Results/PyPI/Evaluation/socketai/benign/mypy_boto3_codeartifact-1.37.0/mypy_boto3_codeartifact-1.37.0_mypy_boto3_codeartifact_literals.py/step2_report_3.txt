  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines static string literal types for AWS CodeArtifact and related constants. No dynamic behavior, no untrusted data, no malicious code.  \n- **Findings:** Completely benign static type definitions. The mention of the future copyright year (2025) is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; the code is safe and purely for type annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes static literal type definitions for AWS services and constants. No dynamic code or data processing.  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, static type aliases for AWS service constants, with no dynamic behavior. The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025).  \n- **Findings:** No malicious intent or behavior; the large set of literals is typical for such definitions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — reasonable.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** No actual risk or malicious activity present; the future date is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report correctly assesses the code as safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above — static literals for AWS constants, no data flow or external input.  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Static type definitions for AWS constants, with proper conditional import handling. No dynamic or untrusted data.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior. The code is purely declarative.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code contains no executable or malicious content—only static type alias definitions.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** The code is purely static type alias definitions, with no runtime behavior, external data, or code execution.  \n- **Obfuscated:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques used.  \n- **Risk:** The code's purpose is to provide type safety for AWS SDK constants, which is a standard, safe practice. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe, with no security concerns.",
