{
  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for AWS CodeArtifact and related constants to facilitate type checking and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Static literals assigned directly to variables; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Minor anomaly: the copyright year is set to 2025, which appears to be a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal, with conditional import for Python version compatibility. No dynamic code, no external data, no code execution, and no obfuscation detected. The structure is straightforward and standard for SDK constant definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type hinting. It poses no security risk or malicious threat. The only minor issue is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but could be corrected.",
