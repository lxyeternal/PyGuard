  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the provided code against their conclusions, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code defines string literal types for AWS CodeArtifact constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling; purely static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies detected; notes the copyright year 2025 as possibly a typo.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, safe, and solely for type annotations. No malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** High confidence (1), malware score (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines type literals for AWS services and constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; notes the large set of literals is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, safe, and standard for type hinting.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** High confidence (1), malware score (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior, just static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining string literal types for AWS constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling involved.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions the future copyright year (2025) as a potential typo.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is safe, straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** Slightly less (0.95), but still very high; malware score (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The only minor note is the future year, likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately states the code defines type literals for AWS service constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard SDK-like definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** High confidence (1), malware score (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining type aliases for AWS constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard static literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured, safe, no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence & Malware:** Full confidence (1), malware score (0).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is static, defining string literal types for AWS SDK constants.\n- **Behavior & Risks:** No dynamic code, no data processing, no external inputs, no obfuscated or malicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor point is the copyright year 2025, which is likely a placeholder or typo.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static set of type definitions for AWS SDK constants, with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code serves as a helpful static typing utility, with no security concerns.",
