  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential dynamic execution (exec/eval), hardcoded secrets, input and environment variable reads, network communication, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamic code, network connections, data exfiltration points, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables) potentially leading to dynamic execution or data leaks; data processing functions may handle untrusted data; network communication points may transmit data externally.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, complex string manipulations, unusual import patterns, potential network activity without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent but do not confirm malicious payloads. No explicit malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system damage are observed. The presence of obfuscation and potential secrets warrants cautious scoring. Absence of code or trivial code results in low suspicion. The scores across reports are generally consistent with their descriptions, but given the suspicion level, the malware score should be slightly increased in some cases to reflect potential hidden malicious behavior. Overall, the code does not demonstrate confirmed malicious activity but warrants attention due to obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious payloads. The current scores are appropriate, though slight adjustments to malware suspicion could be considered. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants cautious review if further code details emerge.",
