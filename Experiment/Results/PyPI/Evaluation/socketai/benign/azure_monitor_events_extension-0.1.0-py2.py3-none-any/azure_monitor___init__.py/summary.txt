  "security_risk": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion but no confirmed malicious payloads. The current scores are appropriate, though slight adjustments to malware suspicion could be considered. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants cautious review if further code details emerge."
