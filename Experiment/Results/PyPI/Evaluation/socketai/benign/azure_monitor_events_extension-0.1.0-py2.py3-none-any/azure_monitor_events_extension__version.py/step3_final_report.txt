{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal metadata file containing licensing information and a version string declaration, typical for open-source projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains comments and a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward license comment block and a version variable assignment. It contains no executable logic, input sources, or data flows. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as metadata with licensing comments and a version string. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
