{
  "purpose": "The code sets up an Azure Monitor event tracking system using OpenTelemetry and logging, allowing events with custom attributes to be logged.",
  "sources": "Reading input from function parameters (name, custom_dimensions), accessing module-level variables, and internal method calls",
  "sinks": "Logging output via the _event_logger, which sends log entries to configured handlers",
  "flows": "track_event() calls _initialize(), which adds a logging handler and sets log level; then logs event name with optional custom dimensions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network calls, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard use of logging and OpenTelemetry components",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logging handler for Azure Monitor integration, initializes it once, and provides a function to log events with optional custom dimensions. It uses standard Python logging and OpenTelemetry SDK components without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a legitimate monitoring setup with no anomalies indicating malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a straightforward event logging mechanism for Azure Monitor using standard libraries. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign monitoring utility.",
