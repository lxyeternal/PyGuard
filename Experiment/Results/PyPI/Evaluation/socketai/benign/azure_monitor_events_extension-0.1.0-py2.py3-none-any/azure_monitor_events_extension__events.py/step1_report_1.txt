{
  "purpose": "The code sets up logging handlers for Azure Monitor with OpenTelemetry integration, allowing tracking of custom events with optional dimensions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'name' parameter in track_event() and optional 'custom_dimensions' dictionary, as well as logging configuration from getLogger and addHandler.",
  "sinks": "Logs generated by _event_logger.info(), which could potentially be sent over the network to monitoring endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'name' and 'custom_dimensions' flow into _event_logger.info() via track_event(), which then triggers logging with extra attributes set for telemetry.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behavior, and no obfuscated code. The code only configures logging and telemetry handlers. No data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom logging behavior for Azure Monitor telemetry. It adds a handler to the logger to capture events and attach attributes, then provides a function to log events with optional custom dimensions. No external data sources, insecure practices, or malicious patterns are evident. The structure and logic are straightforward and aligned with standard telemetry setup. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent, and no suspicious anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation for telemetry and event tracking using Azure Monitor and OpenTelemetry. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The setup is typical for telemetry integration, with no evident supply chain threats.",
