  "purpose": "Set up telemetry event tracking using Azure Monitor and OpenTelemetry with a custom logging handler.",
  "sources": "LogRecord input in _get_attributes; parameters in track_event() (name, custom_dimensions).",
  "sinks": "logger.info() call with 'name' and 'extra=custom_dimensions'.",
  "flows": "track_event() calls _initialize(), then logs 'name' with optional custom_dimensions via logger.info(), which passes through the custom handler adding attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. Potential data leakage if untrusted data is logged, but this is standard logging behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of telemetry event logging. It defines a custom handler that adds a specific attribute, initializes it once, and provides a function to log events with optional custom dimensions. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logging setup relies on standard libraries and practices. The only concern is potential data leakage if untrusted input is logged, which is a common logging issue, not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2, confidence=0.9) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard telemetry event tracking implementation with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The potential data leakage concern is typical for logging systems and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores and confidence levels across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
