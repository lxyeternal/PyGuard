  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform a specific computational task or utility function, but the exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly evident in the provided code snippet; there are no apparent external input functions or data reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not clearly defined; there are no obvious points where untrusted data could be used maliciously, such as system commands, network connections, or file writes.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is identified; the code does not demonstrate significant source-to-sink pathways that indicate malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual constructs. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python syntax. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system damage, are present. It does not include any suspicious imports or code patterns. The absence of external inputs and outputs suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or malware indications. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
