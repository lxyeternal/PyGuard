  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility script, possibly for handling user input or performing basic operations.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the standard input (e.g., using input() function) or external files, if present. No explicit sources are provided in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data might be sent to the console (print statements) or written to files. No network connections, database queries, or system commands are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through variables within the script, possibly ending up in output functions like print(). No complex or external data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are observed. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be simple and benign, without any suspicious constructs. It does not perform any network activity, file system tampering, or use of unsafe functions. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code's clarity and lack of external dependencies further suggest a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code seems safe, with no hidden backdoors or malicious intent.",
