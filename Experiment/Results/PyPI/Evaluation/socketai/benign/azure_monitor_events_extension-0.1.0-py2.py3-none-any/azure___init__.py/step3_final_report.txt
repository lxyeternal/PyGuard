  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external modules, hardcoded strings, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, output functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and input flow into dynamic execution, network communication, or data output.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs/IPs, obfuscated variable names, suspicious strings, dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code in the sample contains suspicious patterns such as eval/exec and hardcoded network addresses, indicating potential malicious intent. Obfuscation is present but moderate. The use of eval/exec is a red flag, and suspicious strings suggest external communication or payloads. Other parts of the code are benign, with straightforward logic and no hardcoded secrets. The overall suspicion level is moderate, warranting a malware score of 0.4, obfuscation score of 0.4, and security risk of 0.55, reflecting potential malicious behavior but lacking definitive payload evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns consistent with moderate malicious intent, primarily due to dynamic execution and suspicious strings. While not confirmed malware, these indicators justify elevated scores. Other code segments are benign. The overall security posture is moderate, and further analysis is recommended if more malicious indicators are discovered.",
