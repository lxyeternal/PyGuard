{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but the actual intent cannot be fully determined without detailed comments or context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, possibly environment variables, and imports modules, but no external untrusted input sources such as network sockets or files are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to variables, returns values, and potentially logs information. No direct data leaks or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions to output or return statements; no clear source-to-sink malicious flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. The code uses standard library functions; no obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or unusual constructs are present. No suspicious network activity or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines functions with clear, straightforward logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The lack of dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls suggests a benign intent. The overall structure is typical for utility scripts or modules. Without external inputs or network interactions, the risk appears minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, benign code with no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or supply chain sabotage.",
