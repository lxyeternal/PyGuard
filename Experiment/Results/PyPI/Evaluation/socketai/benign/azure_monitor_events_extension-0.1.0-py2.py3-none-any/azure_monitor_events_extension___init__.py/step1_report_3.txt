  "purpose": "Expose the track_event function for external use, likely to log or send telemetry data.",
  "sources": "Import from azure.monitor.events.extension._events, and local _version module for version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or network operations within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow paths are explicitly present in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; code appears straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a third-party Azure module and exposes it via __all__, setting a version string. There are no user inputs, no data processing, and no network or file operations within this fragment. The structure aligns with a standard package __init__.py file. No indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior are evident. The code is very simple and standard in form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer exposing a telemetry function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical for SDK or library modules and appears safe.",
