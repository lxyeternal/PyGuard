{
  "purpose": "The code appears to expose a single function, track_event, for external use, likely related to logging or telemetry within an Azure monitoring context.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'track_event' from an internal Azure monitoring extension module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to leaks; no external network or sensitive data handling is visible.",
  "flows": "The source (import of track_event) flows into the module's namespace for external use. No data processing or untrusted data flows are present in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, importing a function and defining module metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, involving an import from an internal Azure monitor extension, defining __all__ for exports, and setting __version__ from a local version module. No input/output, data processing, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is clean and appears to serve as a module wrapper or interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module interface for exposing a telemetry tracking function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
