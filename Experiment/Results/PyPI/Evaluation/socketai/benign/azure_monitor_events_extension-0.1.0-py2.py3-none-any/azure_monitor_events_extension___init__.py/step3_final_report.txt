  "purpose": "A minimal module that imports and re-exports the 'track_event' function from an Azure monitoring extension, serving as an API interface.",
  "sources": "Import of 'track_event' from external Azure SDK module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import of 'track_event' (source) with no further data processing or transmission (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard '__init__.py' module that exposes 'track_event' from an Azure SDK. It contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling indicate benign intent. The imported function's internal behavior is not shown, but nothing in this snippet suggests malicious activity. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's nature. Confidence is high (1), as the code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exposing a telemetry function with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
