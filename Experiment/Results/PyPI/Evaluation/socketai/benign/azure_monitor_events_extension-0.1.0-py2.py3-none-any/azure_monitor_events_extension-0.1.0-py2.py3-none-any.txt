      "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns consistent with moderate malicious intent, primarily due to dynamic execution and suspicious strings. While not confirmed malware, these indicators justify elevated scores. Other code segments are benign. The overall security posture is moderate, and further analysis is recommended if more malicious indicators are discovered."

The current scores are appropriate, though slight adjustments to malware suspicion could be considered. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants cautious review if further code details emerge."
