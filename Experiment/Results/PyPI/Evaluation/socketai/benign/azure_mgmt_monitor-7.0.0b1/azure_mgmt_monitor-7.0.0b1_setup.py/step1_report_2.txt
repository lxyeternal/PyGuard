  "purpose": "This script is used for setting up the Python package 'azure-mgmt-monitor' for distribution, including extracting version info and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "File system reads: version.py or _version.py, README.md, CHANGELOG.md",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processed or used insecurely",
  "flows": "Reads version info from version files, reads documentation files, then passes data to setup() for package configuration",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated logic, no external network access, no malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads local files for version and documentation information, then invokes setuptools.setup() with static and derived data. It performs standard package setup procedures with no dynamic or external data manipulation that could indicate malicious activity. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It securely reads version data and prepares package metadata for distribution.",
