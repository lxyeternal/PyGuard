  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The version extraction uses regex on local files, which is a common pattern.\n- No external network activity, code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The dependencies and package metadata are static or derived from trusted local files.\n- The reports assign very low malware and security risk scores, which seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code reads version info from local files, reads README and CHANGELOG, and passes data to `setup()`. No issues found.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no network, no obfuscation, no code injection.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal; only standard file reads and package setup.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Regex usage for version extraction:** While standard, it could potentially fail if the version line is formatted differently. However, this is a known pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **File existence check:** The code checks for the existence of `version.py` or `_version.py`, which is good practice.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is justified given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (around 0.1), which is reasonable given the nature of the script.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No reason to assign higher malware or security risk scores based on the provided code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (standard package setup with minimal risk)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| 0.0       | 0.0          | 0.1   |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and standard.",
