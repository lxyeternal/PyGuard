  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure resource management test suite with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The only security concern is the hardcoded password, which is typical in test scripts and should be replaced with secure secret management in production. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis and appropriate for the context."
