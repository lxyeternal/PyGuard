  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard autogenerated test code for Azure SDK, importing legitimate libraries.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No untrusted data, no suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, boilerplate test code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable, given it's test code with minimal risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard test code.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, standard SDK testing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, calls Azure SDK functions.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No malicious data handling, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly a benign test suite.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK test, no malicious intent.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, typical test code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar test code, with some mention of potential data leak.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** Reads data from Azure, but only for testing, no evidence of malicious data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; only standard test operations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, given the minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, generated test code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is reasonable given that the code interacts with cloud services and could potentially expose sensitive info if misused. However, the code itself does not do so.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard, autogenerated test code for Azure SDK operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- The minimal security risk score reflects the fact that, in a real environment, such test code could, if misconfigured, leak sensitive info, but as presented, it is safe.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent or payload.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minor, inherent to cloud interaction, but no actual security issue.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are appropriate. The code is safe, standard test code with negligible security risks and no malware.",
