{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package by including all .py modules found in the 'src' directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to list Python files in the 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "The setup function potentially writes package metadata; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The list of module stems obtained from the filesystem is passed to the setup function as 'py_modules'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward usage of pathlib and setuptools. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib to interact with the filesystem. It then uses setuptools.setup() to define package modules by globbing all .py files in the 'src' directory and extracting their stem names. This is a typical pattern for packaging Python modules, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code flow. No untrusted input sources or dangerous sinks are involved. The logic is simple and adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script that dynamically includes all Python modules in the 'src' directory. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
