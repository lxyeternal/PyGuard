  "purpose": "To include all Python modules (*.py files) from the 'src' directory into the package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Filesystem globbing of '*.py' files in the 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function call with 'py_modules' argument.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data (list of module filenames) into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib and setup from setuptools, then dynamically lists all '.py' files in 'src', extracting their stem names to include as modules. It performs filesystem operations without untrusted input, external data, or code execution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The logic aligns with common packaging practices, and no malicious or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for Python packaging, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as such, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
