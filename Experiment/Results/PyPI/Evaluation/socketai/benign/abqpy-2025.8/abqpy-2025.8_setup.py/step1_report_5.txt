{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package by including all .py modules in the 'src' directory as standalone modules.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to list Python files in the 'src' directory using Path.glob.",
  "sinks": "Uses the list of module stems directly in the setup() function; no sinks for untrusted data are apparent.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data (list of .py files) flows into the setup configuration to define modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward setup task without hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Path' from pathlib to access the filesystem, then uses setuptools' setup() to define modules by listing all Python files in the 'src' directory. It constructs a list of module names by stripping the '.py' extension from each filename found. This is a standard packaging pattern and contains no malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging Python modules. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
