  "purpose": "This code is used to set up a Python package by listing all Python modules in the 'src' directory for packaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to locate Python files (*.py) in the 'src' directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where untrusted input could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Filesystem globbing of 'src/*.py' to extract module names for the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard library functions for module listing and setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path from pathlib and setup from setuptools, then dynamically creates a list of module names by globbing the 'src' directory for Python files. This is a common pattern for packaging Python modules. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code does not execute untrusted data, nor does it perform network operations or data leaks. It is a straightforward setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging without any malicious intent or security risks.",
