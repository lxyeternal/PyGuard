{
  "purpose": "This code is used for setting up a Python package by specifying modules to include, based on Python files in the 'src' directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads the directory 'src' to identify Python files using Path.glob(\"*.py\")",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the file system (source) to passing module names into setup() (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path for filesystem operations and setuptools for packaging. It dynamically generates a list of Python module names from the 'src' directory to be included in the package setup. The code appears straightforward and standard for Python packaging workflows. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. No malicious patterns or suspicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
