  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is simply: `from __future__ import annotations`\n   - All reports correctly identify this as a standard, benign Python future import statement used for enabling postponed evaluation of annotations.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**:\n   - None of the reports find any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain any suspicious logic.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities beyond the code snippet.\n   - Since the code is just an import statement, there are no grounds for higher risk scores.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is harmless.\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the assessment that the code is a benign, standard Python feature import with no security concerns.",
