  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n   - The code is a single `from __future__ import annotations` statement.\n   - All reports agree that this is a benign, standard practice for enabling postponed evaluation of annotations in Python.\n\n2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the benign nature of the code.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. Scores review:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign intent of the code.\n\n4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or security concern.\n   - The code is a straightforward import statement with no data flow, no external interactions, and no suspicious behavior.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. Malware score considerations:\n   - Since the code only imports a feature from the `__future__` module, there's no indication of malicious intent.\n   - The malware score should remain at 0.\n\n6. Challenging assumptions:\n   - The reports assume the code is benign based on its minimal nature.\n   - This is justified; no hidden or malicious behavior is suggested or detectable.\n\n7. Score consistency:\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless import statement.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain all scores at 0 for malware and security risk.\n- The confidence remains at 1, as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern.\n- Scores are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n**Final malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0",
