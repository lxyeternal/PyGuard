  "purpose": "Enable postponed evaluation of annotations in Python using __future__ import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only imports a feature.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python future import statement. It does not contain any data sources, sinks, or flows. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising behavior is present. The code's simplicity and purpose are well-understood, and the absence of any suspicious activity or code patterns confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python feature import with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward import statement, and no further action is necessary.",
