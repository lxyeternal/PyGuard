  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues**:  \nAll reports describe the code as a single `from __future__ import annotations` statement. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or any other issues. The code snippet is benign and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no data flow, sinks, or sources, and no malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is straightforward.  \n- **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nNo report suggests any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is purely a standard import statement with no potential for harm.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \nSince there's no malicious activity, the malware score should remain 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports are cautious and avoid assumptions beyond the code's evident purpose. They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nScores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct, no security risk)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code snippet is a standard Python future import statement used for compatibility and feature enablement. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and does not require any mitigation or further scrutiny.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the code's nature.",
