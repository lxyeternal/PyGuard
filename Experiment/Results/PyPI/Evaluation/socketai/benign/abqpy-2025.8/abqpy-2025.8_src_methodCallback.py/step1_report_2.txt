{
  "purpose": "The code only contains an import statement for the __future__ annotations feature, which enables postponed evaluation of annotations in Python 3.7+.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which reads no external data or input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, as the code does not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement for __future__.annotations, which is a standard feature in Python to delay evaluation of annotations. It is not malicious and is often used for forward compatibility and type hints. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and common Python feature import with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
