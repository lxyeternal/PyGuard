  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a single import statement: `from __future__ import annotations`. There are no other code elements, data sources, sinks, or flows. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the code as benign and standard.  \n- They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.  \n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `confidence: 1`.  \n- These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.  \n- The uniformity across reports is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- Since the code is a straightforward import of a future feature with no malicious or risky behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.  \n- The scores correctly reflect zero security risk and malware potential.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n- No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a compatibility feature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code snippet is a minimal, standard import statement used for compatibility in Python 3.7+.\n- There is no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their scoring.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions.**",
