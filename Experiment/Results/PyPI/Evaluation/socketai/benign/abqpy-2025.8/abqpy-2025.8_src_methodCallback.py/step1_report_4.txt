  "purpose": "Import future annotations feature for improved type hinting compatibility in Python 3.7+",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or transformations occur in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; solely an import statement with no additional logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a single import statement that enables the use of postponed evaluation of annotations. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. No anomalies or malicious constructs are evident. The import is a common, legitimate feature used for type hinting improvements in Python versions 3.7 and above.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of a standard future import statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
