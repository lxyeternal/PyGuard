{
  "purpose": "The code imports future annotations to enable postponed evaluation of annotations, improving compatibility and type hinting in Python 3.7+.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially vulnerable points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present due to lack of executable code beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only an import statement with no additional code or logic is unusual; it may suggest incomplete or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement for __future__.annotations, which is a standard feature in Python 3.7 and later to enable postponed evaluation of type annotations. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious operations. The minimal nature of this code indicates it is likely part of a larger codebase or a placeholder. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is observable from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a compatibility feature for type hints. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
