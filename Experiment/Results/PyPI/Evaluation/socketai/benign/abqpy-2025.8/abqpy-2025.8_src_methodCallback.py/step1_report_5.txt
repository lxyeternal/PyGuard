{
  "purpose": "This code imports future annotations for improved type hinting syntax support in Python 3.7+.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only performs an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this isolated line.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, using only a future import; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement for future annotations, which is a standard practice to enable postponed evaluation of annotations in Python versions before 3.10. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The minimal scope and simplicity suggest no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward, and typical for Python codebases that need compatibility with future features. No security concerns or malware indications are present.",
