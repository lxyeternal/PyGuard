  "review": "Let's review the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code contains only a single import statement for `__future__.annotations`.\n- No input sources, data processing, or malicious code are present.\n- The code is standard, minimal, and intended for compatibility.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the logic, reasoning, and summary in each report\n- All reports correctly identify the import as a standard feature used for postponed evaluation of annotations.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and serves a compatibility purpose.\n\n**Observation:** The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review the scores assigned\n- **Confidence:** All reports have confidence 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All are 0, correctly indicating no malware.\n- **Security risk:** All are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- Since the code is purely a standard import with no malicious intent, no reason exists to assign a higher risk score.\n- The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** No adjustments needed; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Challenge any assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n- No assumptions about potential exploits are made, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard Python feature import with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as harmless and standard. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall verdict:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet poses no security concern.",
