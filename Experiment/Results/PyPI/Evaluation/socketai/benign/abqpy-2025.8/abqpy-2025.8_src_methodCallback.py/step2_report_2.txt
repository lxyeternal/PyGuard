  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of an import statement for `__future__.annotations`. There are no other code elements, data sources, sinks, or flows present. This is consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.  \n   - The import statement is a standard Python feature used for compatibility, not malicious activity.  \n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is involved.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The mention of \"anomalies\" as the minimal code with no suspicious patterns is appropriate.  \n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - The security risk score is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential for Reassessment of Scores:**  \n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the scores are reasonable.  \n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   - If this snippet is part of a larger codebase, its security implications depend on the rest of the code. But based solely on this snippet, no issues are present.  \n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly notes the lack of such issues.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a simple, standard Python import statement for `__future__.annotations`, serving as a compatibility feature with no malicious or suspicious intent. The scoring and reasoning are appropriate.",
