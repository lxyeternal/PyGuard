{
  "purpose": "The code imports the __future__.annotations feature for postponed evaluation of annotations, primarily for compatibility and forward-compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables; it solely contains an import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present, as the code is a single import statement with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement for a Python feature used for compatibility. It contains no malicious code, data sources, or sinks. The import is standard and benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident or implied. The code's simplicity and standard usage justify the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python import statement with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
