  "purpose": "Defines custom Sphinx roles to insert package version information into documentation, retrieving version data via importlib.metadata.version() based on user input.",
  "sources": "User input string for package name and optional prefix/suffix; call to importlib.metadata.version(package).",
  "sinks": "The call to importlib.metadata.version(package), which fetches installed package version info.",
  "flows": "User input -> parsing in run() -> metadata.version(package) -> text assembly for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly defines Sphinx roles that retrieve package version info from the local environment using standard library functions. It processes user input safely, with no external data sources or untrusted code execution. The only potential concern is that version info could be sensitive in some contexts, but as it only reads installed package data, this is minimal. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports align with this assessment, with a minor overestimation of security risk in one report (0.1), which is acceptable given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for Sphinx extensions that safely retrieves and displays package version information. There is no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The minor security risk score is justified but can be considered effectively zero. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
