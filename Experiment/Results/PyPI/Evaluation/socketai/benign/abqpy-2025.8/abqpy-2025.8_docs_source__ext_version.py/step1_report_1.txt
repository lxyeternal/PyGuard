{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Sphinx roles for inserting version information of Python packages into documentation, dynamically retrieving package versions using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name from self.text in the run() method, and uses importlib.metadata.version(package) to retrieve version data.",
  "sinks": "The only significant sink is the call to importlib.metadata.version(package), which retrieves package version info based on user-provided text.",
  "flows": "User inputs (package names) are processed in run(), passed to importlib.metadata.version(), then formatted into text for documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The version string is dynamically fetched based on user input, but this is standard for such roles.",
  "analysis": "The script defines roles for Sphinx documentation, allowing insertion of package version info dynamically. It splits user input to parse optional prefixes, suffixes, and package names. The core function fetches version info via importlib.metadata, which is a standard Python library method. The roles for major, minor, and patch versions are simple extensions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident, as the code performs straightforward data retrieval and string formatting without side effects or external network connections. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Sphinx extension for displaying package versions and does not contain malicious behavior. It securely retrieves version information based on user input, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
