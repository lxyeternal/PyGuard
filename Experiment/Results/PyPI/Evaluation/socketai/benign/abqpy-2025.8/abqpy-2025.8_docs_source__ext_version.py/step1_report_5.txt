{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Sphinx roles for inserting package version information into documentation, dynamically retrieving version info from installed Python packages.",
  "sources": "metadata.version(package) retrieves the version of a package from the environment using importlib.metadata",
  "sinks": "The version string obtained from metadata.version is used in constructing the documentation text; no external or untrusted data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version(package) → Usage in run() to construct version string for documentation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; straightforward use of standard library functions. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party Sphinx components, defines roles for version display, retrieves package versions dynamically, and constructs formatted text. It relies on importlib.metadata to get package versions, which is a secure, standard approach. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is well-structured and uses standard APIs; no unsafe data handling or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for customizing Sphinx documentation roles, using safe, well-known methods. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
