The main security concern is the use of dynamic import with untrusted input, which could lead to execution of malicious modules if module names are not validated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score should be set around 0.3 to reflect the moderate risk associated with unvalidated dynamic imports."
