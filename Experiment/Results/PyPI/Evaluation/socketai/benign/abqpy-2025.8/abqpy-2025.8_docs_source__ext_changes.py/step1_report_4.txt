  "purpose": "Custom Sphinx builder for generating a markdown file listing API changes based on changesets.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values ('changes_write_to', 'changes_versions') and changesets via 'domain.get_changesets_for'.",
  "sinks": "Writes the generated markdown documentation to a file specified by 'changes_write_to' in the configuration.",
  "flows": "Configuration values and changesets are read as sources, processed into formatted text, and then written to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code mainly interacts with Sphinx APIs and file system.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Sphinx builder that extracts change set information from the 'changeset' domain, formats it into markdown, and writes it to a specified file. The use of 'Path' to write to a file is standard. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling observed. It primarily manipulates data from the Sphinx environment and writes to a file, which is typical for documentation generators. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate custom builder for Sphinx intended for documentation purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
