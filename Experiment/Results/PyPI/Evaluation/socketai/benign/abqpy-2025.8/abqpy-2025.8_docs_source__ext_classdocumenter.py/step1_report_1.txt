  "purpose": "Customizes Sphinx autodoc to add toggle sections for class members",
  "sources": "Imports from sphinx.application, sphinx.ext.autodoc; method calls within document_members and setup functions",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; code primarily configures documentation extension",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns; straightforward Sphinx extension setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom class for Sphinx documentation that modifies how class members are documented by adding toggle sections. The setup function registers the custom class with Sphinx and enables relevant extensions. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious network activity. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard customization of Sphinx documentation, focusing on UI presentation enhancements without any malicious intent or security risks.",
