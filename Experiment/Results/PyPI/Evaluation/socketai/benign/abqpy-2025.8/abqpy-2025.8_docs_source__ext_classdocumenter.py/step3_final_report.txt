  "purpose": "Customize Sphinx autodoc to add toggle sections for class members in documentation.",
  "sources": "Standard Sphinx modules, class methods, and setup function calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external inputs, or network activity; purely internal method calls.",
  "flows": "Method calls within the class and setup function; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward extension customization with no suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Sphinx's ClassDocumenter to add toggle sections for class members, and a setup function to register extensions and override default behavior. It involves no external data, network activity, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward customization of Sphinx documentation generation, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
