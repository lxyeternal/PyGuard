{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for a Python package, dynamically determining the version of 'abqpy' dependency based on the project's SCM version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information using 'setuptools_scm.get_version' and attempts to import 'setuptools_scm'. It also reads the 'root' parameter and the version string.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic version string is used directly in 'install_requires' during setup, potentially affecting installation behavior. No untrusted data is used in critical sinks beyond package dependency specification.",
  "flows": "The version string obtained from 'setuptools_scm.get_version' flows into the formatted dependency string 'abqpy=={version}', which is then used by the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally defaults to a static version '2025.*' if 'setuptools_scm' is unavailable or a lookup error occurs, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically determine the 'abqpy' package version via 'setuptools_scm'. It handles exceptions gracefully, defaulting to a static version if necessary. The use of 're.match' to parse version strings is straightforward. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The overall code appears to be standard setup logic with conditional fallback, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for dynamically resolving package dependencies, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The fallback to a static version is unusual but benign. No malware or security threats are identified.",
