  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a setup script that dynamically determines the version of the 'abqpy' dependency using 'setuptools_scm'.\n- The code handles exceptions gracefully, defaulting to '2025.*' if 'setuptools_scm' is unavailable or version retrieval fails.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- The fallback version '2025.*' is unconventional but not malicious; it appears to be a placeholder or future version indicator.\n- The logic is standard for version management in Python packaging.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code does **not** contain malicious or harmful logic.\n- The fallback version '2025.*' is unusual but not inherently problematic or malicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is the use of a future version string ('2025.*') as a fallback, which could cause installation issues if the dependency manager interprets this as an invalid version. However, this is not a security flaw.\n- No actual code errors are present.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** Low (~0.1 to 0.2), justified by the fallback version being unconventional but not dangerous.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly high (0.9 to 1), which seems appropriate given the clear and standard logic.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- No basis for higher risk; the code is standard and safe.\n- The fallback version could be considered a minor concern if it leads to installation failures, but not a security risk.\n\n### Potential Claims about Vulnerabilities:\n- No claims are based on assumptions; the code is transparent.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation that could hide malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to unconventional fallback, but not security-critical)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor concern about fallback version, but not a security issue)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.**",
