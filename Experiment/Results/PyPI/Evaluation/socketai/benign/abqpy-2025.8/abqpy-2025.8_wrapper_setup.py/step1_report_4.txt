{
  "purpose": "This script configures package setup by dynamically determining the version of the 'abqpy' dependency based on the current project's version control metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'setuptools_scm' module to get version information, importing 're' module for regex matching, and reading the 'root' directory path in 'setuptools_scm.get_version'.",
  "sinks": "Using the obtained version to set 'install_requires' in the setup configuration, which could influence the environment installation process.",
  "flows": "Importing 'setuptools_scm' -> retrieving version -> parsing version string -> setting dependency in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The version retrieval depends on an external package ('setuptools_scm') and handles exceptions gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the 'abqpy' package version via 'setuptools_scm'. If successful, it extracts major and minor version numbers for precise dependency specification. If not, it defaults to '2025.*'. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The usage is straightforward and consistent with standard setup practices. No external data is being transmitted or hidden actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a legitimate setup function to specify a dependency version dynamically. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious anomalies. The fallback version '2025.*' could be unusual, but it's not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe.",
