  "purpose": "Dynamically determine the version of 'abqpy' using 'setuptools_scm' and fallback to '2025.*' if unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import of 'setuptools_scm' and retrieval of version string; regex parsing of version.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external output affecting security.",
  "flows": "Attempt to get version -> parse version -> set dependency string; fallback to default if error occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Fallback version '2025.*' is unconventional; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard dynamic versioning with exception handling. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are detected. The fallback version '2025.*' is unusual but not malicious, potentially causing installation issues but not security risks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.1), justified by the unconventional fallback but no actual security concern. The malware score is zero, as no malicious activity is present. Confidence in these conclusions is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for dependency versioning, with an unconventional but non-malicious fallback. No security vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
