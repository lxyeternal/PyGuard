{
  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration that dynamically determines the version of 'abqpy' to install based on the current project's version control system.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current project version using 'setuptools_scm' to obtain version info from the source control metadata.",
  "sinks": "The version string derived from 'setuptools_scm' is used directly in the install_requires list, which influences package installation dependencies.",
  "flows": "The source (version retrieved via 'setuptools_scm') flows into the string formatting used in 'install_requires' to specify the 'abqpy' version.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback version '2025.*' is hardcoded, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; the use of 'setuptools_scm' for versioning is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to dynamically determine the 'abqpy' version from version control metadata using 'setuptools_scm'. If this process fails, it defaults to a static version pattern '2025.*'. The code imports 'setuptools' and 're', uses a try-except block to handle missing dependencies or errors, and constructs a version string accordingly. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code's behavior is consistent with standard package setup procedures, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a typical dynamic version retrieval for package dependencies during setup, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles errors and falls back to a safe default. No malicious activity or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
