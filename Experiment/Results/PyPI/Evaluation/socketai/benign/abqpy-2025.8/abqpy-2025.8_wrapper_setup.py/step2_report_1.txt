  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code attempts to dynamically determine the version of `abqpy` using `setuptools_scm.get_version()`.\n- If `setuptools_scm` is not available or an error occurs, it defaults to `\"2025.*\"`.\n- The version string from `setuptools_scm` is parsed with a regex to extract major and minor parts.\n- The resulting dependency is set as `abqpy==<major>.<minor>`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validity of the Reported Issues\n\n**Are the issues present?**\n\n- The fallback version `\"2025.*\"` is unusual but not malicious. It could cause installation issues if no matching package exists, but this is a configuration concern, not a security issue.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The logic is straightforward, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is standard for dynamic dependency management, with an unusual fallback version but no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n\n- All reports correctly note that the fallback `\"2025.*\"` is unconventional but not malicious.\n- They acknowledge that the code is standard setup logic, with exception handling for missing `setuptools_scm`.\n- No report points out actual code errors or security flaws, which aligns with the code.\n\n**Note:** No errors or flaws are evident in the logic or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly varied but generally low (~0.1–0.2). Given the code's nature, this is reasonable.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**\n\n- Yes, the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Risks and Assumptions\n\n- The fallback version `\"2025.*\"` could lead to install failures if such a version does not exist, but this is a configuration concern, not security.\n- No claims or evidence suggest malicious intent or malicious code injection.\n- The dependency on `setuptools_scm` is standard; no suspicious data flows are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to the unusual fallback version, but not security-related)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical setup script employing `setuptools_scm` for version management, with a fallback to `\"2025.*\"`. The fallback is unconventional but not malicious. No security vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe, and the reports are accurate.",
