{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for handling biological sequence data, particularly FASTA files, amino acid alphabets, batching for model input, and a dataset class for structural protein data, intended for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations (open, read, pickle.load), data parsing (read_alignment_lines, read_fasta), external download functions (download_url), environment variables (os.path, Path), user inputs via file paths and parameters.",
  "sinks": "File writing (pickle.load), network download via download_url, file system access, environment variable access (os.path), potential use of external libraries for data processing.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files or network (download_url), parsed or deserialized (open, pickle.load), processed within classes (e.g., tokenization, batching), stored or returned for downstream ML tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features. No signs of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured data processing module for bioinformatics applications. It includes file reading, parsing, data batching, and dataset preparation with no signs of malicious activities. Usage of pickle.load could pose security risks if untrusted data sources are involved, but within this context, it seems to be used for standard data loading. The download function uses a trusted URL, and no arbitrary code execution or network activity beyond this is evident. There are no embedded or hidden commands, and no anomalous data flows or side effects suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and intended for biological data processing for machine learning. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It follows expected patterns for such applications and does not perform any suspicious actions outside normal data handling. Therefore, it can be considered safe in its current context.",
