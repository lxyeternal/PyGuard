  "conclusion": "The code is primarily legitimate bioinformatics data handling with a known security risk associated with untrusted pickle files. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is observed. The main mitigation is ensuring pickle files are from trusted sources. The overall security risk is moderate due to this deserialization step, but the code itself is not malicious."
