  "purpose": "Data handling for bioinformatics sequences, including reading FASTA files, tokenization, batching, and dataset management.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations such as open(), reading from URLs, and pickle.load() for deserializing datasets.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization via pickle.load(), which can execute arbitrary code if the pickle files are malicious.",
  "flows": "Reading files from disk or network, then passing pickle files to pickle.load() for deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle.load() on potentially untrusted files; no other suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks with straightforward structure. The primary security concern is the use of pickle.load() on files that could be malicious if sourced from untrusted origins. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or network-based malicious behavior is present. The deserialization step is a known vector for code execution but is acceptable if the data sources are verified and trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily legitimate bioinformatics data handling with a known security risk associated with untrusted pickle files. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is observed. The main mitigation is ensuring pickle files are from trusted sources. The overall security risk is moderate due to this deserialization step, but the code itself is not malicious.",
