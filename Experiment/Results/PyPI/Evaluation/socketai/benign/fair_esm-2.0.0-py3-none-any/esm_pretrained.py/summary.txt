  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured model loader with no active malicious behavior. The main security risk lies in deserializing potentially malicious data from external sources, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if the data is compromised. No backdoors or obfuscation are detected. The current low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate, but the deserialization risk warrants a higher malware score. Overall, the code is safe if sources are trusted, but caution is advised regarding external data integrity."
