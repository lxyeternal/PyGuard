  "purpose": "Load a protein folding model either from a local file or a remote URL, validate its keys, and initialize the ESMFold model instance.",
  "sources": "torch.load for local files; torch.hub.load_state_dict_from_url for remote URL; model data dicts containing 'cfg' and 'model' keys.",
  "sinks": "model.load_state_dict applies the model weights; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input model_name (local path or URL) -> load model data -> validate keys -> load into ESMFold -> return model.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; straightforward model loading and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard model loading procedures with validation of expected keys, from either local files or trusted URLs. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The URL used for remote loading is from a reputable source. The validation ensures model integrity. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are detected. The process is transparent and aligns with best practices for model deployment. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external URL fetches, which are from a trusted source. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified given the external fetch from a reputable source. Overall, the dependency is secure and appropriate for use.",
