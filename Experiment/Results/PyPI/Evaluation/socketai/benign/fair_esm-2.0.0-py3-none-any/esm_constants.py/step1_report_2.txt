  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of protein sequence tokens for use in bioinformatics or machine learning models.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data read; static dictionary definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be a straightforward static data definition with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python dictionary defining protein sequence tokens, with comments indicating licensing and formatting directives. No input/output operations, network connections, or data processing are present. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static data declaration for protein tokens, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
