{
  "purpose": "Define a dictionary containing protein sequence tokens, likely for bioinformatics processing.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; static dictionary definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static data structure definition without any data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard dictionary definition with comments and formatting directives.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no external input, does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. It only defines a static dictionary mapping token labels to a list of amino acid characters. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The comments indicate code formatting control, which is benign. The license comment refers to legal licensing but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, harmless definition of protein tokens for use in bioinformatics applications. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified.",
