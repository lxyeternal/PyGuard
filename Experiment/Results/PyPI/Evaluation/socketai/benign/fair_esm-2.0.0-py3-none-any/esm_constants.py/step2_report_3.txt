  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the correctness of their conclusions, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code in question is a static Python dictionary defining protein sequence tokens.\n- No dynamic data, external input, network activity, or cryptographic operations are present.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a straightforward dictionary assignment, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.\n- **Behavior:** Static data, no data flow from untrusted sources, no external communication.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware score 0, which is consistent.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign obfuscated score 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature.\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- The **securityRisk** score is 0 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The **malware** score is 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated** score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Logical flaws or assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all conclude benign static data.\n- No reports suggest any hidden malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- The comments about licensing and formatting are benign and do not impact security.\n\n### Any inconsistencies or unreasonable scores?\n- All scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- The confidence level is 1, which is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- No evidence suggests any risk or malicious intent.\n- The code is a benign static resource, typical in bioinformatics projects.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a simple, static dictionary defining protein sequence tokens with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's nature.",
