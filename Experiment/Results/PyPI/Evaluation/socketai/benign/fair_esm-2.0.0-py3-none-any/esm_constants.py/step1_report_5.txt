{
  "purpose": "Define a dictionary containing a list of protein sequence tokens, likely for use in bioinformatics processing or modeling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionary 'proteinseq_toks' with a list of token characters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; no external data input or network operations.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only defines a static data structure without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports no data, performs a straightforward assignment of a static dictionary with a list of protein tokens, and contains no executable or network-related operations. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that handle external data, and no flow paths that could lead to security issues. The code appears to be a simple data definition with comments and formatting instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static data structure defining protein sequence tokens. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
