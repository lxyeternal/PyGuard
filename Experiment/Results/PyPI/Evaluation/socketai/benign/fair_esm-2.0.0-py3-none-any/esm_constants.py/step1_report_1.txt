  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of protein sequence tokens, likely for use in bioinformatics or sequence processing.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionary `proteinseq_toks` containing token list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is a straightforward static data structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple dictionary assignment defining protein sequence tokens, with no dynamic input, no external data processing, no network communication, and no cryptographic or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a static resource for downstream processing. The only code is a dictionary initialization with a list of characters relevant to protein sequences. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign static data definition intended for use in bioinformatics tasks. There are no malicious behaviors or security concerns associated with this code.",
