  "purpose": "Define a static list of amino acid tokens used in bioinformatics processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static data assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a static data structure with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static dictionary containing a list of amino acid tokens, with licensing comments and formatting directives. It does not process data, perform network communication, or execute any logic beyond static assignment. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The confidence level is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static resource defining protein tokens, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
