{
  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of protein sequence tokens, likely for use in biological sequence processing or modeling.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data is hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not perform any data output, database access, or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occurring; the code is static and only defines a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and related to biological data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a dictionary with a list of protein tokens, which appears to be part of a biological or bioinformatics application. It contains licensing comments and a dictionary definition. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable logic that could lead to malicious behavior. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data definition for protein sequence tokens. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
