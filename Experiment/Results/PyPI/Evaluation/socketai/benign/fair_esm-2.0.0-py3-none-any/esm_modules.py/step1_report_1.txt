{
  "purpose": "The code implements various neural network layers and modules for transformer-based models, primarily for contact prediction, language modeling, and attention mechanisms in protein sequences.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from tensors such as 'x', 'tokens', and 'attentions'. Data is also loaded into embedding layers and positional encodings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include linear layers, normalization layers, and attention mechanisms that process or transform input tensors, potentially leading to information leakage if untrusted data is supplied.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow through normalization, attention, feedforward layers, and projection layers. Data from input tensors flows into embedding, attention modules, and finally into output layers like regression or language modeling heads.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious functions are present. The code uses standard libraries and patterns typical for transformer architectures. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of transformer modules, including normalization, attention, residual blocks, and position embeddings. It includes conditional imports for optimized layer normalization, but these are not malicious. The use of attention, linear transformations, and activations is consistent with standard practices. No data leaks, network calls, or suspicious operations are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate model implementation for protein contact prediction or language modeling tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of transformer-based neural network modules with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard practices and libraries, and no suspicious functions or data flows are observed. The overall security risk is negligible.",
