{
  "purpose": "The code implements various neural network layers and modules for transformer-based models, likely for protein or sequence analysis, including attention mechanisms, positional embeddings, and contact prediction.",
  "sources": "Imports from torch, torch.nn, and local modules such as multihead_attention, axial_attention. No external or untrusted input sources are evident; code primarily defines classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data, network communication, or data exfiltration are present. Functions perform internal computations, tensor operations, and model layer definitions.",
  "flows": "The code initializes and processes data through neural network layers, with no data flow to external systems or network interfaces; data flows within the model architecture for training or inference.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for deep learning model definitions, with no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All classes and functions serve typical model purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple modules and functions for transformer layers, attention mechanisms, positional embeddings, and prediction heads. It imports standard libraries and a conditional import for fused layer norm, with fallback. No network or file I/O, environment variable access, or system commands are present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual behavior are evident. The code structure and comments are consistent with common deep learning practices. The only notable potential concern is the conditional import of apex for fused layer norm, which is standard optimization code, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of transformer modules with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to define model components without any suspicious operations, external data leaks, or malicious behaviors.",
