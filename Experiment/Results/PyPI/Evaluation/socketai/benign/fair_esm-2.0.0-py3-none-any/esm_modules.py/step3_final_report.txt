  "purpose": "Implementation of transformer modules, attention mechanisms, positional embeddings, and contact prediction heads for protein or sequence modeling.",
  "sources": "Internal tensor operations, model inputs (e.g., token tensors), and parameters; no external data sources or untrusted input reading evident.",
  "sinks": "Data flows within model layers; no external network calls, data leaks, or side effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow through normalization, attention, feedforward, and output layers; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected. Use of conditional apex import is standard optimization, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard transformer components, including attention, normalization, positional embeddings, and contact prediction heads. No external data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The conditional import of apex for fused layer normalization is a common optimization. The code is well-structured, clear, and aligns with typical open-source implementations for protein modeling. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the security risk score is conservatively low (~0.1), reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of transformer modules for protein or sequence modeling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the overall security posture is negligible.",
