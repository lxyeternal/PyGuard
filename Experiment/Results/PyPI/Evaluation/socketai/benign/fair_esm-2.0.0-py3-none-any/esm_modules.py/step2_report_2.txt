  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code implements standard transformer modules, attention, normalization, positional embeddings, and contact prediction heads. No external data sources or untrusted input reading is indicated.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows internally within model components; no external side effects or data leaks are evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. Use of conditional apex import is standard optimization, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is benign and standard is well-supported. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 seems conservative but acceptable given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard model definitions, no external data or network activity, and no suspicious code patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is reasonable; the overall assessment is that this is standard code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, the code defines transformer modules, with no external data leaks, network calls, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 fits.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is acceptable; the code appears benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- The code is described as standard for protein modeling, with no malicious activities or suspicious operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 is justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: standard transformer modules, no external data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical implementation of transformer modules for protein or sequence modeling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior in any report.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low (0 or 0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose and lack of suspicious behavior, a conservative but justified overall risk score would be around **0.1**.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided assessments.** The code appears to be a standard, open-source transformer implementation for protein contact prediction, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the code's benign and standard nature, with minimal security concern.",
