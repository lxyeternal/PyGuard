  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. It correctly identifies the code as a typical transformer implementation for protein contact prediction.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Justification:** Given the detailed review, the low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The securityRisk is set at 0.2, which is slightly cautious but acceptable given the code's nature—no external network activity or data leaks are evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no suspicious patterns, no external data sources, and no malicious code. It emphasizes standard practices and the conditional import of apex for optimization, which is common.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk could be marginally increased to 0.1 for caution, but 0 is acceptable given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly increasing securityRisk to 0.1 would be more consistent, but 0 is still reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, no anomalies, no suspicious code, no external network activity. It notes the conditional import of apex, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Justification:** The scores are consistent with the analysis. No issues detected.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, no external data leaks, or suspicious code. It correctly identifies the code as typical for protein modeling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, it finds no malicious activity, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Justification:** The slight increase to 0.1 for securityRisk is reasonable, considering the potential for untrusted input in real deployment, but the code itself appears benign.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nBased on the detailed reviews, I concur with the provided scores. The overall risk appears negligible, and the code seems safe for use.\n\n### My personal estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to potential untrusted input in real deployment, but not evident here)\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**  \n- The code is a typical transformer implementation for protein modeling, with no external network calls or data leaks.  \n- No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.  \n- Conditional imports and standard functions are common and not malicious.  \n- The low scores reflect the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with minimal security risk, and no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
