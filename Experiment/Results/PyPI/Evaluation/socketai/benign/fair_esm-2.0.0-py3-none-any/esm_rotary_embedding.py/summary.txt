  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of rotary positional embeddings with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with a slight overestimation of security risk in one case. The overall security risk is effectively zero, and the malware score is zero."
