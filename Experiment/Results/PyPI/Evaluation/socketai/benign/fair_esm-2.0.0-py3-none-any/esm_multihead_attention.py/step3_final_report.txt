  "purpose": "Implementation of multi-head attention mechanism with support for incremental state, rotary embeddings, and ONNX export compatibility.",
  "sources": "Internal state management via uuid.uuid4(), linear projections for query, key, value, and output, rotary embedding initialization, and input tensors (query, key, value).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow through projection layers, with internal state managed via uuid-based keys, and attention weights computed via batch matrix multiplication. No external data or network flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of uuid for internal state IDs is routine; no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard multi-head attention module with well-understood patterns. Internal state management uses uuid for unique identification, which is common practice. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The attention computations follow established patterns, and the placeholder function 'apply_sparse_mask' does nothing suspicious. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation techniques are employed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of multi-head attention with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of uuid for internal state is routine and not indicative of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
