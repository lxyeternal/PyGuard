  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment header and a single assignment statement setting 'version' to '2.0.0'. There are no input reading, no external calls, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials beyond the version string, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a standard package or module metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
