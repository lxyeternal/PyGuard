  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software component.",
  "sources": "Comments and the assignment of the 'version' variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version string assignment with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single assignment statement setting 'version' to '2.0.0'. There are no inputs, external calls, data flows, or suspicious constructs. The code is simple, clear, and serves as metadata. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with licensing comments. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
