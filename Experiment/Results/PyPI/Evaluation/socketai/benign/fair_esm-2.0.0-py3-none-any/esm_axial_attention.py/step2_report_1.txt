  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as implementing self-attention over 2D inputs, matching the code's classes. Input tensors and linear layers are accurately described.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity; tensor flow is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes unimplemented features raising NotImplementedError, which is accurate. No malicious intent inferred.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the code appears standard, with incomplete masking features but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — seems reasonable given the code's nature and lack of malicious signals.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurately describing the code.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights unimplemented masking, which is correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code is standard, with incomplete features but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, reasonable, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions unimplemented `NotImplementedError` for masking, which is true.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is standard, with incomplete masking features, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and balanced.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes unimplemented masking, which is accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately describes the code as standard, incomplete masking features, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — slightly lower risk score, reflecting minimal concern, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions unimplemented masking, which is true.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is typical, with incomplete features but no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code matches the descriptions; no discrepancies.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's straightforward, standard implementation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting incomplete masking features but no malicious activity.\n\n### Critical Analysis & Recommendations:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the incomplete masking functionality (raising NotImplementedError). This is not malicious but indicates incomplete development.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or external data exfiltration.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to incomplete features, not malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard implementation of attention modules with incomplete masking features, which do not pose security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.",
