{
  "purpose": "Implement self-attention mechanisms over rows and columns of 2D input tensors, likely for use in a neural network model for sequence or structural data processing.",
  "sources": "Reading input tensors `x`, environment variables, and parameters during class initialization and forward passes.",
  "sinks": "Linear projections (`nn.Linear`) and tensor operations that process or transform input data; no data is explicitly sent over network or written to files within this code.",
  "flows": "Input tensors `x` flow through projections (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`) to compute attention weights, which are then used to generate context vectors and produce output tensors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations detected. The code contains unimplemented NotImplementedError placeholders for attention masks, which is normal during development. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or covert data manipulations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two self-attention modules with standard implementations: RowSelfAttention and ColumnSelfAttention. Both use linear projections, scaled dot-product attention, masking (with NotImplementedError placeholders), and dropout. No network communication, file operations, or hidden behaviors are observed. The only minor concern is the unimplemented mask functionality, which suggests incomplete or development-stage code, not malicious intent. No suspicious data leaks, credential handling, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of self-attention mechanisms for neural network models, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The presence of unimplemented mask features indicates incomplete code, not malicious intent.",
