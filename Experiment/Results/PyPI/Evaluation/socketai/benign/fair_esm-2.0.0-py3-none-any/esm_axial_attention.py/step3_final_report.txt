  "purpose": "Implementation of self-attention mechanisms over rows and columns of 2D input tensors, enabling contextual modeling in neural network architectures.",
  "sources": "Input tensors 'x' (features), projection layers (k_proj, v_proj, q_proj), and optional attention masks.",
  "sinks": "Attention weight tensors, output feature tensors; no external data or network operations involved.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are projected to queries, keys, and values; attention weights are computed via einsum; attention probabilities are derived and used to update representations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'raise NotImplementedError' in attention mask handling functions indicates incomplete feature implementation; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard self-attention modules with separate row-wise and column-wise variants, utilizing linear projections and einsum operations. The unimplemented masking features suggest ongoing development but do not introduce malicious behavior. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated constructs are present. The attention mechanisms are straightforward, and the incomplete features are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of attention modules with incomplete masking functionality. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The minor incomplete features do not elevate the security risk significantly.",
