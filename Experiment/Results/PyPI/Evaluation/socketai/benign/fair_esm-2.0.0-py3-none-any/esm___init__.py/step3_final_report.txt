  "purpose": "Package initialization for a bioinformatics library, importing core modules and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.version, .data, .model, .pretrained). No input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static imports without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements, license comments, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements and license comments, typical for a package's __init__.py. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and standard for open-source Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
