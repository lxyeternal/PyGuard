{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to define package imports for a bioinformatics library related to protein modeling and datasets, primarily by importing modules and classes from submodules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and submodules within the package (version, data, model, pretrained).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external commands are present; only internal module references.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution observed. The code is straightforward, mainly import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and several components related to protein datasets and models, including pretrained models. There are no functions, user inputs, or external data sources. No evidence of malicious code such as network activity, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. The presence of copyright notice from Facebook and standard licensing comments suggests legitimate intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected in the static import statements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of import statements for a legitimate bioinformatics library. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. The code’s purpose is to make various components available within the package for use in applications related to protein modeling.",
