{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and components related to protein modeling and data handling, likely for a bioinformatics application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .version, .data, .model.esm1, .model.esm2, .model.msa_transformer, and .pretrained.",
  "sinks": "None of the import statements involve handling untrusted data or user input; they are static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this snippet; it only imports modules without executing data processing or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The license comment indicates open-source, and import statements are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import of modules related to protein models, data handling, and versioning. It appears to be a typical setup file for a package, with no dynamic code execution, external network connections, or suspicious behaviors. The code comments are standard licensing notices, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical package initialization script that imports components for a bioinformatics library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
