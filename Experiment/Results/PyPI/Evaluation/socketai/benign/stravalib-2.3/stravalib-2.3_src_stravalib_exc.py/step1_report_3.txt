{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exceptions, warnings, and helper functions for error handling and deprecation notices in the stravalib package, mainly for API interaction error management.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, functions, and constants without external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions are present. No data leaks or external system interactions are initiated.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines error classes and warning functions without dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. All elements are straightforward class and function definitions for error handling and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The script establishes a structured hierarchy of exception classes for handling specific API errors and rate limits, along with functions to issue deprecation and support warnings for the API usage. It imports standard modules and uses warnings and logging configurations appropriately. No dynamic code execution, user input processing, or external data handling is present. The code is purely definitional and documentation-oriented, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module for error and warning management in a Python API client library. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious anomalies, or security threats detected.",
