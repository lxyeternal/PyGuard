{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and warning functions for error handling and deprecation notices in the stravalib API client.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and warning functions that generate warnings based on usage.",
  "sinks": "Warnings generated by the warn_* functions; no untrusted data processing or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; warnings are triggered by function calls with specific parameters, but no external or malicious data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of warnings for deprecation and unsupported features is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for error handling and functions to issue warnings about deprecated or unsupported features. All exception classes are straightforward and inherit from Python's built-in exception types, with no evidence of malicious behavior. Warning functions provide user guidance on deprecated or unsupported API features but do not perform any risky operations or external data handling. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. Overall, the code is standard, well-structured, and intended for API error management and user notification without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed for error handling and deprecation warnings in the stravalib client library, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
