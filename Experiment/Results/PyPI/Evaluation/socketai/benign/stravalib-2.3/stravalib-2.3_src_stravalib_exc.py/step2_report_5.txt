  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining exception classes and warning functions for error handling and deprecation notices within the stravalib client library.\n- The code is primarily static class and function definitions with no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are reported.\n- The purpose is to facilitate error management, user notification, and API deprecation handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any malicious payloads.\n- All exception classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or requests.exceptions, with no evidence of sabotage.\n- Warning functions generate user guidance messages but do not execute risky operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No malicious behavior or security issues are present.** The code is a benign utility module.\n\n---\n\n### Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code structure and comments are clear.\n- No signs of security flaws, such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears correct, well-structured, and free of mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign **0**. This is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign **0** or **0.0**. Correct, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign **0**. This is justified since there are no security risks.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo, the scores seem accurate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score; the code is purely definitional and documentation-oriented.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe risk scores are appropriate at 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Malware Score:\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The warning functions only generate user notifications; exception classes are standard.\n\n**Appropriate malware score:** **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malware are warranted here.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**These scores reflect the benign, utility nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard, well-structured utility module for error handling and deprecation warnings in the stravalib library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and purely for error/warning management.",
