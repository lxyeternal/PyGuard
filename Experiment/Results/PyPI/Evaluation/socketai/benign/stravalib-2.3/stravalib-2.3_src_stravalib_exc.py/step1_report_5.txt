{
  "purpose": "This code provides custom exception classes, warning functions, and error handling utilities for the stravalib Python library, primarily for interacting with the Strava API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (e.g., message strings, class types, attribute names) and imports from standard libraries and requests.exceptions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to files, network, or environment variables. Warnings and exceptions are generated based on inputs but do not lead to direct data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as parameters in warning functions flow into warning messages, and exception objects are created based on errors encountered during API interactions. These are then raised or logged.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists of standard exception classes and warning functions. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling in a specific API context, including rate limits and authentication issues. It also includes several warning functions designed to inform developers about deprecated or unsupported features. The functions utilize the warnings module to generate warnings with appropriate stack levels, and exception classes extend from built-in exceptions or requests.exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code appears to be straightforward utility code for a public SDK/library, with no external communication, data storage, or risky code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of error and warning utilities for the stravalib library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, maintains good practices, and serves its purpose as part of an API client library without introducing security concerns.",
