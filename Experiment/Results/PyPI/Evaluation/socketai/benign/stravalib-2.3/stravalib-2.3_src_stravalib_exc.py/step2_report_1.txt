  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code defines exception classes and warning functions for error handling and deprecation notices within the stravalib library.\n- They emphasize that the code is straightforward, with no data processing, external system interactions, or malicious behaviors.\n- The warnings are used solely for informing users about deprecated or unsupported features.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The code's purpose is primarily maintenance, documentation, and user notification.\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Malware score justification:** Since the code only defines exceptions and warnings, with no external data handling, network activity, or code injection, the malware score should be **0**.\n- **Security risk:** No security risks are apparent; the code is purely utility and error handling.\n\n**Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or payloads)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final justification:**\n\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and typical for an SDK's error handling module.\n- No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The warnings serve to inform users about deprecations, which is standard practice.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, with no security risks or malware. The provided scores in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated scores, with a risk score of zero.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
