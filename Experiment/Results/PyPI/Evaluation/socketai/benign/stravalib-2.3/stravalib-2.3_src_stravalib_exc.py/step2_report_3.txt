  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes for handling various API errors, such as authentication issues, rate limits, upload failures, etc.\n   - It also provides multiple warning functions to inform users about deprecated, unsupported, or unofficial features.\n   - All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or requests.exceptions, and the functions generate warnings with clear messages.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, external system interactions, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Security Risks**:\n   - The code is purely definitional: exception classes and warning functions.\n   - No external data sources are read, no data is written to files or network, and no command execution occurs.\n   - No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.\n   - The warnings serve to inform users about deprecated or unsupported features, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score**: Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or risky behavior, a score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Errors or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues.\n   - No overestimations or underestimations of risk are evident.\n   - The explanations are thorough and justified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is for error handling and warnings, its primary purpose is user notification and exception management, not data processing.\n   - The use of warnings for deprecation and support notices is standard and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and intended for API error management.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- I agree with the reports' assessments.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and contains no security concerns.",
