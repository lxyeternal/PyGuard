{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and warning functions for error handling, deprecation notices, and user guidance within the stravalib library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions and functions generating warnings, primarily static code with no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; functions only issue warnings and define exceptions without external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A – static definitions; no data flow or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions and functions issuing warnings about deprecated or unsupported features. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or code execution. The warning functions are straightforward, serving user notification purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is typical for an SDK's error handling module, with clear structure and comments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely utility-based, and contains no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard for error handling and user notification in a library context. The malware, obfuscation, and risk scores should all remain at zero.",
