  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is solely defining exception classes and warning functions. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, obfuscated code, or any malicious payloads. The code is straightforward, using standard Python constructs for error handling and user warnings.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic:**  \n   The reports do not identify any logical flaws or errors. The exception classes inherit from appropriate built-in exceptions, and the warning functions are well-structured to inform users about deprecated or unsupported features. The code appears clean, maintainable, and standard for a library utility module.\n\n3. **Scores Given and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware score: 0 or 0.0\n   - Obfuscated: 0 or 0.0\n   - Security risk: 0 or 0.0  \n   \n   These are reasonable given the code's nature. The code does not perform any external data processing or risky operations.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign high risk scores. All are at zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as purely utility functions for error handling and warnings, with no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility module for error handling and user warnings within the stravalib SDK. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Work-through summary:**  \nAll reports agree on the benign nature. Based on the detailed review, I concur with their assessments. The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
