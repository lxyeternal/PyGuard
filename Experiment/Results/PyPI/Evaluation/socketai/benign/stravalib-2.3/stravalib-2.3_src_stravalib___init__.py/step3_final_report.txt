  "purpose": "Import the Client class from stravalib and handle versioning with a fallback to 'unreleased'.",
  "sources": "Import from stravalib.client; import of __version__ from local module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "N/A; straightforward import and fallback pattern",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import pattern, no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external library and attempts to import a version string from a local module, defaulting to 'unreleased' if the import fails. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The pattern is common for version handling in Python modules. No external data flows, network activity, or untrusted input handling are present. The code is simple, clear, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero. No modifications are necessary.",
