  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: importing a class from `stravalib.client` and attempting to import a version string from a local module, with a fallback.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior is detected or suspected.\n\n**Issue presence confirmation:**\n- The code matches the descriptions; it does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign a security risk and malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence level is 1, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n**Potential points of critique or concern:**\n- Since the code is standard and simple, there are no grounds to increase the malware or risk scores.\n- The only minor point is that the version import relies on a local module which might be generated or optional, but this is common practice and not suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malware detected.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical module setup for a package, with safe import patterns. No issues or threats are present.",
