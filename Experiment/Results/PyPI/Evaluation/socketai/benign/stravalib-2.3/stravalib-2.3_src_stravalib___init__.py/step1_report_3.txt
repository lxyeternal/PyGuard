{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up the import of a Client class from the stravalib library and manage version information.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Client from stravalib.client, and optional import of __version__ from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points that process untrusted input or could leak data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external untrusted sources; the code only imports modules and sets a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import statements and a simple try-except block.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a known open-source library (stravalib), which is legitimate. The try-except block attempts to import a version variable from a local module, falling back to a default string if not available. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure is typical and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with harmless imports and version handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
