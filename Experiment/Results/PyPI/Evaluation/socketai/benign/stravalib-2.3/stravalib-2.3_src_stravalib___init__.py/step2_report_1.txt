  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward module that imports a class from an external library (`stravalib.client`) and attempts to import a version string from a local module, defaulting to \"unreleased\" if the import fails.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors across all reports.\n- The code is standard, with no external data flows, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- The scores assigned are consistently zero for malware and security risk, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic or reasoning of the reports.\n- The import statements and fallback pattern are common and safe.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- None are apparent. The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all as 0, which is appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable; all scores are zero, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Correctly assigned as 0 in all reports. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical module setup with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and poses no security threat.",
