  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code snippets.\n- The code imports a class from an external library (`stravalib.client`) and attempts to import a version string from a local module, defaulting to \"unreleased\" if the import fails.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, with standard patterns for module setup and version handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors or mistakes?**  \n  **None.** The code appears correct and typical for a module setup.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the lack of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Justification for any higher scores:**  \n  No reason exists to justify higher scores. The code is benign.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  None. The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities; they simply analyze the code as standard.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough analysis, I agree with the existing scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final scores:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0**",
