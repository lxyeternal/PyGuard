  "purpose": "Define module exports and handle version import for the stravalib package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from stravalib.client, and attempt to import __version__ from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block to conditionally set __version__, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Client class from stravalib.client, sets the __all__ variable for exports, and attempts to import a version string from a local module, defaulting to 'unreleased' if ImportError occurs. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module setup with standard import handling. No malicious intent, no security risks identified.",
