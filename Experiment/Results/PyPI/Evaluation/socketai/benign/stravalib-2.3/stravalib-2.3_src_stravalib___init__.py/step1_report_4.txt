{
  "purpose": "Defines a module that imports the 'Client' class from 'stravalib.client' and sets a version string, handling potential import errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'stravalib.client' and optional import of '__version__' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks due to static imports and assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Simple conditional import with no suspicious code or hidden behaviors; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external library and attempts to import a version string from a local module, defaulting to 'unreleased' if unavailable. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or obfuscated behaviors. The code is straightforward and common for package version handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs basic imports and version handling without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
