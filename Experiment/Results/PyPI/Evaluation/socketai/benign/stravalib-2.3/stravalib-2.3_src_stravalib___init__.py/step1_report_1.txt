{
  "purpose": "Define a module that exposes the Client class from stravalib and attempts to import a version identifier.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from stravalib.client import Client' and conditional import of '__version__' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is sent or written to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The version import is standard practice with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Client class from a third-party library, which is normal. It defines '__all__' to control exports. The try-except block for importing '__version__' is a common pattern to handle optional or generated version info. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, standard, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It serves as a typical module setup for a package with no security risks identified.",
