{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'Client' class from the 'stravalib' library and attempts to set the module's version from a generated file or defaults to 'unreleased'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports a library and reads a version file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause a data leak or effect.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely handles imports and module versioning.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains minimal logic with straightforward imports. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external library, which is a standard practice. It attempts to import a version string from a local module, falling back to a default string if the import fails. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger package, with no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
