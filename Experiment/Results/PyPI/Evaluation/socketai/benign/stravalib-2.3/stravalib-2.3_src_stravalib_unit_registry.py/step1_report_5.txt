{
  "purpose": "Define a unit registry and a quantity class for handling physical units using the 'pint' library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the 'pint' library; instantiation of 'UnitRegistry()' object; assignment of 'ureg.Quantity' to 'Q_'",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only library initialization and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pint' library, creates a unit registry object, and assigns the 'Quantity' class to a variable. This is a standard initialization pattern for using the 'pint' library for unit management. No external data input, no network activity, no sensitive data handling or obfuscated logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for using the 'pint' library to handle physical units. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security issues, or suspicious behavior.",
