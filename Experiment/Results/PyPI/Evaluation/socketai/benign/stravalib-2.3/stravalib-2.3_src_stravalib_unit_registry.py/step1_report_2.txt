  "purpose": "Initialize a unit registry and define a quantity function for handling units with the 'pint' library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the 'pint' library, creating an instance of UnitRegistry, defining 'Q_' as a shortcut for Quantity.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data or input flows into untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only sets up the library and defines a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for 'pint' usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pint' library, creates a UnitRegistry instance, and defines 'Q_' as a shortcut for 'ureg.Quantity'. There are no input/output operations, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears to serve as a setup for unit calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for initializing 'pint' for unit conversions or calculations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
