  "purpose": "Initialize the 'pint' library for unit management by creating a UnitRegistry instance and assigning its Quantity attribute for later use.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pint' library; creation of 'UnitRegistry' object; assignment of 'ureg.Quantity' to 'Q_'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pint' -> creation of 'UnitRegistry' -> assignment to 'Q_' (no data flow to external sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard library usage with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library, creates a registry object, and assigns a class attribute to a variable. It contains no external data handling, no obfuscated or malicious code, and follows typical usage patterns. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The code is benign setup code for unit handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard initialization code for the 'pint' library, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
