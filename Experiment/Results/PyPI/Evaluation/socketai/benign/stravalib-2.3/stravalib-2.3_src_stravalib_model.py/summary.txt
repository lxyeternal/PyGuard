  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data model and utility layer for a Strava API client, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The only potential risk stems from network calls in lazy properties, which are expected and controlled. Overall, the code is safe, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1)."
