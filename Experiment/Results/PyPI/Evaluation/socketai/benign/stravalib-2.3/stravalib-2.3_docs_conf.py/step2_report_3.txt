  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the logical reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The only notable external package used is 'stravalib', which is imported solely to retrieve version info.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The functions and setup code are typical for documentation configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, external data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The import of 'stravalib' is for version retrieval, which is standard practice.\n- No evidence of code injection, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusion that the code is safe is justified.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- All reports assign **malware = 0** and **securityRisk = 0**, which is appropriate.\n- The **obfuscated** score is 0, which is correct.\n- The **risk score** is 0 or very close to it, reflecting no security concern.\n- The **confidence** scores are high (1 or 0.95), matching the clear benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are detected, **malware = 0** and **risk = 0** are justified.\n- The code is purely configuration, with no external inputs or outputs that could be exploited.\n\n### Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all observations are factual.\n- The use of 'stravalib' is benign, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all the above, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
