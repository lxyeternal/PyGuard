  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The import of 'stravalib' is solely for version info, which is a common practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The functions and setup are typical for documentation generation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports 'stravalib' only to retrieve its version, which is safe.\n- sys.path modifications are standard for project documentation.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- No suspicious data flows or external data leaks.\n- The 'skip_member' function only skips special and internal methods, which is normal.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is purely configuration with no security implications.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, serving solely as a documentation configuration.\n- No changes needed to the scores or assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final assessment:**  \nThis code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration script with no malicious or security concerns.",
