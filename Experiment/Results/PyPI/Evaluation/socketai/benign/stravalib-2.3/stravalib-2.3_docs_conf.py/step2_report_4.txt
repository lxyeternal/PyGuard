  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports consistently identify this as a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- The import of 'stravalib' is solely for version retrieval, which is a common practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The functions defined serve typical purposes related to documentation generation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it perform any network or file operations beyond configuration.\n- The sys.path modifications are standard for project documentation.\n- The 'skip_member' function only skips special and internal methods, which is a common pattern.\n- The import of 'stravalib' is used only for obtaining version info, with no further malicious use.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- Security Risk: All reports assign 0, as there are no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- None observed. The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is benign; it’s a typical configuration file.\n- The import of 'stravalib' is justified and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
