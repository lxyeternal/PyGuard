  "purpose": "Configuration for Sphinx documentation builder, setting up paths, extensions, and documentation options.",
  "sources": "Imports 'datetime', 'os', 'sys', and 'stravalib'; modifies sys.path; defines functions for documentation control.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or external data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script. It imports common libraries and 'stravalib' solely to retrieve version info, which is a typical practice. Path modifications are for project documentation. The 'skip_member' function skips special and internal methods, a common pattern. No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code serves purely as documentation setup with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assess its safety. No modifications to scores or assessments are necessary.",
