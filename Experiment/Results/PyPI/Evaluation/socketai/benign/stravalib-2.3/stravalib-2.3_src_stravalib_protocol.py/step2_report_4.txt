  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the overall security risk based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides low-level API interaction with Strava, including OAuth2 token management and request handling. Sources include environment variables, request parameters, and response headers.\n- **Sinks:** Updates to `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `token_expires`, request headers, and response data.\n- **Flows:** Credential retrieval, token exchange/refresh, URL construction, request execution, error handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `print()` in `_token_expired()` for token expiry notification; better to use logging.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard OAuth2 client library with no malicious intent. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The only minor concern is the debug print statement, which is not security-critical.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly elevated due to environment variable handling, but standard practice)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar low-level API client, handling OAuth tokens, with credentials from environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Token exchange, refresh, error raising.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage detected. The code manages tokens securely and performs standard API requests.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1 (standard API client practices)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Handles OAuth, token refresh, API requests, with environment variables for credentials.\n- **Sinks:** Tokens, request headers, API endpoints.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate API client, with no malicious behavior or sabotage.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API interaction, credential management via environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, token refresh.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard API client, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar API client with environment variable credentials.\n- **Sinks:** Requests, URL construction, response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard API client, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a typical API client with token management, OAuth flow, and request handling.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low across all reports, with minor concerns about environment variable handling, which is standard practice.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured client library for interacting with the Strava API. It manages OAuth tokens, performs HTTP requests, and handles errors appropriately. There are no signs of backdoors, malicious code, or sabotage.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with standard API client behavior)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The only minor point is the use of `print()` for token expiry notification, which could be replaced with logging for better practice, but this does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** No further action needed; the code is safe and functions as expected for a supply chain security perspective.",
