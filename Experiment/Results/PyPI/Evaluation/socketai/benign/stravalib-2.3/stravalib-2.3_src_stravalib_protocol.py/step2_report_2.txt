  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and any potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a low-level Strava API client handling OAuth, tokens, and requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately notes token updates, request handling, and logging.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights the use of `print()` in `_token_expired()` instead of logging, which is a minor concern but not a security risk.\n- **Security Considerations:** No malicious intent or backdoors detected. The code manages tokens securely, and error handling is standard.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct, no malicious code detected.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears clear and standard.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2 — reasonable, given the use of environment variables and token handling, but no serious security flaw.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes OAuth token management and request handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or backdoors. Uses environment variables properly.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — accurate.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — aligns with standard API client behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, focusing on OAuth and token management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or backdoors. Proper credential handling.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate and aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — valid.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard API client.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — suitable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; **0** is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports find the code clear and straightforward; **0** is justified.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2) due to the use of environment variables and token management, but nothing indicating a serious security threat.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — standard OAuth client behavior, minimal risk.\n\n**Note:** The only minor concern is the use of `print()` in `_token_expired()`; replacing it with a logging statement would be better for production code but does not constitute a security issue.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion, the code appears secure, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.**",
