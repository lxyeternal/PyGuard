{
  "purpose": "Low-level client for interacting directly with the Strava API, handling OAuth authentication, token management, and HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for client ID and secret; request parameters; response headers and JSON responses.",
  "sinks": "Updates to access_token, refresh_token, token_expires; network requests; logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of credentials from environment variables, OAuth token exchange and refresh, request URL construction, API request execution, error handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print() in _token_expired() instead of logging; minor debugging artifact.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard OAuth2 client with token management, request handling, and error processing. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Environment variables are used appropriately for credentials. The only minor concern is the print statement, which should be replaced with logging for production, but it does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Strava, with no malicious intent or sabotage. It manages tokens securely, handles errors properly, and uses environment variables for sensitive data. The overall security risk is minimal.",
