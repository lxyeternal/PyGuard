{
  "purpose": "Provides low-level HTTP request handling for interacting with the Strava API, including authentication, token management, and request execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('STRAVA_CLIENT_ID', 'STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET'), URL parameters, request headers, and input arguments to methods.",
  "sinks": "Requests made via the 'requests' library, especially token refresh endpoint, API endpoints, and URL construction with formatted strings.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> '_check_credentials' for setting client ID and secret -> '_request' for API calls -> token refresh process if expired -> various request methods (get, post, put, delete) using formatted URLs and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; environment variables are used for credentials, standard HTTP request handling, no hardcoded secrets or credentials in code.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically handles API interactions, including credential management, token refresh, and request execution with error handling. It uses environment variables securely for client credentials, refreshes tokens appropriately, and performs requests with standard practices. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious URL manipulations are evident. The use of environment variables aligns with best practices, and the request logic appears standard for an API client. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical API client for Strava with secure credential handling via environment variables and standard request patterns. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Overall, it appears safe and well-structured.",
