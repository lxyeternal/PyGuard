  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security concerns, and the scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly describes the code as a low-level Strava API client, with sources including environment variables, request parameters, and response headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes token updates, request handling, and logging.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights the use of `print()` in `_token_expired()` instead of logging, which is more of a development oversight than a security issue.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is standard, with no malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The only concern is minor logging practices.\n\n**Security assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to minor logging issue)  \n\n**Verdict:** The code is a legitimate API client with no malicious activity. The minor print statement is not a security threat but should be replaced with logging.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing OAuth token management.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, confirms no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code handles tokens securely and performs standard API interactions.\n\n**Security assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard practices)  \n\n**Verdict:** The code is a typical OAuth client, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on token handling, credential management, and API requests.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Usage of environment variables for credentials is standard.\n\n**Security assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1  \n\n**Verdict:** Legitimate API client, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on credential handling, token refresh, and request execution.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. Uses environment variables appropriately.\n\n**Security assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1  \n\n**Verdict:** Standard, secure API client code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reiterates standard OAuth and API request handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity.\n\n**Security assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1  \n\n**Verdict:** Properly implemented API client, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports show no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) mainly due to minor logging practices, not security threats.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured OAuth2 client library for Strava, handling tokens, API requests, and errors appropriately.\n- No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `print()` instead of logging for token expiry notifications, which is not a security risk but a best practice.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect          | Score  |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Malware         | 0       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0       |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 - 0.2 |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, legitimate, and aligns with best practices for an API client library. No malicious or supply chain threats are evident.",
