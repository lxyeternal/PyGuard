  "purpose": "Low-level HTTP interaction with the Strava API, including authentication, request handling, rate limiting, and error processing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'STRAVA_CLIENT_ID' and 'STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET'; URL parameters; request payloads and headers; response JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Request to 'oauth/token' endpoints; request headers and parameters; response JSON data, especially tokens; error handling raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> _check_credentials() -> self.client_id/self.client_secret; token exchange and refresh -> _request() -> API response; error handling -> exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present in the code. No suspicious network connections, data leaks, or backdoors detected. Use of standard libraries and API endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages OAuth tokens, performs API requests, and handles errors. It retrieves credentials from environment variables, refreshes tokens as needed, and constructs authorized API URLs. No malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The request methods are standard, and no code injection, data exfiltration, or malware indicators are observed. Error handling raises specific exceptions based on HTTP status codes. No obfuscated or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API client implementation with standard security practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles OAuth tokens securely, makes typical HTTP requests, and manages errors properly. No malicious signals or anomalies were identified.",
