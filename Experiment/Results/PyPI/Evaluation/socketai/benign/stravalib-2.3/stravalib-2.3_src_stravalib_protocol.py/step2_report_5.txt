  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: presence of malicious behavior, logical flaws, the appropriateness of scores, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code's OAuth2 handling, token management, request execution, and error handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the use of `print()` in `_token_expired()` instead of logging, which is minor and not security-critical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code functions as a legitimate API client with no malicious intent. The confidence score (0.9) seems reasonable.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, but justified given the handling of tokens and environment variables.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code appears secure and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, emphasizing standard OAuth and request handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard OAuth token management, environment variable use, and request handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The report rightly states it's a legitimate client.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on credential handling and request logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, describes standard API client practices, credential management, and request handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or sabotage detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present; all reports correctly identify the code as straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), justified by the handling of tokens and environment variables, but nothing indicating a serious threat.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured API client for Strava, implementing OAuth2, token refresh, request handling, and error management.\n- No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident.\n- The use of environment variables for credentials is typical and acceptable, provided environment security is maintained.\n- The only minor point is the use of `print()` for token expiry notification, which could be replaced with logging for better practice, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score        | Justification                                                    |\n|--------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**        | **0**        | No malicious activity or backdoors detected.                     |\n| **Obfuscated**     | **0**        | Clear, straightforward code.                                     |\n| **Security Risk**  | **0.1**      | Slightly elevated due to token handling, environment variable reliance, but overall low risk. |\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, standard, and does not pose a supply chain threat.**",
