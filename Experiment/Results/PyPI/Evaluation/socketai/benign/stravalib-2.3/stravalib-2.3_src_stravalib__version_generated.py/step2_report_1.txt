  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a static version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code snippets are minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity.  \n   - They correctly identify that assigning a version string is standard practice and pose no security concerns.  \n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.  \n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - No adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - Since all reports agree that the code is benign, assigning a high risk score would be unjustified.  \n   - The code does not execute any untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle user input.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, exfiltrating data, or obfuscating logic.  \n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - All claims are based on the code's actual content, which is a static assignment.  \n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string.  \n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. No further action or concern is warranted.",
