  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ indicating the software version.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment with no dynamic or external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'v' prefix in version string is slightly uncommon but not suspicious; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input, output, network activity, or dynamic behavior. Multiple reports confirm the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The use of 'v' prefix is a stylistic choice common in versioning, not indicative of malicious intent. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code poses no security risks and is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
