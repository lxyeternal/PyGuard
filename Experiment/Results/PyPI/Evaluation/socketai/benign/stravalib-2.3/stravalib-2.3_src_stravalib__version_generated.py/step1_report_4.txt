  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Single line, straightforward assignment; no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the variable '__version__'. This is a common practice for Python packages to specify their version. There are no suspicious functions, data processing, or external interactions. The simplicity indicates it is unlikely to be malicious or obfuscated. The presence of only a version string does not pose any security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
