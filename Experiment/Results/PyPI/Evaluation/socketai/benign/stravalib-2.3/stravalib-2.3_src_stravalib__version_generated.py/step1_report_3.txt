  "purpose": "Define the version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading operations present).",
  "sinks": "None (no output, data transmission, or external effect).",
  "flows": "No data flows identified as there are no operations besides assigning a string.",
  "anomalies": "The version string includes a non-standard prefix 'v' which is uncommon but not inherently malicious; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a version string to a variable. There are no inputs, outputs, or behaviors indicating malicious intent. No external dependencies or complex logic present. The inclusion of 'v2.3' is typical for versioning, albeit with a prefix that is less common in code but often used in version tags.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define a version identifier. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
