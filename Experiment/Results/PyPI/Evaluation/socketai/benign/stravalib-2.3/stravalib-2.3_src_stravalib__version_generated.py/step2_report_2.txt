  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes. The code simply assigns a static string to `__version__`.  \n- **Errors or Flaws in Logic?** No. The reasoning is sound; this is a standard practice.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Justification for Scores:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior, so the scores are justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes. Same as above, just assigning a static string.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** No. The reasoning is correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes. Again, a static assignment.  \n- **Anomaly Noted?** The use of `'v2.3'` with a `'v'` prefix is slightly less common but not suspicious.  \n- **Errors?** No.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, just a version string.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes. Same pattern.  \n- **Anomalies?** No significant anomalies; the code is minimal.  \n- **Scores:** All zeros are appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue Present?** Yes. Same as above.  \n- **Anomalies?** Slightly uncommon use of `'v'` prefix, but this is a common versioning style and not suspicious.  \n- **Scores:** Zeroes are justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No input, output, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- No malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no external dependencies.\n- The use of `'v'` prefix in version strings is common in version tags, not malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, no security risk detected.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a benign, standard version declaration code snippet with no security concerns.",
