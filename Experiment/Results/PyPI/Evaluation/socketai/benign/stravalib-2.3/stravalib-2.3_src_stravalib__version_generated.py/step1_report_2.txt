  "purpose": "Assigning version string to the module, indicating the software version.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a version string assignment, no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string variable '__version__' with a value 'v2.3'. This is a common practice in Python packages to specify versioning information. There are no input reads, no sinks, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier for the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
