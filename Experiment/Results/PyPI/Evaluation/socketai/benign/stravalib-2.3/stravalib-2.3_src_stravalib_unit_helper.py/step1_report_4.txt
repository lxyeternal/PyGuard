{
  "purpose": "Helper module for converting Strava's units to more practical units, including temperature conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data in the form of numeric values for units and temperature (celsius). It also imports external modules such as 'pint' and 'stravalib.unit_registry'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs converted quantities as 'pint.Quantity' objects and a temperature value in Fahrenheit. No data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input numeric values (floats) are converted into quantities with specified units via the UnitConverter class; temperature input (celsius) is converted to Fahrenheit via the c2f function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of external libraries appears standard for unit handling. No dynamic code execution or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of unit conversion classes and functions, primarily using the 'pint' library to handle physical units. It defines subclasses and helper functions for converting between different units, including a simple Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion function. All operations are straightforward, with no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. External dependencies are legitimate for unit conversions. No suspicious data flows or anomalous code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for unit conversions related to Strava data, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily performs straightforward calculations and unit conversions using established libraries.",
