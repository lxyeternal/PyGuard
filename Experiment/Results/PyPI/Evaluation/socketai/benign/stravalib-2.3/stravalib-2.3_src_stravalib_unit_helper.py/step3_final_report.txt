  "purpose": "Utility module for converting Strava's units to standard units, including a custom _Quantity class and a UnitConverter class for flexible conversions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to conversion functions and class initializations; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network activity, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input numeric values (float, _Quantity, pint.Quantity) flow through UnitConverter.__call__ to produce converted quantities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of float (_Quantity) that attaches a unit string and can produce a pint.Quantity. The UnitConverter class converts various input types into specified units using 'pint'. Predefined instances for common units are provided. The temperature conversion function is simple and standard. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code relies on standard libraries and performs safe, standard conversions without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for unit conversions with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
