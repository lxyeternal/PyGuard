{
  "purpose": "Provide helper functions and classes for unit conversions, primarily for Strava-related data, including temperature conversion.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input sources; it uses only parameters passed to functions and class instances.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data, nor does it execute any system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "The code converts input data (numbers or quantities) into standardized units through class methods and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The unit conversions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of float (_Quantity) for attaching units to numeric values, and a UnitConverter class to perform unit conversions using the pint library. It includes predefined converters for distance, time, speed, and weight units, and a temperature conversion function. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network communications. All code functions are standard and directly related to unit conversion tasks. The code appears to be utility code intended for data processing in a fitness or activity tracking context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for unit conversions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, clear, and functionally appropriate for its purpose.",
