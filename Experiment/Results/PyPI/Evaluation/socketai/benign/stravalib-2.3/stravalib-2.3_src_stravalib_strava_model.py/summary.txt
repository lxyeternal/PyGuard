  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, schema-only set of data models for a fitness tracking API, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is effectively 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate but does not reflect any real vulnerability."
