{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as a placeholder or extension point for SDK customization, allowing users to add handwritten modifications to generated SDK code.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code defines a function with no input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; there is no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the function does not perform any operations.",
  "anomalies": "The function is empty, serving as a stub or extension point, which is normal and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license and copyright notices, which are standard for open-source or corporate codebases. The only function defined, patch_sdk(), is empty and serves as a placeholder for future customizations. No input handling, data processing, or external calls are present. The code structure and comments are typical for SDK extension files. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder meant for future extension and contains no malicious behavior or security issues. It is a standard, well-documented, and safe SDK customization stub.",
