  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a minimal, well-documented stub containing only a single function `patch_sdk()` that does nothing.\n   - It includes extensive licensing comments, which are standard for open-source or corporate SDK code.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or logic within the function.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - The code is straightforward and serves as a placeholder for future manual extensions.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No data flows, sinks, or sources that could lead to security issues.\n   - The code does not perform any operations, data processing, or network activity.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports consistently identify the code as a benign placeholder for SDK customization.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sources, sinks, anomalies, or malicious patterns.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 is correct; the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 is correct; there's no malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: 0 is appropriate; the code poses no security threat.\n   \n   Since the code is a simple placeholder with no operational logic, no modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume the code is a benign placeholder, which is reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are unjustified.\n   - The absence of implementation means there's no attack surface or malicious activity.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is safe, standard, and intended for extension.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n   - No additional risks or malicious behaviors are suggested by the code or reports.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, 0, and 0 respectively.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK extension placeholder with no security concerns.",
