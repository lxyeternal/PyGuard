  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet is a minimal, well-documented placeholder function (`patch_sdk()`) with no implementation.\n- No data inputs, outputs, or processing are present.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n- The code contains only licensing comments and an empty function.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.\n- All reports agree on benignity, with high confidence (1.0).\n- Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n**Confirmations and assessments:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues:**  \n   - The code does *not* contain any actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. It is a simple stub for SDK customization.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious elements.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, which aligns with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   - Since all scores are zero, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code is clearly safe.\n\n5. **Malware score reflection:**  \n   - The malware score is zero, correctly indicating no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they rely on code analysis, which shows no malicious or vulnerable patterns.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a benign, standard placeholder for SDK extension points.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements are present.\n- The high confidence scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a safe, standard SDK placeholder with no security concerns. No further action or concern is warranted.",
