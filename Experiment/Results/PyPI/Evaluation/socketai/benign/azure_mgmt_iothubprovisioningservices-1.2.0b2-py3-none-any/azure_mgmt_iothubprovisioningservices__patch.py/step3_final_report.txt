  "purpose": "Placeholder function for SDK extensions, intended for manual customization.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external calls, or data processing present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; function does nothing.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; function is empty.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, well-documented placeholder with only licensing comments and an empty function. It contains no data sources, sinks, or flows, and shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK extension stub with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
