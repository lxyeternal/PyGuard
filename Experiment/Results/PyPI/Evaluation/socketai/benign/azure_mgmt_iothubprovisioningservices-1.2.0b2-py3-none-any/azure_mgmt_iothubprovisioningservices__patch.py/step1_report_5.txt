{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a stub function intended for manual extensions or patches to SDK-generated code, serving as a placeholder for custom modifications.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources; only static code with comments and an empty function definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function 'patch_sdk' does nothing and has no internal logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious patterns; the code is minimal, well-commented, and standard for SDK customization points.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, empty function with comprehensive licensing comments and instructions for users to extend SDK functionality. No data input, no processing, no execution beyond the placeholder function. No indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation or malware. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for SDK patch points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a placeholder for customization, and contains no malicious or security-related issues. It is safe and does not pose any risks.",
