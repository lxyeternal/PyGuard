  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code consists solely of an empty function definition without any internal logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a minimal stub with extensive license and copyright comments, no executable or malicious content, and no suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple placeholder function intended for extending SDKs, containing only comments and an empty function. No data input, output, or processing occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The comments are standard licensing notices. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
