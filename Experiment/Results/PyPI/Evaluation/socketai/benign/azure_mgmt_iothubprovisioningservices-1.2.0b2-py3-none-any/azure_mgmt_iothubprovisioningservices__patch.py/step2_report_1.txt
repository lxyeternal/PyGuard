  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple, empty placeholder function intended for SDK extensions.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external calls are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The code is well-documented with licensing info.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: a template or stub for future customization.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is minimal and benign. It does not contain any executable logic beyond a function definition that does nothing.\n   - No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as a benign placeholder with no security issues.\n   - They consistently note the absence of data flows, sources, sinks, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5; all are 0.\n   - This is justified because the code is a benign stub with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious activity or intent is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a placeholder.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - The reports uniformly agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\nGiven the code's simplicity and benign nature, I concur with the existing scores.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard SDK extension placeholder.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify this code as safe and non-malicious. No changes to scores are necessary.",
