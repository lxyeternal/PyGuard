{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, specifically for patching or customizing SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in the code; the code defines a function with no input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code does not perform any data processing or output actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as the code contains only a placeholder function with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs or suspicious elements. It appears to be a standard template with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of licensing comments and a single function definition 'patch_sdk' that is currently empty. There are no external data sources, no data processing, and no side effects. The structure and content are typical for SDK extension points, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscated code. The absence of implementation means it does not execute any potentially harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK customization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no source-to-sink data flows, no anomalous code, and performs no actions. It is a standard, safe placeholder.",
