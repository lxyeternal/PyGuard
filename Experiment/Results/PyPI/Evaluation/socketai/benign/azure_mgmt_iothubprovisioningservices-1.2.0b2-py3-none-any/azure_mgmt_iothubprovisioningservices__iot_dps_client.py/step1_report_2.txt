  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for interacting with Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service, including operations for managing certificates and resources.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (deepcopy, typing, azure.core.rest, azure.mgmt.core, and local modules), class initializers, and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "The method _send_request takes an HttpRequest object, copies it, and sends it via the client's send_request method. No untrusted data source is evident within this code.",
  "flows": "HttpRequest object is created externally and passed to _send_request, which then copies and formats it before sending; no external data flow is present within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors identified. The code appears to follow standard SDK design patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard SDK client class with methods for request handling, resource management, and context management. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are apparent. It primarily initializes configuration, prepares requests, and manages network communication using trusted Azure SDK components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of an Azure SDK client for IoT provisioning services. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
