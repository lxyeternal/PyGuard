  "sources": "request.content, request.method, request.url, request.headers, files, template, kwargs",
  "sinks": "HttpRequest constructor, request.set_formdata_body method, str.format method",
  "flows": "request.content -> HttpRequest -> _convert_request; template, kwargs -> str.format -> _format_url_section",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscated logic, standard use of str.format with exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: '_convert_request' converts a request object into an Azure HttpRequest, optionally including form data from files; '_format_url_section' formats URL templates with provided parameters, handling KeyError exceptions by modifying the template. The code relies on standard library functions and Azure SDK modules without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external data is read in an insecure manner, nor is there any data leakage or malicious payload insertion. The code appears to be straightforward utility logic, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. There are no obfuscation techniques, and the functions follow conventional patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions for HTTP request handling and URL formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be standard SDK code with no security risks or malware present.",
