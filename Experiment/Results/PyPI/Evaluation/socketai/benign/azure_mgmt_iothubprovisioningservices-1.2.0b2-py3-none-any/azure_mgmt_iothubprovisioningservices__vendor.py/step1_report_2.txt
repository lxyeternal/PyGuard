  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing HTTP requests and URL formatting in an Azure-related context.",
  "sources": "request.content, request.method, request.url, request.headers, files, template, kwargs",
  "sinks": "HttpRequest constructor, request.set_formdata_body",
  "flows": "request.content or files -> HttpRequest -> set_formdata_body (if files) / URL formatting with template and kwargs",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications. The URL formatting function includes a loop with exception handling but no malicious logic; it appears to be robust. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for HTTP request conversion and URL string formatting. The _convert_request function constructs an HttpRequest object, optionally including form data if files are provided. The _format_url_section function attempts to format a URL template with given keyword arguments, retrying if KeyError occurs, but the logic is straightforward and lacks malicious intent. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or external calls are present. Overall, the code appears to be standard utility code for HTTP request handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module used for constructing HTTP requests and formatting URLs. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this analysis.",
