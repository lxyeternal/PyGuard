  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting HTTP request objects and formatting URL templates, likely used in an SDK or client library for making HTTP calls.",
  "sources": "request.content, request.method, request.url, request.headers, files, template, kwargs",
  "sinks": "HttpRequest constructor, request.set_formdata_body, string.format",
  "flows": "request.content -> HttpRequest; files -> set_formdata_body; template, kwargs -> string.format",
  "anomalies": "None observed. The code performs standard request manipulation and URL formatting without unusual constructs or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: one for converting a request object into an HttpRequest with optional file uploads, and another for formatting URL templates with provided keyword arguments. The logic appears straightforward and uses standard library features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The URL formatting includes exception handling for missing keys but does not contain malicious obfuscation or hidden code. Overall, it appears to be standard, utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and is intended for standard HTTP request handling and URL formatting in an SDK or API client. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
