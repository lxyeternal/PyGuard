  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for HTTP request conversion and URL formatting; no anomalies or malicious behavior observed.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, standard, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious logic. The confidence is high (1), and malware is rated 0.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions; the URL formatting includes a loop with exception handling for missing keys, which is somewhat unusual but not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is robust, and no suspicious external activity or hardcoded secrets are present. The security risk is rated very low (0.1), which seems appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** The report's assessment appears reasonable. No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with an unusual URL formatting approach—removing URL parts with unresolved placeholders.\n- **Assessment:** The complex handling is a defensive measure, not malicious. No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** The low security risk score (0.1) is justified. No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard request and URL formatting functions, no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The code is typical for SDK utility functions, with proper exception handling.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; no modifications necessary.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Helper functions for request conversion and URL formatting, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Clear, conventional code with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with benign utility code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low (0.1) across reports, justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the utility nature and absence of malicious behavior, a risk score of **0.1** remains appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern due to potential misconfiguration or misuse, but not malicious intent.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The complex URL formatting logic in some reports is a defensive approach, not malicious.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The code is standard for SDK utilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.",
