  "sinks": "set_formdata_body (if files provided), string formatting in _format_url_section",
  "flows": "request.content -> HttpRequest object; template + kwargs -> formatted URL string",
  "anomalies": "Unusual loop with exception handling in _format_url_section, which removes URL components with missing keys; no malicious intent but defensive coding",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for HTTP request handling and URL formatting. The _convert_request function conditionally attaches files and constructs an HttpRequest object, which is typical. The _format_url_section function attempts to format a URL template with provided kwargs, with exception handling that removes URL parts if keys are missing, possibly as a defensive measure. No suspicious external calls, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The exception handling in URL formatting is unconventional but not malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the defensive URL handling logic but not indicating malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code used for HTTP request construction and URL formatting. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
