  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing and formatting HTTP requests and URLs, likely used in an SDK or API client.",
  "sources": "Request object content, request attributes (method, url, headers), template strings for URL formatting.",
  "sinks": "HttpRequest construction and modification, string formatting operations.",
  "flows": "Input request data and files -> create or modify HttpRequest object -> format URL template with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard request handling and URL formatting logic without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: '_convert_request' creates an HttpRequest object from an existing request, optionally attaching files; '_format_url_section' attempts to safely format a URL template with given parameters, handling missing keys gracefully. The code employs standard practices for HTTP request manipulation and URL formatting, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code, malicious data flows, or malicious intent are evident. The URL formatting function includes exception handling for missing keys, which is typical for robust URL templating.\n\nOverall, this appears to be legitimate utility code for request handling, with no signs of malicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard request and URL formatting utility functions with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, malicious data flows, or security risks. The functions serve typical purposes within SDK or API client implementations.",
