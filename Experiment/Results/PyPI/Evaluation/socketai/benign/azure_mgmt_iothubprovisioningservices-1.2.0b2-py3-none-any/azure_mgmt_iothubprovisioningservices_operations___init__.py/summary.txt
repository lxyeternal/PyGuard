  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK setup module with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which is a common pattern in generated SDKs but could pose risks if the source module is compromised. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero."
