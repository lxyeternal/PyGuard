  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a standard SDK module with import statements, setting `__all__`, and a call to `_patch_sdk()`.\n   - No data sinks, network calls, or runtime data flows are present.\n   - The only notable anomaly is the use of `from ._patch import *`, which is common in generated SDKs but can obscure imported symbols.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports correctly identify the wildcard import as a style concern but not a security threat.\n   - They consistently note the absence of malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious logic.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident from the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), appropriate for the context.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's nature as auto-generated SDK boilerplate.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5)**:\n   - None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5; they uniformly consider the code safe.\n   - The only concern is the wildcard import, which is a style issue, not a security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the potential risk of wildcard imports but consider it benign in this context.\n   - They correctly note that without access to `_patch.py`, the risk cannot be fully assessed but is unlikely to be malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, low security risk, and no obfuscation.\n   - The overall assessment is that the code is safe and standard for SDK setup.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Clear, generated code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.1 to 0.2** — Minimal security concern mainly due to the wildcard import, which is a common pattern in SDKs.\n\n### **Overall Conclusion**:\nThis code is a typical generated SDK module with no signs of malicious intent. The wildcard import is a style concern but not a security threat. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: **0**\n- **Obfuscated**: **0**\n- **Risk**: **0.1**\n\nThese reflect a safe, standard SDK setup with a minor coding style issue that does not impact security.",
