  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a generated SDK module, primarily performing static imports, setting up `__all__`, and calling a patch function.\n- The only notable anomaly is the use of `from ._patch import *`, which is common in generated SDKs but can obscure imported symbols.\n- No external data handling, network operations, or runtime data flows are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are visible.\n- The reports consistently assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting style concerns rather than actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validity of the Reports\n\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily boilerplate for SDK setup, with no malicious activity.\n- **Wildcard import concern:** Each report notes the use of `from ._patch import *` as a potential style/security concern, which is valid but not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware assessment:** The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate given the code snippet.\n- **Flow & sink analysis:** No data flows or sinks involving untrusted data are present, consistent with the reports.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No claims are made based on assumptions; the reports appropriately recognize the limitations of assessing risk solely from this code.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification & Recommendations\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0; code is clear and generated, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher (around 0.1-0.2) due to the wildcard import concern is reasonable, but it’s a style issue rather than a security flaw.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and cautious.** The main concern is the wildcard import, which could theoretically be exploited if the imported module (`_patch`) is malicious, but in a controlled SDK environment, this is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward, generated boilerplate)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor style concern, not a security threat)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No signs of malicious behavior                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, generated code with no obfuscation                   |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1               | Minor concern over wildcard import, typical in SDKs        |\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious intent. The minimal risk concern relates to coding style, not security. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
