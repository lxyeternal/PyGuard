  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to define a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded string assigned to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only sets a constant value.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard header for a generated or maintained Python package, including licensing and copyright information. The only operational line is the assignment of a version string to a variable, with no dynamic input, external data reading, or other suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code for package versioning.",
