  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a straightforward version string assignment with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — all appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the metadata nature of the code, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly less confident (confidence 0.9), but still correctly notes that this is a benign, auto-generated version declaration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, correctly identifies this as a benign SDK header with no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, minimal code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just a version string assignment with metadata comments.\n- **Malware, obfuscated code, or security risks:** None are detected in any report.\n- **Scores:** All are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly at 0, as the code is benign boilerplate.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nNo changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent with the code snippet provided.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated header with a version string, containing no security concerns.",
