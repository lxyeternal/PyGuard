{
  "purpose": "This code defines a version string for a Python package, accompanied by license comments. It serves as metadata for the package versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only a simple assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, auto-generated boilerplate with license comments and a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, auto-generated header containing license information and a version string assignment. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or data processing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and standard. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign boilerplate for versioning with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
