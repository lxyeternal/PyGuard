  "purpose": "Serialization and deserialization of data formats including JSON, XML, date/time, enums, and binary data, primarily for SDK data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads data from streams, bytes, headers, and object attributes; accesses internal attribute maps and model metadata.",
  "sinks": "Processes data into XML nodes, JSON-compatible dicts, or primitive types; no external commands or network calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (streams, headers, objects) through eval-based type conversions into target formats or models.",
  "anomalies": "Uses eval() in serialize_basic and deserialize_basic functions for converting type names and string data into Python types.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive utility for serializing and deserializing various data formats. The primary security concern is the use of eval() for converting string type names to Python types and vice versa. While eval() is limited to known, controlled type names such as 'str', 'int', 'float', 'bool', and enums, if untrusted data or type strings are processed, this could lead to code execution vulnerabilities. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The eval() usage is a common pattern in such libraries but should be replaced with safer alternatives like a predefined mapping to eliminate potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate SDK utility for data serialization/deserialization. The main security risk stems from eval(), which, if misused with untrusted input, could be exploited. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4) due to eval(). It is recommended to refactor eval() calls to safer constructs to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.",
