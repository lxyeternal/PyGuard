  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate SDK utility for data serialization/deserialization. The main security risk stems from eval(), which, if misused with untrusted input, could be exploited. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4) due to eval(). It is recommended to refactor eval() calls to safer constructs to mitigate potential vulnerabilities."
