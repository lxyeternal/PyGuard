  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Structure:**\n   - The code is a straightforward SDK customization template.\n   - It includes licensing comments, a module docstring with a URL for guidance, an import statement (`from typing import List`), a module-level `__all__` list, and a single function `patch_sdk()` with a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is static, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No external data handling, network operations, or code execution.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is a placeholder for user customizations, a common pattern in SDK templates.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations:**\n   - The reports seem to over-justify the benign nature, but given the code's simplicity, this is reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states that the code is a standard template.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe SDK customization scaffold with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard SDK customization template with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed; the current scores and reasoning are justified.",
