{
  "purpose": "SDK customization template allowing user-defined modifications to the generated SDK code.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; static code with comments, import statements, and a placeholder function.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external calls, or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is static and non-executing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, boilerplate SDK customization scaffold with licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty __all__ list, and a placeholder function 'patch_sdk()' with descriptive docstring. It contains no data inputs, outputs, external communication, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and intended for user customization, typical in SDK templates.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for SDK customization, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
