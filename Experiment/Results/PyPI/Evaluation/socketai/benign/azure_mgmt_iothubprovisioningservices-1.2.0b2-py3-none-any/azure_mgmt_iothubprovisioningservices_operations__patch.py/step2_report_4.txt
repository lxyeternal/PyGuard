  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the provided code.\n\n**1. Presence of malicious code or suspicious behavior:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK customization template.\n- The code contains only import statements, an empty `__all__` list, licensing comments, a module docstring, and a `patch_sdk` function with a descriptive docstring.\n- No input/output handling, data processing, network operations, or external data sources are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or errors in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, boilerplate, and intended for user customization.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n**3. Scoring assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- No justification is needed; the code is clearly safe.\n\n**5. Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as a harmless template.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made or justified.\n\n**6. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard SDK customization scaffold with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.",
