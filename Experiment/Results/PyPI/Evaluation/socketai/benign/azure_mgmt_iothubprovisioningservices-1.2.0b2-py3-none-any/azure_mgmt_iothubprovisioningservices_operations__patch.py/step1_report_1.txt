  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing SDK-generated code, allowing users to modify or extend default SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only imports and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code contains only function declarations and comments.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard SDK customization template with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports List from typing, defines an empty __all__ list for exports, and provides a 'patch_sdk' function intended for user customizations. It includes no external input, no execution of untrusted code, and no malicious behavior. The comments reference external links for guidance and caution about the purpose of 'patch_sdk'. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The code appears to be a safe, standard SDK customization scaffold.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign template for SDK customization with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
