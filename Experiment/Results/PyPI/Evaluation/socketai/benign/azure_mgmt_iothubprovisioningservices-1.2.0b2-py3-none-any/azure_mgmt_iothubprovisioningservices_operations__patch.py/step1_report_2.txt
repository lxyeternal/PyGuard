{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated code, likely for a Python SDK related to Azure services, and includes licensing and copyright information.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'List' class from 'typing' and the module-level variables, as well as the 'patch_sdk' function which contains a docstring.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in the code where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "The code primarily consists of definitions and documentation; no data flows or input/output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal template with licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, a module-level list '__all__', and a single function 'patch_sdk' with a descriptive docstring. There are no code execution, input handling, or external data processing mechanisms. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, serving as a placeholder for custom SDK modifications. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template meant for customization purposes in SDK development. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and poses no security risks. It is standard in structure and comments, with no hidden or harmful logic.",
