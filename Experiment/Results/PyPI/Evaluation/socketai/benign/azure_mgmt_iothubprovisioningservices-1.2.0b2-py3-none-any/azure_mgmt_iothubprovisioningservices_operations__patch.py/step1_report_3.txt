{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code for a Microsoft Azure SDK package, allowing users to add their custom modifications via the `patch_sdk` function.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points that process untrusted data or output data; the code does not handle user input or external data streams.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows since no input or output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual constructs. It includes a placeholder function intended for custom modifications, which is common in SDK customization templates.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple template for SDK customization, with licensing comments, a module docstring, an import statement, and an empty `patch_sdk` function. It does not process or execute untrusted data, nor does it include any malicious or obfuscated code. The presence of a placeholder function is typical for SDKs allowing user customizations. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK customization template with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard for its purpose.",
