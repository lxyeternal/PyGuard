  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK customization template.\n   - The code contains only import statements, a list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external data handling, or execution of untrusted code.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard boilerplate for SDK customization.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely boilerplate with no active logic, no external data handling, and no malicious intent.\n   - Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's content.\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard SDK template.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis, reflecting a safe, benign template.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk present.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign SDK customization scaffold with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates, they would match the current scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
