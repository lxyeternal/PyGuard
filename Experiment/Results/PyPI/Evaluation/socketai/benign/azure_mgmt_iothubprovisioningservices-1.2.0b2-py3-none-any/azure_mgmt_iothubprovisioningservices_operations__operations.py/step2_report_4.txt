  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard SDK function for listing operations.\n- Sources/Sinks: Typical request construction, response deserialization.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Legitimate SDK pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar SDK listing function.\n- Sources/Sinks: Standard request/response flow.\n- Anomalies: No secrets or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical SDK pattern, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate SDK code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: SDK for listing API operations.\n- Sources/Sinks: Standard request building, deserialization.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code or secrets.\n- Analysis: Typical SDK, no signs of malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard SDK code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: SDK for listing resources.\n- Sources/Sinks: Standard request/response flow.\n- Anomalies: No secrets or obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Typical SDK pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: SDK for listing operations.\n- Sources/Sinks: Request construction, URL parsing.\n- Anomalies: No secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Standard API client code, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, low risk.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors. The consistent zero scores are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; all reports confirm clear, standard SDK code.\n- **Risk Score:** The reported risk is uniformly low (0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature as an SDK client.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical Azure SDK implementation for listing operations with pagination support.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- URL handling and request construction follow standard patterns, with no suspicious or malicious manipulation.\n- The use of external libraries and URL parsing is standard and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with the reports, representing minimal inherent risk in SDK code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are thorough and accurate. The code is legitimate, safe, and does not pose security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code as a standard SDK client implementation.",
