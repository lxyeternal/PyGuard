  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard SDK implementation for listing operations with low security risk. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering potential misuse of untrusted URL inputs in pagination, but this is typical in SDKs and not indicative of malicious intent."
