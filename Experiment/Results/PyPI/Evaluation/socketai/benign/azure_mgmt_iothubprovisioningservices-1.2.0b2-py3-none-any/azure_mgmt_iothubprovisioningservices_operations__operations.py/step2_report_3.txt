  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard SDK request building, pagination, and response handling. No suspicious sources.\n- **Sinks:** Response deserialization, request URLs, headers, next links—standard for SDKs.\n- **Flows:** Typical request-response flow with pagination.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical, legitimate SDK implementation for listing operations. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard SDK code, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—standard SDK request construction and response processing.\n- **Sinks:** Uses deserialization, URL formatting, request building—normal.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code for listing operations, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SDK pattern for listing API operations.\n- **Sinks:** Response deserialization, request construction.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK code with no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for listing Azure IoT operations, standard request and response flow.\n- **Sinks:** Request creation, URL handling, deserialization.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK pattern, with focus on request construction and pagination.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP requests, URL parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK code, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Uniformly 0.2, indicating low security risk, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate; typical SDK code with minimal security considerations)\n\n**Note:** No adjustments needed. The reports are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard SDK implementation for listing API operations with proper error handling, pagination, and request construction. No malicious or obfuscated activity is present. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code's content.",
