  "purpose": "Configuration class for Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service SDK, setting up policies and credentials.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: credential, subscription_id, optional kwargs (api_version, credential_scopes, policies).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; policies and credentials are used internally for SDK setup without external data leaks.",
  "flows": "Credential and parameters flow into policy instantiations and attribute assignments; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, sets default policies, and constructs an authentication policy using provided credentials. It follows standard SDK patterns, with no network activity or malicious logic. The policies are instantiated with safe defaults or provided configurations. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard SDK configuration class for Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is safe and aligns with typical SDK practices.",
