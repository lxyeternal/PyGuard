  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated SDK initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The observed patterns are typical for SDK boilerplate code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to the wildcard import pattern which is standard but warrants cautious review in strict security environments."
