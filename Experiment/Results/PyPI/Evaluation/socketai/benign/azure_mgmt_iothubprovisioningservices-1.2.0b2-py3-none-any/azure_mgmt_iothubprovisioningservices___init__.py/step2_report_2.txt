  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It sets up an SDK module with imports, version info, optional patching, and safe exception handling.\n- No external data, network calls, credentials, or obfuscated/malicious code are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for an Azure SDK.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes SDK setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard try-except.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) noted; common in SDKs but potentially risky if misused.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The wildcard import and patching are typical but could obscure malicious modifications. However, no evidence of malicious intent is present.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Discussion:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 is somewhat high given the lack of evidence. Wildcard imports can sometimes be exploited, but in SDK boilerplate, they are standard. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0.1 or 0, reflecting that this pattern is common and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import and patch invocation are noted but are standard in SDKs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Wildcard import and dynamic extension of `__all__` are common but could be scrutinized.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard boilerplate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Discussion:** The slightly elevated securityRisk score (0.1) is acceptable, considering the wildcard import and dynamic `__all__` extension. These are typical SDK patterns but should be noted.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Similar patterns; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, correct.\n- **Risk Scores:** Most are 0 or very low (0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, standard SDK boilerplate with common patterns like wildcard imports and optional patching)\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The only point of contention is the securityRisk scores of 0.1 or 0.2 due to wildcard imports. These are common in SDKs but can be misused; however, given the context, they are not malicious.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable. I recommend maintaining the malware score at 0 and keeping the risk scores low, around 0.05–0.1, to reflect the standard SDK pattern without implying any malicious intent.",
