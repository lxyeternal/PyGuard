  "purpose": "SDK initialization and patch management for Azure IoT DPS client library.",
  "sources": "Module import statements, version import, optional patch import with try-except, dynamic extension of __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no network communication, no external data handling.",
  "flows": "Importing modules, setting version, applying patches, extending __all__ list.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from ._patch, dynamic modification of __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated SDK setup script. It imports core modules, manages versioning, conditionally imports optional patches, and extends the __all__ list dynamically. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation. The wildcard import and dynamic __all__ extension are common in SDK boilerplate but could be scrutinized in security-sensitive contexts. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated SDK initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The observed patterns are typical for SDK boilerplate code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), primarily due to the wildcard import pattern which is standard but warrants cautious review in strict security environments.",
