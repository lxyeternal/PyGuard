  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard SDK setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar SDK initialization, with mention of wildcard import and patching.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score of 0.2 seems somewhat high given the benign nature, but it could reflect the potential concern over wildcard import and dynamic patching. Still, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard SDK setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar SDK initialization, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to the wildcard import and dynamic extension of `__all__`, but still consistent with benign SDK boilerplate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard SDK setup, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is standard SDK boilerplate without malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low risk (0 or 0.1). Given the code's nature—standard module setup with no external data handling, no credentials, no network activity—the risk scores seem appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0**, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased to **0.1** or **0.2** due to the use of wildcard imports and dynamic patching, which could potentially hide malicious modifications, but in this context, they are standard SDK practices.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the wildcard import and patching pattern, but still very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK setup module with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores in the reports are reasonable, with minor adjustments to risk scores for cautiousness.",
