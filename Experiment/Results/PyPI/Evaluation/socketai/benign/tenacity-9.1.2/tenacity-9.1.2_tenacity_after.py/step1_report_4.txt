{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling retry call strategies, including doing nothing or logging retry attempts, as part of a larger retry mechanism in the 'tenacity' library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, logging) and 'tenacity._utils' for internal utilities.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions where untrusted data (e.g., callback names, timing info) are formatted and sent to a logger.",
  "flows": "The 'after_log' function creates a closure 'log_it' which receives a RetryCallState object, extracts the callback function name and timing info, then logs this data, potentially involving untrusted or dynamic content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of internal utilities and standard logging appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines retry handling strategies for a retry library. 'after_nothing' performs no action, while 'after_log' logs information about each retry attempt, including function name and elapsed time. The function 'log_it' accesses retry state data, formats log messages, and uses the provided logger. All operations involve standard library functions and expected behaviors without obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code does not contain data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility component of a retry library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard logging and does not handle sensitive data insecurely.",
