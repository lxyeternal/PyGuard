  "purpose": "Utility functions for retry handling and logging, designed to log retry attempts or do nothing.",
  "sources": "retry_state parameters, imported utilities (_utils), logger object",
  "sinks": "logger.log outputs, potentially to external logging systems",
  "flows": "retry_state.fn or attributes to logger.log messages",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward use of logging and utility functions",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple retry handling strategies, including a no-op and a logging callback. It uses standard imports and internal utilities for callback name retrieval and ordinal conversion. No untrusted data processing, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logging functions are standard and do not handle sensitive data directly. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for retry handling and logging, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified by the potential for logging to leak sensitive info if misconfigured, but this is a general concern rather than a code flaw. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward.",
