{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for retrying operations, including logging after attempts.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tenacity' library and uses a type-checking import from 'typing'.",
  "sinks": "Uses logger.log to output messages; logger is a parameter passed into functions.",
  "flows": "Input data: retry_state object passed into log_it; output: log message to logger.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines retry handling strategies, including a no-op and a logging function. It imports 'tenacity' utilities, which are common for retry logic. The 'after_log' function logs details about the retry attempt, including the function name and elapsed time, using parameters provided at call time. No external data is read or written outside the logging operation. The code appears to be standard utility code for logging retry attempts, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility for logging retry attempts within a larger retry mechanism. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flow, and no signs of sabotage. It is safe and normal in purpose.",
