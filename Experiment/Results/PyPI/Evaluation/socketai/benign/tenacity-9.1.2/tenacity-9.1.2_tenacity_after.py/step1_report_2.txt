{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for retry mechanisms, including logging retry attempts and success, within a Python package, likely related to the 'tenacity' library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tenacity' and standard library modules, reading from the 'logging' module, and functions that access 'retry_state' attributes.",
  "sinks": "Logging output, which could be directed to various handlers; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'retry_state' is passed into 'after_log' callback, which uses its attributes to generate log messages; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard library and third-party modules as intended, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple utility functions for logging retry attempts, relying on the 'tenacity' package's internal utilities and standard logging. The functions perform standard logging of retry attempts without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation beyond logging messages. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be straightforward and typical for a retry logging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging utility for retry mechanisms, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply logs retry attempts with no external data leaks or harmful actions.",
