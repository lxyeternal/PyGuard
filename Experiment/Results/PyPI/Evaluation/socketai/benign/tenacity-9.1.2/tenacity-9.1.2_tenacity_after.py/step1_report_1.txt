{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for retrying function calls with optional logging behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as 'retry_state', 'logger', and 'log_level'. It also uses imported modules '_utils' and 'typing'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to external systems or perform actions that could lead to data leakage or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Input 'retry_state' is used within 'log_it' to extract function name and timing information; the logger is used to output log messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code primarily handles logging with no data exfiltration or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions related to retry mechanisms, notably 'after_nothing' and 'after_log'. 'after_log' creates a logging callback that records the completion of a function call with timing details. It utilizes imported utilities to retrieve callback names and convert attempt numbers to ordinal forms. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. It does not interact with external resources beyond standard logging, nor does it process untrusted data in a way that could cause harm. The import '_utils' is an internal utility module, presumed safe in context. Overall, the code performs standard logging and retry logic without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility for handling retry logging behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks. The code appears to be well-structured, purposeful, and safe.",
