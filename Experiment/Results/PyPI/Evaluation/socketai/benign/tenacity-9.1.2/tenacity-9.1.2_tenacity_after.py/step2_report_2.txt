  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the provided summaries.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, defining utility functions for retry logic, primarily logging.\n- It imports from 'tenacity' and 'tenacity._utils', which are standard for retry mechanisms.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data manipulation beyond logging.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The functions perform benign logging and no-op actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign utility functions, no anomalies, malware, or security risks.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; the code is a simple logging utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard retry logging utility, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the code logs retry attempts with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 are appropriate.\n- **Note:** The report assigns a security risk of 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for retry logging, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; the code logs retry info without handling untrusted data insecurely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are acceptable.\n- **Note:** The report notes potential leakage if logger is misconfigured, but that’s outside the code's control and not a security flaw per se.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Retry strategies, including logging, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; the code logs function name and timing info, which are not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 or 0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Note:** The report assigns risk=0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard retry logging utility, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n- **Note:** The confidence scores are slightly below 1, which is fine given the straightforward code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low risk (0.0 or 0.1). Given the benign nature, these are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is benign; no changes needed in scores.\n- The low risk scores are justified, given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable for minimal risk due to logging operations)\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, safe utility component with no security concerns.",
