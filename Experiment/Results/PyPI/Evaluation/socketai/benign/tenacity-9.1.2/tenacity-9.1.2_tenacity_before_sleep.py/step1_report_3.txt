{
  "purpose": "The code defines retry strategies for a Python library, including logging and doing nothing before sleep.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, but accesses attributes of the 'retry_state' object to determine the retry outcome, next action, and function details.",
  "sinks": "The code logs messages using a provided logger, which could potentially be used to leak sensitive info if misused, but no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The flow is from inspecting the 'retry_state' object (source) to calling 'logger.log' with a formatted message (sink), contingent on the outcome and next_action properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The functions perform standard logging operations based on retry state.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one that does nothing before sleep, and another that logs retry attempts, including exception info if configured. It checks the outcome and next action of a retry, then logs the appropriate message. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. The logger usage is straightforward and controlled; no data leakage or external communication occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of retry logging strategies, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It uses standard Python features and external library utilities appropriately.",
