  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility module for retry strategies with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The code is straightforward, involving logging and no external or malicious calls.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the confidence is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard retry logging with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n- Slightly less than perfect confidence, but justified given the straightforward nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate assessment. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard, with potential minor security concern due to logging.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The only concern is the potential for logging sensitive info, which could be misused.\n- However, the code itself does not leak secrets or perform malicious actions.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting a minor concern about logging practices rather than an actual vulnerability.\n\n**Conclusion:** The score seems appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard retry and logging logic, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard retry logging with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) due to potential log exposure, but still within a safe margin.\n- The reasoning is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** Justified and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code; malware=0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk Scores:** The minor securityRisk scores (0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the potential for log information exposure but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly related to logging practices, not actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**In conclusion, the reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign utility module for retry logic, with no malicious intent or security issues.**",
