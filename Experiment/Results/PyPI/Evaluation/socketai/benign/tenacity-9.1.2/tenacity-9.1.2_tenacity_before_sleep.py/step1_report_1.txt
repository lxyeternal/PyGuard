{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for retrying operations, including logging retry attempts and doing nothing before sleep.",
  "sources": "The code reads import modules (typing, tenacity), and accesses attributes of 'retry_state' such as outcome, next_action, and fn.",
  "sinks": "The code logs retry attempts via a logger, which could potentially leak information if logging is misused. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "From reading 'retry_state' attributes to logging output that describes retry behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is standard for retry logic with logging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of retry strategies, including a no-op and a logging function. It accesses retry state attributes, checks for failures, and logs retry attempts with relevant info. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code segments are present. The functions rely on standard logging practices and do not perform any external calls or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a utility module for retry handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for retry strategies with logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It is a standard, well-structured code snippet.",
