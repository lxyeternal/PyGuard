  "purpose": "Utility functions for retry handling and logging retry attempts within the 'tenacity' library framework.",
  "sources": "Attributes of the 'retry_state' object such as 'outcome', 'next_action', and 'fn' which are set during retry attempts.",
  "sinks": "Logging calls that output retry information; no external data sinks or transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "From 'retry_state.outcome' and 'retry_state.next_action' to the logging output, with decision branches based on success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with proper checks and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard retry logging functions, checking for outcome and next_action attributes, raising errors if unset, and logging retry attempts with details. No external calls, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The logic is correct and typical for such utilities. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code's benign nature is consistent with its purpose, and no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for retry attempt logging, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor security risk scores could be lowered to zero for accuracy, but they are acceptable as is.",
