{
  "purpose": "This code provides logging and retry mechanisms for a retry library, specifically defining strategies for actions before sleeping between retries.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'retry_state' object (imported from tenacity) to determine outcome, next_action, and function name; also reads from the logger object provided as an argument.",
  "sinks": "The logger.log function outputs retry information, potentially exposing internal state in logs. No other data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Sources (retry_state attributes) are used within log_it to generate log messages, which are then output via logger.log.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; the code performs standard logging and retry handling functions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'before_sleep_nothing' (a no-op) and 'before_sleep_log' (which creates a logging function). The 'before_sleep_log' function captures a logger, log level, and exception info flag, returning a nested function that logs retry attempts with detailed outcome info. The nested function retrieves outcome and next_action from the retry_state, raises errors if these are unset, and logs retry attempts with appropriate context. The code uses safe practices, relying on passed-in objects and avoiding unsafe operations. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. All operations are standard for a retry logging mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard retry logging functionality without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for logging retry attempts.",
