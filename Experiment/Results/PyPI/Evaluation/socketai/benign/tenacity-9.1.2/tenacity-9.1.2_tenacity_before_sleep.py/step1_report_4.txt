{
  "purpose": "The code provides logging and retry mechanisms for handling retry attempts with customizable strategies, primarily used in conjunction with the 'tenacity' library.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'retry_state' parameter passed to callback functions, which contains outcome, next_action, and function information; imports 'logging' and 'tenacity._utils'.",
  "sinks": "Logging output via the provided logger; potential exposure of exception details if 'exc_info' is enabled.",
  "flows": "Retry call state is checked for outcome and next_action; depending on success or failure, logs are generated with relevant details; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard retry and logging logic; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or hidden behaviors; no obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two retry strategies: one that does nothing ('before_sleep_nothing') and one that logs retry attempts ('before_sleep_log'). It validates the state of 'retry_state' before logging and provides detailed log messages based on success or failure outcomes. All operations are standard, with proper error handling and no external or malicious behavior detected. The use of 'tenacity' library and logging is typical and does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious data handling or hidden malicious code identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements standard retry and logging strategies with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for robust retry handling.",
