      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for retry handling and logging, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified by the potential for logging to leak sensitive info if misconfigured, but this is a general concern rather than a code flaw. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward."

The existing malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate, though the risk score could be further lowered to 0 given the benign nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
