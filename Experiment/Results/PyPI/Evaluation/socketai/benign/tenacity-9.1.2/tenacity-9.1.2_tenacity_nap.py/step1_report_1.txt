  "purpose": "Provides sleep strategies using time.sleep and threading.Event for delaying execution.",
  "sources": "Reading from time module for sleep, accessing threading.Event in sleep_using_event constructor.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Code calls time.sleep or event.wait, but these are standard sleep functions without data flow or untrusted input impact.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code only defines sleep strategies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two sleep functions: one using the standard time.sleep and another using threading.Event.wait, both of which are common and safe. The event object is passed in during class instantiation, with no hardcoded credentials or external data fetching. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and includes licensing comments. No unusual code patterns or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard sleep operations for delaying execution, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
