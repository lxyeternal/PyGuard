{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for sleeping and waiting on threading events, likely for synchronization or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'seconds' in sleep(), 'event' in sleep_using_event.__init__, 'timeout' in sleep_using_event.__call__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no data leaks or external effects present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into standard library functions (time.sleep and event.wait), which are safe and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two sleep strategies: a simple wrapper around time.sleep() and a class that waits on a threading.Event. Both are standard, well-documented, and do not perform any malicious actions. No external data, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The code is typical for synchronization or testing utilities. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for sleep and synchronization, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and the scores justified.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
