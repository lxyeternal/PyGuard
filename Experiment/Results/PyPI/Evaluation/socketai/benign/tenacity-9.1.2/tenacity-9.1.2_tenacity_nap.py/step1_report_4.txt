{
  "purpose": "Provides sleep strategies for delaying execution, either by time or event wait, primarily for use in testing or asynchronous control flow.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'time' and 'typing'; reads the 'event' attribute during instantiation and invocation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or security effects; no untrusted data processing or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only manipulates internal objects and system sleep functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and includes typical docstrings and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two sleep strategies: a simple time.sleep delay and an event-based wait, suitable for synchronization or testing. Both utilize standard, safe Python library functions without any obfuscated or malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing standard sleep mechanisms with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
