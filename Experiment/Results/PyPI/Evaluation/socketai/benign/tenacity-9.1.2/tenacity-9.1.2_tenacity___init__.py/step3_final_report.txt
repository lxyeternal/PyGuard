  "purpose": "A comprehensive retry utility library supporting multiple strategies, callbacks, and integrations for robust retry mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Function inputs, callback functions, environment variables, internal state management",
  "sinks": "Execution of user-supplied callback functions, potential for malicious code execution if callbacks are untrusted",
  "flows": "Source inputs (callbacks, function args) flow into retry logic, which executes callbacks and manages retries and delays",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, optional modules handled gracefully",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, open-source retry framework with extensive support for strategies, callbacks, and integrations. It executes user-defined functions and callbacks, which could be exploited if malicious. No embedded malicious logic, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The risk primarily stems from executing untrusted callbacks, which is inherent to such frameworks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the potential misuse of callbacks but no actual malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe retry utility with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is the execution of user-defined callbacks, which should be used cautiously with untrusted code. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.",
