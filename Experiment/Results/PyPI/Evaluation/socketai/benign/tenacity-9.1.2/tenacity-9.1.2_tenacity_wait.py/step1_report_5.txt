{
  "purpose": "This code defines various wait strategies for retry mechanisms, likely used to control delay times between retry attempts in network or system operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (abc, random, typing), and internal modules (_utils from tenacity). No input sources such as network, file, or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not include data sinks that send data externally or store sensitive information.",
  "flows": "The functions mainly compute wait times based on internal parameters or retry state. The retry state is passed to each wait strategy, but no data is transmitted externally or used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses the 'random' module for generating wait durations, which is standard for jitter. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward and consistent with retry logic. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple wait strategies for retries, including fixed, random, incremental, exponential, and combined approaches. All functions utilize standard modules and predictable calculations. The 'random' module is used solely for jitter and variability in wait times, which is a common pattern. There are no signs of malicious data leakage, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code does not include any network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It appears to be a benign utility for controlling retry delays.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of wait strategies for retries, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It employs common patterns for jitter and backoff. There are no suspicious behaviors or malicious modifications detected.",
