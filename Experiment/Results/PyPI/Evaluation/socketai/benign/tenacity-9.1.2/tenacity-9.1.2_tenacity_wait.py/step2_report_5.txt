  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines wait strategies for retries, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Uses 'random' only for jitter, which is standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The use of 'random' is appropriate for jitter. The high confidence aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms the code is a standard utility for retry delays, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No suspicious code or behavior. The use of 'random' for jitter is typical.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code is a straightforward implementation of wait strategies with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, confirms standard retry delay strategies, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The use of 'random' is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) possibly due to conservative stance.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 is slightly higher than previous reports but still low. Given the code's benign nature, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; thus, malware=0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is justified.\n\n- **Security risk:** The code is a utility module with no external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications. The slight variation in report 5 (0.1) is acceptable, perhaps reflecting cautiousness.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with the code's content.\n\n- No changes are necessary; the reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Estimated scores based on the entire analysis:**\n\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n  \n  - **Risk:** 0.0–0.1 (very low, due to the utility nature of the code)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign implementation of retry wait strategies, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided scores are justified and consistent with the code content.",
