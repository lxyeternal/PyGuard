  "purpose": "This code provides various retry wait strategies for controlling delays between retry attempts in Python, mainly for use with the 'tenacity' library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'abc', 'random', 'typing', and 'tenacity._utils'. No input reading functions or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or sensitive information. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "The code defines classes that implement wait strategies which receive 'RetryCallState' objects and produce float wait times. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the flow is confined within wait strategy methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors. Use of 'random' for wait durations is normal in jitter strategies, with no indication of malicious intent. The code appears standard for implementing retry delay strategies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes for implementing wait strategies in retries, including fixed, random, incremental, exponential, and combined strategies. These classes utilize 'random' for jitter and 'tenacity' utilities for time conversions. No inputs are read from external sources, and no data is sent or stored suspiciously. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated language features or hidden code. Usage of 'random' is appropriate for jitter calculations. No hardcoded secrets or credential leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of wait strategies for retry logic, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for managing retry delays. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
