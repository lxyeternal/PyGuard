{
  "purpose": "Define various wait strategies for retry mechanisms, including fixed, random, incremental, exponential backoff, and their combinations, used in retry logic frameworks.",
  "sources": "Imports random module, uses functions from tenacity._utils, and reads 'retry_state' input in multiple __call__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data is written to external systems, network, or files; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Random values generated in wait_random, wait_random_exponential, and wait_exponential_jitter flow from source to return statement without external influence; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random module for jitter and wait calculations is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors identified; no unusual code behavior or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured classes implementing various retry wait strategies. It imports standard modules, uses a third-party library (tenacity) utilities, and employs 'random' for jitter. No malicious patterns, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation, are evident. The random usage appears solely for backoff jitter, a common pattern. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs. The code aligns with typical retry strategy implementations and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of wait strategies for retry mechanisms, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any network communication, data leaks, or backdoors. The use of 'random' is appropriate for jitter calculations, and no suspicious anomalies are present.",
