  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of retry wait strategies with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate, though the risk score could be further lowered to 0 given the benign nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
