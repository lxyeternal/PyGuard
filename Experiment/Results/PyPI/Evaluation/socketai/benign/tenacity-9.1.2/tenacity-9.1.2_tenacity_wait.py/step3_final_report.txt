{
  "purpose": "Defines various wait strategies for retry mechanisms, including fixed, random, incremental, exponential, jitter, and chain strategies, used to control delay between retries in resilient systems.",
  "sources": "Imports 'random' module for jitter, and '_utils' for time conversions; no external data or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems; code solely computes wait durations internally.",
  "flows": "Input: retry_state.attempt_number; Output: computed wait time based on strategy functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements retry wait strategies with clear, standard patterns. Uses 'random' for jitter, which is common. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation present. No suspicious or malicious code patterns. The logic is simple and intended for retry delay calculations. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The use of 'random' is appropriate for jitter, not malicious. The code is not obfuscated and adheres to best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of retry wait strategies with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate, though the risk score could be further lowered to 0 given the benign nature. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
