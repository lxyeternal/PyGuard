  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The report correctly identifies the code as a set of wait strategies for retries, with no malicious behavior. The code matches the original code provided.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The report's reasoning is sound; it notes the use of 'random' for jitter, which is standard. No logical flaws or misinterpretations.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — justified.  \n  The high confidence (0.95) aligns with the thorough analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The analysis correctly states that the code is standard for retry strategies, with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent, and the code matches the original.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — justified.  \n  Confidence is perfect (1).\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The review finds no malicious behavior, just retry delay logic.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  No. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — justified.  \n  Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The analysis states the code is standard for retry strategies with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — justified.  \n  Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The report correctly notes the use of 'random' for jitter, standard in such utilities, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors?**  \n  No. The analysis is accurate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — slightly higher, but still low, perhaps reflecting minimal concern over the use of 'random'.  \n  Given the code's nature, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code contains no malicious patterns, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to 0. This is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Security risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard implementation of retry wait strategies, using common modules and patterns. The use of 'random' for jitter is typical and safe. No external data, network, or sensitive information handling is present. The code does not exhibit obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe existing scores are accurate and justified. No adjustments needed.",
