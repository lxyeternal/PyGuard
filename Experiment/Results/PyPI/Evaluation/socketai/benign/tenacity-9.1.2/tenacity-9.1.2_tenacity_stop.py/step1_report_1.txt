{
  "purpose": "Defines various stop strategies for retry logic, including conditions based on attempt count, elapsed time, and events.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (abc, typing), third-party 'tenacity' module, and threading events.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines classes and methods for control flow within retry logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. Usage of 'tenacity' is standard for retry mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract base class for stop conditions, with multiple subclasses implementing specific stopping criteria. It employs standard Python modules and 'tenacity' utilities without manipulating untrusted data or performing network operations. No signs of malicious intent or backdoors are present. The functions and classes are typical for retry control and do not exhibit suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be legitimate, intended for implementing retry stop strategies in a Python application. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is well-structured and uses standard patterns for retry logic.",
