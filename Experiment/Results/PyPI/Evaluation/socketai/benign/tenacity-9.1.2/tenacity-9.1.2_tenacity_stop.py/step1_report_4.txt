{
  "purpose": "Define various stop strategies for retry mechanisms, including conditions based on attempt count, elapsed time, events, and logical combinations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tenacity' library, standard Python modules 'abc' and 'typing', and threading events.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Code mainly defines classes and methods for control flow based on internal states; no external data flows or untrusted input handling identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Use of underscore-prefixed internal modules ('_utils') from 'tenacity' is standard for internal utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a hierarchy of stop condition classes for retry logic, with methods for combining conditions. It relies on internal 'tenacity' utilities and threading events for control flow. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The design appears standard for a retry strategy module, with no external data inputs or outputs involved. The code appears safe and intended for controlled retry behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of retry stop condition classes without any malicious behavior, external data handling, or security risks. It is a legitimate component of a retry mechanism and shows no signs of sabotage or malware.",
