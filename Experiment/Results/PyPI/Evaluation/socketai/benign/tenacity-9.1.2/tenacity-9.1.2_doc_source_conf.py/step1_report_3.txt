  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file setting up documentation extensions and paths. It imports standard modules, modifies the sys.path to include project directories, and specifies extensions. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The code appears to be well-formed documentation configuration without obfuscated or malicious segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration file for documentation purposes with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
