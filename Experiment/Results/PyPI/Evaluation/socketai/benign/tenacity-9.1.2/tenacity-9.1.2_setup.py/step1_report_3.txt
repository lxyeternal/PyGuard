  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools with SCM versioning",
  "sources": "Imports the setuptools module, reads setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only configures setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools and calls its setup() function with parameters to use SCM (Source Control Management) for versioning. There are no user inputs, external data reads, or malicious code. The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign and standard setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
