  "purpose": "Define a custom retrying class for Tornado coroutines using the tenacity library to handle retries with sleep intervals.",
  "sources": "Imports from tenacity and tornado modules, use of sys and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output functions identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code primarily sets up a class and methods for retry logic without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. Usage of standard retry patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Tornado-specific retrying class leveraging the tenacity library for handling retries asynchronously. It uses standard libraries and patterns without obfuscation or malicious behavior. No input or output sources, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious network or system calls are present. The code appears to be a straightforward extension for retry logic in asynchronous Python code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a retrying mechanism for Tornado coroutines using the tenacity library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or indicators of malicious intent.",
