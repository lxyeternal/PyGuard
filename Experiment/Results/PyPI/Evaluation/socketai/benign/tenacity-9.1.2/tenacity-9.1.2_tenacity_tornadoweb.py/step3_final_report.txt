{
  "purpose": "Defines a Tornado-specific retry class leveraging tenacity for asynchronous retry logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __call__ method, particularly the function 'fn' and its args/kwargs; the sleep callable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; exception info is handled internally.",
  "flows": "Input 'fn' is called with args/kwargs; exceptions are caught and stored; retries are managed via 'do' objects; sleep is invoked for delays.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Tornado coroutine retry mechanism using tenacity. It manages retries, exceptions, and delays in a typical manner. No malicious behaviors, external communications, or data leaks are present. The use of sys.exc_info() is standard for exception handling. The code structure is clear, well-formed, and adheres to best practices. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a retry utility for Tornado coroutines. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
