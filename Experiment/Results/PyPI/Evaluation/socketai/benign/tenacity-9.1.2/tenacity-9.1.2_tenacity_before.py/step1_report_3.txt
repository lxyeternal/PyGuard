{
  "purpose": "Define retry call strategies, including a no-op and a logging function, for use with the 'tenacity' library.",
  "sources": "Imported modules 'typing' and '_utils' from 'tenacity'; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Logging output generated by 'logger.log' in 'before_log' function.",
  "flows": "The 'before_log' function calls 'logger.log' with constructed messages, based on 'retry_state' attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code is primarily utility functions for logging and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines two functions: 'before_nothing', which is a placeholder doing nothing, and 'before_log', which creates a logging function that logs retry attempts. It uses 'tenacity' utilities to retrieve callback names and format attempt numbers. There are no input or output flows involving untrusted sources beyond standard logging. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for logging retry attempts with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides functions to be used as hooks in retry logic, with safe logging practices.",
