{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for retry mechanisms, specifically a no-op and a logging callback for retry attempts.",
  "sources": "The retry_state object, specifically retry_state.fn and retry_state.attempt_number.",
  "sinks": "The logger.log function, which outputs to a logging sink; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "retry_state.fn (source) is used to get the callback name, and retry_state.attempt_number flows into the log message; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard use of internal utilities and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'before_nothing' which does nothing, and 'before_log' which creates a logging callback that logs retry attempts. It relies on 'tenacity._utils' for utility functions. The code is clear, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. It does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. The logging is standard and safe. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of internal utilities from 'tenacity' is typical for such a library, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is benign, and the structure is straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty about benignity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for retry logging, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
