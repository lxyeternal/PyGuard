{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for retry mechanisms, including a no-op and a logging strategy before function calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'retry_state' object passed to the functions; it also potentially accesses a logger object.",
  "sinks": "Logging occurs via the provided logger, but it does not write untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "retry_state is passed into 'before_nothing' and 'before_log', and within 'before_log', the logger logs information based on retry_state attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard libraries and a third-party 'tenacity' package, with no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of retry callback strategies. 'before_nothing' does nothing, and 'before_log' logs the start of a call with attempt number and function name. It uses 'tenacity' utilities for retrieving callback names and formatting attempt numbers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or anomalous patterns. The code appears to be standard, well-structured utility functions for logging purposes, with no data leakage, code injection, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for retry strategies, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
