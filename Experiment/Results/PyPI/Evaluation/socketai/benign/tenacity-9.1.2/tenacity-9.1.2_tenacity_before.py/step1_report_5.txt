{
  "purpose": "The code defines retry strategies for a Python library, specifically functions to perform no action or log attempts before retrying a function call.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'retry_state' parameter from functions 'before_nothing' and 'before_log'. It also imports 'logging', 'typing', and a utility module '_utils' from 'tenacity'.",
  "sinks": "The code logs information using a logger in 'before_log', which could potentially leak sensitive information if misused. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The 'before_log' function receives a logger and log level, and the returned 'log_it' function uses these to log retry attempts based on 'retry_state'. The flow is: input 'retry_state' → get callback name → log attempt info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, defining retry hooks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a utility module '_utils'. It defines two functions: 'before_nothing' does nothing, serving as a placeholder; 'before_log' returns a logging function that logs retry attempts with details about the callback function and attempt number. The use of 'logging' and 'typing' is standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code's purpose is typical for a retry mechanism in a larger library. No signs of obfuscation or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a retry library, providing logging and no-op hooks. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
