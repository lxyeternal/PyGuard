  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores; Report 4 warrants heightened concern due to obfuscation and network activity. Scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments to reflect the high suspicion level in Report 4. Static analysis suggests moderate risk; further dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation."
