  "purpose": "The script generates README files for distribution packages by reading template files and appending additional information.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'README.rst.in', 'README.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst'; no untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "File writes to 'README.rst' and 'README-dist.rst'; no data leaks or unsafe actions observed.",
  "flows": "Reads from input files -> processes content -> writes to output files; no untrusted data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward with standard file handling.",
  "analysis": "The script processes static files for documentation generation. It uses standard Python libraries (argparse, sys) and performs file I/O with fixed filenames. No external inputs, environment variables, or network activity are involved. The code includes basic string replacements and file concatenations without any dynamic code execution or external command invocation. All functions operate solely on local, predefined files, and no sensitive data handling or credential management is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple documentation generator with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe to use and does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious behavior.",
