  "purpose": "This script generates distribution files (README.rst and README-dist.rst) from template and changelog files for package distribution.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'README.rst.in', 'README.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst'; command-line arguments (though not used for input data).",
  "sinks": "File writes to 'README.rst' and 'README-dist.rst'.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.rst.in', processes string replacements, then writes back; reads 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' to generate 'README-dist.rst'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward file I/O and string processing. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code reads from predefined files and writes processed output to other files. It performs simple string replacements and concatenation. No untrusted input is handled beyond reading static files. The script does not perform any network operations, execute dynamic code, or handle sensitive data. Its purpose is to automate documentation generation without security-sensitive behavior. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard documentation generation script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely reads static files, processes text, and writes output files, with no signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
