  "purpose": "The script generates distribution files (README.rst, README-dist.rst) for a Python project from template and changelog sources.",
  "sources": "Reads input files 'README.rst.in', 'README.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst'.",
  "sinks": "Writes output files 'README.rst' and 'README-dist.rst'.",
  "flows": "Reads from source files and writes to output files; no untrusted data flow from external sources or user input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads specific static files ('README.rst.in', 'README.rst', 'CHANGES.rst') and performs simple string replacements and concatenations. It then writes the processed content to output files. There are no network calls, command execution, or data leaks. The script processes static content only and does not handle any user-supplied input that could be exploited. It contains standard documentation and no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign file generation utility for project documentation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on this code.",
