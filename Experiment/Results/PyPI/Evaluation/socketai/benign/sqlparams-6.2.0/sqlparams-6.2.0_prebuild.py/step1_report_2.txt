    "Read 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' -> concatenate -> write to 'README-dist.rst'"

  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The script performs standard file read/write operations, and the replacements are benign. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads template files and changelog files, performs string replacements on the README content, and writes the processed content back to files. No user input is processed beyond command-line arguments, and no untrusted data sources or network operations are involved. The code functions as a typical build utility without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard build utility for generating documentation files and contains no malicious activity or security risks.",
