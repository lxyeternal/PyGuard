  "purpose": "This script generates files required for source and wheel distributions.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.rst.in', 'README.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst' files.",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'README.rst' and 'README-dist.rst' files.",
  "flows": "Reads static files -> performs string replacements -> concatenates content -> writes output files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static file processing with no dynamic code execution or external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static documentation files, performs benign string replacements, concatenates content, and writes output files. It does not involve untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The logic is simple and intended for documentation generation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The string replacements are benign and serve formatting purposes. The code's behavior aligns with a typical build utility, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward documentation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The code is clear, static, and safe. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and appropriate.",
