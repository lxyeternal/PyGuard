  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the sqlparams library, specifically testing parameter formatting and substitution for SQL queries using different styles and options.",
  "sources": "Reads input SQL strings and parameter lists/dictionaries for each test case.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted SQL strings and parameter lists, which could be injected into SQL queries.",
  "flows": "Source SQL + untrusted parameters → sqlparams formatting functions → formatted SQL + parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code primarily performs parameter substitution and testing. No network operations or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of unit tests verifying SQL parameter formatting functionalities of the sqlparams library. It tests various scenarios such as style conversions, tuple expansions, escaping characters, and multiple parameter occurrences. The tests use standard assertion methods to verify correct output. No dynamic code execution, network access, or system modifications are present. The code does not include any malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The focus is solely on testing the correctness of parameter formatting logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of unit tests for SQL parameter formatting and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for testing the sqlparams library functionalities and does not perform any harmful actions.",
