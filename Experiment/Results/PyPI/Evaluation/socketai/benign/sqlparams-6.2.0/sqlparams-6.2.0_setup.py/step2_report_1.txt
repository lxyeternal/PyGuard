  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the script is minimal, standard, and intended for facilitating editable installs.\n- The code is straightforward: importing `setup` from `setuptools` and calling it with default parameters.\n- No input sources, data processing, sinks, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is minimal and standard, there's little room for malicious activity.\n- The only possible concern could be if this script were part of a larger malicious package, but based solely on this code snippet, no issues are evident.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n- The overall security risk scores are reasonable at 0.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the script is a benign, boilerplate setup utility with no security concerns.",
