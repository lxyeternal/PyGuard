  "purpose": "To facilitate an editable install of a Python package using pip.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows present in this minimal setup script.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no complex logic; no suspicious activity or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with default parameters. It serves solely to enable editable installs, a common practice in Python packaging. There are no sources of external data, no sinks that could leak information or execute malicious actions, and no flows. The code's simplicity indicates it is standard boilerplate for package setup without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup script for enabling editable installs and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
