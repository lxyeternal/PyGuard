  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generation for the project 'SQL Params'.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and project metadata from external modules; reads configuration variables and extensions; reads project info.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or data leak points.",
  "flows": "Imports project metadata at the start; uses configuration values for documentation generation; no data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution; the code is standard for a documentation config file.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no external input handling or dynamic execution. It imports project metadata and sets up documentation options. No potentially malicious or suspicious patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The file does not perform any network activity or system modifications. All imported modules and variables are related to documentation setup and project info, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
