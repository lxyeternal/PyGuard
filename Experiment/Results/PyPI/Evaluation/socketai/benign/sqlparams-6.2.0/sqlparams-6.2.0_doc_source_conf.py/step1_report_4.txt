  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation for the project 'SQL Params'.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'os', 'sys', and '__meta__' from 'sqlparams', and the code itself containing configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "The code primarily flows from importing modules and setting configuration variables without external data processing or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs 'sys.path.insert' and imports metadata; no suspicious code or behavior is present. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic code execution, no input/output handling beyond configuration settings, and no network or system commands. It uses static imports and setting variables for documentation generation. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. All imported modules are standard or related to documentation configuration. There are no suspicious functions, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for generating documentation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It adheres to standard practices without any suspicious or malicious content.",
