  "purpose": "Configuration script for building Sphinx documentation for the 'SQL Params' project.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, sys, and the project's _meta module (__author__, __copyright__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no use of untrusted data inputs, network operations, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code primarily sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "The script imports project metadata (__author__, __copyright__, __version__) directly; these are static, not dynamic inputs. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected. The only dynamic code is setting configuration variables, which is standard for such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration file, importing project metadata and setting options for HTML, LaTeX, and manual output. All code is static configuration with no external data inputs, network calls, or executable code beyond standard imports. The imported __author__, __copyright__, and __version__ are presumed to be static project metadata. There are no suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded malicious logic. The code does not contain any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
