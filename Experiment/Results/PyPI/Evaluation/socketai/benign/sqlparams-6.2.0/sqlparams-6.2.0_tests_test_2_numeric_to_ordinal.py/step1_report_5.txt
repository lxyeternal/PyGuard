  "purpose": "Unit tests for converting numeric parameters to different SQL parameter styles using the sqlparams library.",
  "sources": "Reads source SQL strings and parameter inputs (lists, dicts, tuples).",
  "sinks": "Calls to sqlparams.SQLParams.format() and formatmany() methods that generate SQL queries and parameters.",
  "flows": "Input SQL and parameters are processed through sqlparams methods, resulting in formatted SQL strings and parameter lists. No external data or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code strictly performs testing of a known library for SQL parameter formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises a comprehensive suite of unit tests that verify correct transformation of parameter placeholders across various styles and configurations. All tests involve static data; no user input or network operations are present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, and no data leakage or privacy violations are observed. The tests are designed for predictable, safe behavior, with exception handling only for expected errors related to input validation.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a set of well-structured, benign unit tests for a SQL parameter formatting library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code is purely for testing functionality without any external or harmful actions.",
