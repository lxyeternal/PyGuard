  "purpose": "Unit tests for converting numeric SQL parameters to different formats and expanding tuples.",
  "sources": "Reads SQL query strings and parameter data from variables within test methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or perform unsafe operations; it primarily formats SQL strings and prepares parameters.",
  "flows": "Input SQL and parameters flow into the 'format' and 'formatmany' methods of 'sqlparams.SQLParams', producing formatted SQL strings and parameter lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No code injection or unsafe SQL execution is performed; all SQL is static and parameterized.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test cases for the 'sqlparams' library, which converts SQL parameters between formats and handles tuple expansion. No external data input, network communication, or system modification occurs. The tests manipulate strings and data structures locally, and the 'sqlparams' methods are assumed to perform safe formatting. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for a SQL parameter formatting library. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. All operations are within the scope of testing string formatting and parameter handling, with no external or unsafe actions detected.",
