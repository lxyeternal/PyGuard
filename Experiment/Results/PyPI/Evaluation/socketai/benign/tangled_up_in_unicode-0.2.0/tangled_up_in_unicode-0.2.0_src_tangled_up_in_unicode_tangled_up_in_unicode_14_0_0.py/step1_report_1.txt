  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve Unicode character properties and mappings from data structures, including character names, categories, bidirectional classes, numeric values, decompositions, and script/block information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported dictionaries such as unicode_data_to_name_start, unicode_data_to_category_start/end, unicode_data_to_bidirectional_start/end, and other property alias mappings. It also reads character input via the 'chr' parameter, converting to ord() integers for lookups.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include returning property strings, category labels, or mapping results directly based on input characters. No untrusted data is written to external systems or network, nor are there code execution functions.",
  "flows": "Input character -> ord() -> data structure lookup (e.g., unicode_data_to_name_start) -> return value. For range-based properties, bisect searches determine the range, then values are retrieved and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive data lookups with sorted keys and bisect, which are standard for range-based data. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic code execution detected. No evidence of malicious network activity or data exfiltration. All data sources appear to be static Unicode property mappings.",
  "analysis": "The module is a Unicode property utility, with functions to access character data from large preloaded datasets. The functions utilize safe data access patterns, with exception handling for missing keys. No code executes untrusted data as code, no external system calls or network access occur, and no suspicious logic or backdoors are detected. The code structure and data handling are consistent with a data lookup library, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Unicode data utility module for character property lookups. It performs standard data access patterns without suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious actions. No malware or security risks are evident from the provided code.",
