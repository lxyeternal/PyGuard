{
  "purpose": "This code provides Unicode character data retrieval functions, such as name, category, bidirectional class, numeric values, decomposition, case conversions, block, script, and various property mappings.",
  "sources": "Data sources include imported data modules containing mappings for Unicode properties, which are used in functions that access these mappings via character code points.",
  "sinks": "The functions read from data dictionaries and return Unicode property information; no untrusted input is directly used for destructive operations. No network or file I/O is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Unicode data dictionaries through index calculations (based on ordinals) to return property values; no external or untrusted data flow into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution, are observed. The code is straightforward data access with standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Unicode property lookups based on character code points, utilizing binary search to find the relevant data in sorted keys, then returning associated property values. The functions handle missing data gracefully by returning defaults or raising exceptions as appropriate. There are no network operations, code injection, or obfuscated code segments. All imported data appears to be static mappings intended for Unicode processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard Unicode data retrieval implementation. It performs no malicious actions or suspicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code is well-structured and seems to serve its intended purpose securely.",
