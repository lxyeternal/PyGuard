{
  "purpose": "Provides Unicode property functions and mappings based on static data tables for character analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads character code points via ord() and accesses preloaded static dictionaries and lists for properties.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is retrieved from static in-memory structures, with no network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input character code point -> lookup in static data structures -> return property value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Unicode property utility that performs lookups in static data modules, using standard range checks and exception handling. It does not perform any external communication, dynamic code execution, or data modification. The functions are simple, predictable, and rely solely on preloaded Unicode data, indicating no malicious intent or obfuscation. The extensive data imports are typical for Unicode processing libraries. No signs of backdoors, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static Unicode property lookup utility with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate, reflecting the low security concern primarily due to reliance on external data modules, which are standard Unicode datasets. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
