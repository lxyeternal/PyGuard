{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for Unicode character property retrieval, including name, category, bidirectional class, numeric values, decomposition, case mappings, East Asian width, block, script, and related property lookups, primarily based on precomputed lookup tables.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include Unicode data tables imported from tangled_up_in_unicode.u14_0_0_data modules, with lookups based on character code points (ord values) and dictionary keys.",
  "sinks": "Functions utilize dictionary lookups, bisect operations on sorted key lists, and return property strings, integers, or floats. No external system interactions or network operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves reading character code points (sources), performing lookups in data structures, and returning property values or defaults. No untrusted input flows into unsafe sinks, and no data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected; functions perform standard Unicode property retrieval without any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code structure is consistent, with no unusual control flow or obfuscation features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Unicode property lookups, relying on precomputed data structures. All lookups are within safe, contained data structures, and no external or network interactions are present. The import statements are extensive but solely import data modules. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The functions include proper error handling, default fallbacks, and are consistent with typical Unicode property retrieval implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard Unicode data lookups with no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It appears to be a benign utility module for Unicode property access, with no suspicious anomalies or security concerns identified.",
