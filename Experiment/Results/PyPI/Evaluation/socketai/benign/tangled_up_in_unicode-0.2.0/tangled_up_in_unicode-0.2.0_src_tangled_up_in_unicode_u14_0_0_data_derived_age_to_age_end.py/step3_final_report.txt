{
  "purpose": "A large static dictionary mapping Unicode code point ranges or similar categorization data, likely used for character classification or encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data reads; static data embedded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; purely static lookup data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; the dictionary is used as a static lookup table.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no obfuscation, no malicious code, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive static dictionary with integer keys and values, probably representing Unicode code point ranges or blocks. It contains no functions, external data access, or dynamic behavior. The data appears to serve as a lookup table for character classification or encoding, which is common in text processing libraries. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The large numeric values align with Unicode code points and ranges, indicating a benign purpose. The absence of external interactions or code execution further supports its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, Unicode-related mapping table with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It is benign and used for character classification or similar purposes. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, and the overall assessment confirms its safety.",
