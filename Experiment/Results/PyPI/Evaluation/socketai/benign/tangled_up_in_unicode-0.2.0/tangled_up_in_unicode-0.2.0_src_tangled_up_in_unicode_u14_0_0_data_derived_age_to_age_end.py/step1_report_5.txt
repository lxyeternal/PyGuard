{
  "purpose": "This code defines a large dictionary mapping integers to other integers, likely representing ranges or intervals for some classification or lookup purpose.",
  "sources": "The code itself is a static data structure; there are no input sources, data reads, or external data dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no data outputs, network operations, file writes, or other sinks that could leak data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Since it is a static dictionary assignment, there are no data flows from sources to sinks or any dynamic execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "The dictionary contains extremely large integer keys with no context or comments explaining their meaning. No dynamic code, obfuscated code, or functions are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. The code is straightforward data initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a plain static dictionary assignment with a large number of integer key-value pairs. There are no functions, no external data access, no network operations, or other malicious behaviors. The data appears to be a mapping, possibly for character or Unicode range classification, but no evidence of malicious intent is present. The structure and format are consistent and not obfuscated. The presence of extensive large key-value pairs without context is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, this code is a benign static data structure without malicious behavior. It likely serves as a lookup table for some classification or processing task. There are no indicators of malware, data leaks, or malicious functions.",
