{
  "purpose": "This code defines a mapping of integer keys to their corresponding end values, likely used for range-based lookup or categorization.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or outputs; the code is a static data structure definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a large static dictionary with numeric keys and values, without any functions, logic, or data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static mapping of numeric ranges or codes, potentially representing Unicode ranges or code point intervals, to their corresponding end points. It contains no functions, external calls, or dynamic behavior. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are observable. The structure appears purely data-driven, serving as a lookup table, possibly for character or code point categorization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a static lookup table with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a straightforward data structure likely used for range mapping purposes. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.",
