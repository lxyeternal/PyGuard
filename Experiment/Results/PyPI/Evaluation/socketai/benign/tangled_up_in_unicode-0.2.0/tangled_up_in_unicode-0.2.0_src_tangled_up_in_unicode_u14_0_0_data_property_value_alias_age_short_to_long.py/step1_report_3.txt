{
  "purpose": "Define a mapping dictionary to alias short to long property values based on numerical keys",
  "sources": "The dictionary assignment itself, which contains hardcoded string keys and values",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from external sources, nor written to untrusted destinations",
  "flows": "N/A; static data structure, no data flow from untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward dictionary definition with static data",
  "analysis": "The code is a static assignment of a Python dictionary mapping numeric string keys to string values, and an 'NA' key mapped to 'Unassigned'. There are no input sources, no data transformations, and no output sinks. No code execution, no external data reading, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation present. The data appears to be a simple property value alias mapping, likely for use in a larger program.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static dictionary defining mappings. There is no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard data structure setup with no malicious intent.",
