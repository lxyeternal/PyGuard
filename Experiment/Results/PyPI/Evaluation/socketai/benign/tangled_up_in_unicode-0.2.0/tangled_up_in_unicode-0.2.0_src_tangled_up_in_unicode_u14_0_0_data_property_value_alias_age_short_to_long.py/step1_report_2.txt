  "purpose": "Defines a dictionary mapping string keys representing property values to corresponding alias strings.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static dictionary declaration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data being processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "None; static mapping without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary assignment in Python, mapping string keys to string values. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present. It appears to be a simple lookup table for property value aliases.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, representing a static mapping dictionary with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
