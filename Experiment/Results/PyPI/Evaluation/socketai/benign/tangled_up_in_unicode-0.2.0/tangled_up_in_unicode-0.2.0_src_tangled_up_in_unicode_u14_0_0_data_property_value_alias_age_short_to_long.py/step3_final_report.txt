  "purpose": "A static dictionary mapping string property value aliases to their normalized long-form labels, used for data normalization or aliasing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the predefined dictionary keys; no external input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data; it only provides a static mapping.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the dictionary is static and used for lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary mapping string keys to string values, serving as a lookup table for property value normalization. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with confidence=1. There are no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's static, transparent structure. The code's purpose is data normalization, and it poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static mapping dictionary with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or modification is necessary.",
