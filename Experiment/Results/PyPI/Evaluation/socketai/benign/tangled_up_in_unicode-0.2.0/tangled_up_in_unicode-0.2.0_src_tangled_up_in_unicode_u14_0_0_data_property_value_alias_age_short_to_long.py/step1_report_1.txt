  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping string representations of decimal numbers to specific version labels, possibly for data normalization or referencing.",
  "sources": "The code itself does not read input or data; it is a static data structure definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks within this code snippet; it only defines a constant dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python dictionary assignment mapping string keys to string values. It appears to be used for lookups or label conversions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code is static and simple, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data mapping without any malicious intent or security risks.",
