  "purpose": "Define a mapping dictionary from short property value aliases to long format labels.",
  "sources": "The dictionary itself is a static data structure; no input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The dictionary may be used as a lookup table in code; no direct data sinks or outputs are evident here.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks in this static declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary mapping string keys to string values. It contains only string literals, with no dynamic code execution, external data input, or network interactions. The data appears to be used for property value aliasing or normalization, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple static mapping dictionary without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a benign purpose related to data normalization.",
