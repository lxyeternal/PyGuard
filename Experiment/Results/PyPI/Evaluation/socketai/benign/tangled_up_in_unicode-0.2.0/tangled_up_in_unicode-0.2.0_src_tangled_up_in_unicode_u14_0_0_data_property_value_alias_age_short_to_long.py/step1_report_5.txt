  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping string keys representing numeric property values to standardized alias strings.",
  "sources": "The dictionary is statically defined; no external input or data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external sources or sinks; the dictionary is a static constant.",
  "anomalies": "The dictionary contains a straightforward mapping with no obfuscated code, unusual syntax, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No dynamic code execution or external calls are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary initialization that maps specific string keys to string values, likely for property value aliasing or normalization. There are no input/output operations, no suspicious code constructs, and no indications of malicious intent. The structure is simple and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign static data structure used for mapping purposes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
