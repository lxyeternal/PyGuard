{
  "purpose": "This dictionary maps numerical identifiers (likely Unicode or code point ranges) to version strings, probably representing categorization or metadata about character ranges or code points.",
  "sources": "The code defines a static dictionary with hardcoded numerical keys and string values; there are no external inputs or data reads.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network communication, file writes, environment variable usage, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code is static data assignment with no processing or data movement from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The extensive static mapping of large numerical ranges with version-like string values is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a large, static dictionary mapping numeric keys to string values. The data appears to classify or label Unicode or similar code point ranges with version strings. There are no input operations, no functions, no network or system calls. The structure is straightforward and static, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or sabotage. The context suggests it is a data reference or configuration component.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign static data mapping used for categorization or reference purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward data structure with no dynamic or external dependencies.",
