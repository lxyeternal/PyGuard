{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping numeric keys to version strings, likely used for categorizing or referencing age ranges or version numbers in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code itself does not read input or data; it only contains a static data structure definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code is purely a data declaration without runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The large static dictionary appears normal for configuration or mapping data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large static dictionary with numeric keys mapped to string values indicating version or age labels. There are no function calls, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The data appears consistent with version or categorization data. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or hidden behavior are detectable. The structure and content are typical for configuration data used in software systems.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static data structure used for mapping numeric values to string labels. It contains no malicious code or behavior and does not pose security risks.",
