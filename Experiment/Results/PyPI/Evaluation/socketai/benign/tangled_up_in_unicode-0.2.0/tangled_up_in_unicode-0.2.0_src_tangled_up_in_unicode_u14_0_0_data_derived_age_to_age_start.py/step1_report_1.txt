  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping numerical keys to string values representing derived age ranges.",
  "sources": "Dictionary initialization with hard-coded numerical keys and string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; only data initialization present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hard-coded keys to the dictionary object; no untrusted input processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The dictionary contains a large number of hard-coded numerical keys, some with very high values, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, especially given the presence of very large numbers associated with specific values like '2.0' and '13.0'. The pattern of the keys and values does not correspond to typical usage and may serve as an encoded or obfuscated data structure.",
  "analysis": "The code solely involves static initialization of a dictionary with many entries. No dynamic code execution, data input, network communication, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The extensive hard-coding of numeric keys—some extremely high—raises suspicion of potential obfuscation or embedding of malicious data. The specific key-value pairs appear to serve as a lookup table, possibly for internal logic or encoding purposes. However, without further context, it is not possible to determine if this is malicious or benign; the pattern suggests potential for concealment or malicious obfuscation. The absence of any further logic, functions, or code flow limits the evaluation to static data presence.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of a large static dictionary mapping numeric keys to string values. While no active malicious behavior is directly observable, the extensive use of high-valued keys and seemingly arbitrary data could indicate obfuscation or encoding intended to hide malicious intent. Further context is needed to confirm intent; as it stands, the code alone does not exhibit active malicious behavior but warrants suspicion due to its obfuscation potential.",
