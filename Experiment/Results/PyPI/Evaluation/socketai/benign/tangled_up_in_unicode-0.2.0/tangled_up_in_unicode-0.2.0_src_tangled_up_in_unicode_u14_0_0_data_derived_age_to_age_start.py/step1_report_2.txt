{
  "purpose": "This code defines a large dictionary mapping numerical keys to string values representing age start points.",
  "sources": "The dictionary itself is a static data structure, with no input or external data sources read within this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is being processed or output in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code is purely static data definition.",
  "anomalies": "The dictionary contains a very extensive set of hardcoded numerical keys with specific string values, some of which are large or unusual (e.g., large Unicode code points). No suspicious or malicious patterns like hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The data appears to be a lookup table for age classifications, with no dynamic code execution or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static assignment of a large dictionary with numerous entries. No input, output, or control flow is present. The data appears to be a comprehensive mapping potentially used for categorizing or transforming age-related data. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The structure and content are straightforward and consistent with a data lookup table. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are detected. The code's purpose seems to be providing static mappings, not executing any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a large, static dictionary mapping code points or IDs to age-related strings. There is no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns identified. It appears to be a benign dataset used for classification or lookup purposes.",
