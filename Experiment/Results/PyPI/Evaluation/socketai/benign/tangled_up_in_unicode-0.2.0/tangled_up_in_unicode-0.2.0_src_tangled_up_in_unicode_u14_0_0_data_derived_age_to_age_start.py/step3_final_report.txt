  "purpose": "Large static dictionary mapping numeric keys to string values, likely for internal categorization or lookup purposes.",
  "sources": "The dictionary itself; no external data or dynamic input involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data used for lookups.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond static initialization; no active code execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extremely high numeric keys (some exceeding 1 million) and arbitrary string values, which could suggest obfuscation or concealed data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static large dictionary with numeric keys and string values, possibly Unicode ranges or internal codes. The pattern of large, seemingly arbitrary keys and values like '2.0' and '13.0' raises suspicion of obfuscation or hidden encoding. However, no active malicious behavior, network activity, or code execution is present. The data appears to serve as a lookup table, and the high keys are typical in Unicode or encoding mappings. The suspicion is moderate but not confirmed as malicious. The scores reflect this: malware 0.2, obfuscated 0.3, risk 0.3, confidence 0.6.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static data mapping, likely benign, but the pattern of large, high-value keys warrants caution. No active malicious activity is evident. The scores are appropriate given the suspicion but lack of concrete malicious indicators.",
