{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python dictionary mapping short property value aliases to their full descriptive names.",
  "sources": "The dictionary is a static assignment within the code; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, files, or network resources; the code only stores static data.",
  "flows": "Since the data is static, there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a static dictionary definition with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static dictionary mapping strings to other strings. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are detected. The data appears to be a mapping for property code aliases, typical for configuration or lookup tables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static data structure for lookups with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not perform any operations that could be considered malicious.",
