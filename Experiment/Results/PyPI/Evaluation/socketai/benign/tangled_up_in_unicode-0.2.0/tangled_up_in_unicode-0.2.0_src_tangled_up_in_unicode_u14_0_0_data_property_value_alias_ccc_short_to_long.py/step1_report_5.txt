  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping short property value aliases to their full descriptive names.",
  "sources": "The dictionary initialization is the primary source; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data or perform any output or system actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to output or other sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary assignment, mapping string keys to string values. It does not contain dynamic code execution, input handling, network communication, or other typical indicators of malicious behavior. All elements are constants; no suspicious patterns are evident. The code is likely intended for reference or data translation purposes within a larger program.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple static data mapping with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
