  "purpose": "Define a mapping dictionary for property value aliases from short codes to long descriptive names.",
  "sources": "The dictionary is hardcoded within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code simply declares a static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary declaration used for mapping property value aliases. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or suspicious logic are present. It appears to be a benign configuration or reference data structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple static mapping dictionary with no malicious behavior, security issues, or suspicious activity. It serves as a reference for alias conversions and does not pose any security risk.",
