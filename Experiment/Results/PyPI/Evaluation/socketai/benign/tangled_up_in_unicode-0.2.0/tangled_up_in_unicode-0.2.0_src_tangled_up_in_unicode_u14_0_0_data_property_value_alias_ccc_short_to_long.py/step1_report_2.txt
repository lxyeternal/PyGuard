  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary mapping short property value aliases to their corresponding long descriptive names.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a static dictionary declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code is a static data structure without functions or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The dictionary appears to be a straightforward mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static dictionary assignment with key-value pairs mapping short codes to descriptive strings. It contains no dynamic or untrusted input handling, no code execution, no network operations, and no suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The content is purely data declaration intended for lookups or mappings within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static mapping dictionary with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
