  "purpose": "Mapping of property value aliases from short codes to full descriptive names.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionary definition within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; data is static and not derived from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignment, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code is a straightforward static dictionary.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static Python dictionary mapping short string codes to longer descriptive strings. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no sensitive information exposure. The structure is simple and clear, serving as a lookup table. No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets beyond the mapping itself. No signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign static mapping dictionary used for translating short property value codes to their full descriptions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this snippet.",
