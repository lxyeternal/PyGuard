  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static dictionary mapping short codes to descriptive names.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code, or input processing are involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The content appears to be a straightforward lookup table, likely used for property code translations.\n\n**Confirmations & Discrepancies:**\n- The code itself is benign; no issues are present in the actual code snippet.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, which is appropriate given the static nature and clarity of the code.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward dictionary.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified because the code is static and non-sensitive.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely static data, there are no signs of malicious intent.\n- The only possible concern could be if this mapping were manipulated or replaced in an attack scenario, but that is outside the scope of static code review without context of deployment or version control.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign static dictionary with no malicious or security issues. The scores and reasoning in all reports are appropriate and justified.",
