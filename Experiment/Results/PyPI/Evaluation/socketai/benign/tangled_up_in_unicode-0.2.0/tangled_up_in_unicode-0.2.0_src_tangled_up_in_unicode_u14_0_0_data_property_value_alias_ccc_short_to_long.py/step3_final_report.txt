  "purpose": "Static dictionary mapping short property value aliases to descriptive strings for property code translation.",
  "sources": "None; static data defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data with no data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static dictionary with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python dictionary with key-value pairs mapping short string codes to descriptive names. It involves no dynamic behavior, external input, network activity, or code execution. The data appears to serve as a configuration or lookup table. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature make it inherently benign. All reports correctly identify the code as a benign static mapping, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics, and no further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static lookup dictionary with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
