{
  "purpose": "The code imports Unicode property functions and constants from a specific Unicode data module and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tangled_up_in_unicode.tangled_up_in_unicode_14_0_0' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static import/export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports a set of Unicode property functions/constants and defines metadata (__version__, __all__). It contains no dynamic code, no external data handling, and no network activity. All imported symbols are standard Unicode data, and the structure is straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose appears to be to expose Unicode data for use elsewhere, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward Unicode data module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. All assessments and scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
