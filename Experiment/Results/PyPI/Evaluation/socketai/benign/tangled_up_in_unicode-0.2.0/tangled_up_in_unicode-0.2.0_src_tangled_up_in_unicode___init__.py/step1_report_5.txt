{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import specific Unicode data and functions from a package named 'tangled_up_in_unicode', likely for use in Unicode data processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tangled_up_in_unicode.tangled_up_in_unicode_14_0_0', a package that presumably provides Unicode properties and data.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code only imports data and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and defines module metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a series of variables and functions from a specific Unicode data package version and defines the __version__ and __all__ attributes. It does not process, execute, or manipulate data at runtime. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, backdoors, or obfuscation. The package appears to be a straightforward Unicode data module for use in other projects.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks within this code. It functions solely as a module for importing Unicode properties and defining module metadata.",
