{
  "purpose": "This code module imports various Unicode property functions and data from a package named 'tangled_up_in_unicode' and defines metadata such as version and export list.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'tangled_up_in_unicode.tangled_up_in_unicode_14_0_0'; reading package modules and attributes",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or external network communications",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely performs imports and defines constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import and export definition for a Python package. It imports a large set of functions and data related to Unicode properties from an internal module, then defines a version string and an all-list for exports. There are no inputs, network operations, or data manipulations that could lead to security issues or malicious behavior. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py or similar module. No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on exposing Unicode property functions and data. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
