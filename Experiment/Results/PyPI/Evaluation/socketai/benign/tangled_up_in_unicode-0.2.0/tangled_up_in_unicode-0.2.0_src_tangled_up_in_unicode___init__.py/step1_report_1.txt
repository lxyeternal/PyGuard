{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import specific Unicode property functions and constants from a module named 'tangled_up_in_unicode.tangled_up_in_unicode_14_0_0' and expose them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'tangled_up_in_unicode.tangled_up_in_unicode_14_0_0', and the assignment of '__version__' and '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code only performs imports and defines metadata variables.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process external input or perform any data manipulation beyond imports and variable definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The imported module's name suggests Unicode data handling, which is benign by itself.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific Unicode property functions and constants from an external module, then defines a version string and an __all__ list for module exports. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. All elements serve to structure and re-export Unicode-related data, which appears typical for a Python package module dedicated to Unicode properties. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The module's purpose seems to be providing Unicode data to other parts of an application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to be a benign module that imports Unicode property data and exports it. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. It is safe based on the provided content.",
