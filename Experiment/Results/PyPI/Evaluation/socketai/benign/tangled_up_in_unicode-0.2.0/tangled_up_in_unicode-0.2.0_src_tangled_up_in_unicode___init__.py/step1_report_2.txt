{
  "purpose": "This module imports specific Unicode property functions and constants from an external package named 'tangled_up_in_unicode'. Its purpose appears to be to expose Unicode data and utilities for use in other parts of a project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported module 'tangled_up_in_unicode.tangled_up_in_unicode_14_0_0'. It does not take external input from users, network, files, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks such as network communications, file writes, or execution of untrusted data. The code simply re-exports imported items and sets a version string.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the flow is limited to importing and exporting symbols within the package/module scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The version string is hardcoded but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly imports a predefined set of Unicode property functions and constants from a specific package version. It then sets a version string and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no inputs, no data manipulation, and no execution logic that could be malicious. The import source is a package, which, assuming it is a legitimate and trusted package, does not pose a security risk by itself. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports functions and constants from a Unicode data package. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign module setup.",
