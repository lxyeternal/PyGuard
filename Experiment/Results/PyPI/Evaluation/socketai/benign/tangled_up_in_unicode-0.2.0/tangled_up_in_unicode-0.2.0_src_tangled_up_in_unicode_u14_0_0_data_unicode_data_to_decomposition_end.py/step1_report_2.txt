{
  "purpose": "The code defines a dictionary mapping a specific Unicode code point to another, likely for data transformation or normalization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a hardcoded dictionary definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the dictionary is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a minimal mapping with no apparent context, no functions, and no user input handling. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a simple static dictionary with a single Unicode code point mapping. It appears to be part of a larger normalization or transformation process. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity. The code does not process external inputs, and there are no actions or functions that could cause harm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data structure with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward mapping used for Unicode normalization or similar purposes.",
