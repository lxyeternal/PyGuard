{
  "purpose": "The code defines a dictionary mapping specific Unicode code points to other code points, likely for text processing or normalization purposes.",
  "sources": "The dictionary itself, which is a static data structure; no external input or data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single dictionary with a hardcoded Unicode mapping; no anomalies such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static dictionary assignment, mapping Unicode code point 55203 to 44032. This appears to be part of a larger text normalization or Unicode processing routine. No external inputs, no functions, no complex logic, and no suspicious patterns are present. There is no indication of malicious intent or security issues within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and straightforward, serving as a Unicode mapping table. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
