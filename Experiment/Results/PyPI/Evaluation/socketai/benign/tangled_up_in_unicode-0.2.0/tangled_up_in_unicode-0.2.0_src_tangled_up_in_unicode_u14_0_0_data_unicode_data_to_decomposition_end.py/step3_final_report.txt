  "purpose": "Static Unicode mapping table for normalization or decomposition purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input; static dictionary defined in code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data flow or output.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data structure, no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Single hardcoded Unicode code point mapping; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static dictionary mapping one Unicode code point (55203) to another (44032). It contains no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. The code likely serves Unicode normalization functions and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its static, straightforward nature.",
