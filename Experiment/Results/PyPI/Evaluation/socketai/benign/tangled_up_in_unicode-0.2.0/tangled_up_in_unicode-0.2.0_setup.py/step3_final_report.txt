  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports standard modules; uses find_packages and setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or dynamic operations; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads local file and passes data to setup(); no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script for a Python package. It reads a local README file with explicit encoding, defines dependencies explicitly, and calls setup() with package metadata and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All dependencies are standard and explicitly listed. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or introduce security vulnerabilities. The absence of dynamic behavior, network activity, or obfuscated code indicates a benign intent. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
