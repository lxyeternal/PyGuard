{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'tangled_up_in_unicode', including dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing standard modules (pathlib, setuptools).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no execution or external data transmission in the code.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves reading a local file ('README.md') to assign to 'long_description' during package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads a local README file securely with explicit encoding, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata. Dependencies are explicitly specified or empty, with no dynamic or unsafe code execution present. The code follows conventional packaging practices without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears safe and intended for legitimate package distribution.",
