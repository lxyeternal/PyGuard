{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for Unicode data retrieval and classification, such as character names, categories, bidirectional properties, scripts, and related mappings, mainly for Unicode version 13.0.0.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from various imported dictionaries like unicode_data_to_name_start, unicode_data_to_category_start/end, etc., which are populated externally. Input is via Unicode characters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include returning data such as character properties, categories, or mapped long/short values. No direct external output or system calls are present that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Input Unicode character → determines index via ord() → looks up properties in dictionaries or data structures → returns classification or mapping based on data. No external system interactions or untrusted data processing are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The functions are straightforward data lookups and classifications. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Unicode data lookup patterns, with sorted key lists and bisect to efficiently find character properties. All data accessed are from pre-defined external dictionaries, and error handling is via standard exceptions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or external data leaks. No operations suggest system sabotage or malicious activities. The overall structure is typical for Unicode property retrieval modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Unicode property lookup implementation that reads from external data sources. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It solely provides classification and mapping functions based on pre-existing Unicode data, with proper error handling. Therefore, it appears safe and secure.",
