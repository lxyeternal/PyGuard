  "purpose": "This code provides functions for Unicode character property retrieval, including names, categories, scripts, and various property mappings, for Unicode version 13.0.0.",
  "sources": "Code reads character input via the 'chr' parameter, converting characters to their Unicode code points and then querying large property data dictionaries. Data sources include unicode_data_to_* mappings and alias mappings for property values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data; it primarily reads from data structures and returns properties. No apparent sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input character → Unicode code point → property data dictionaries or alias mappings → return of property value or property name.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. Use of large data dictionaries is typical for Unicode data handling and appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Unicode property lookups using standard binary search via bisect and dictionary lookups, with exception handling for missing data. Functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or data leakage mechanisms. All data access is read-only, and no external or network interactions occur. The data structures are imported and used solely for property retrieval, consistent with standard Unicode processing libraries. No suspicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, remote connections, or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Unicode data lookup implementation supporting character property queries. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals are detected. The structure and content suggest it is a legitimate Unicode processing module with no security concerns.",
