  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides Unicode property functions, reading from external dictionaries. Input is via Unicode characters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are straightforward, with no external system calls or untrusted data handling beyond lookups.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is a standard Unicode property retrieval module.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard, with no malicious behavior. Confidence is high (1), malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a safe Unicode property lookup library with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; functions for Unicode character data, relying on imported data modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system calls; data accessed via in-memory structures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Also appears safe and legitimate. Slightly lower confidence (0.95), malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the first; no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; data from Unicode data modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication, just in-memory lookups.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious code. The only concern is reliance on large data modules, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard Unicode lookup code. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected; the minor security risk is likely due to data dependency, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar Unicode property functions, data from imported modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are predictable; no external system interaction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Use of exception handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate Unicode data lookup; very low security risk. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; data from Unicode data modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard data retrieval, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Repeated sorting of dictionary keys in each function is inefficient but not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate Unicode data access, minimal security risk. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Unicode property lookup library.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The only minor concern is reliance on external data modules and repeated sorting, which is a performance issue, not a security concern.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The security risks are minimal and related to data dependency, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and non-obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, due to data dependency, but not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard Unicode property lookup implementation with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It is safe for use and does not pose security risks beyond the typical dependency on external data.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment is consistent with all provided reports and the detailed analysis.",
