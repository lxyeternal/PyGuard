{
  "purpose": "Provides Unicode character property functions based on external data dictionaries, enabling retrieval of character names, categories, bidirectional properties, numeric values, decompositions, case mappings, and script/block classifications.",
  "sources": "Reads input characters, converts to code points, and performs dictionary lookups for various Unicode properties.",
  "sinks": "No external system interactions; data is retrieved from in-memory dictionaries and data structures.",
  "flows": "Input character -> code point -> dictionary lookup -> output property value.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated sorting of dictionary keys in each function introduces inefficiency but no malicious activity; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward Unicode property lookups using in-memory data structures imported from external modules. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. Error handling via exceptions is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed. The reliance on external data modules is typical for Unicode processing libraries and does not constitute a security risk. The code is clear, well-structured, and functions as a static data retrieval module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Unicode property lookup library with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (0.1) are appropriate. The code does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior and is safe for use.",
