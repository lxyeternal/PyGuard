  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. The code only imports functions from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' with no further processing.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning is sound; the fallback import pattern is standard.  \n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature. The security risk is also 0.  \n- **Justification:** The code does not execute any malicious behavior, does not handle untrusted data, nor obfuscate code. The confidence is high.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to report 1, just extensive imports with fallback.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no data processing, no obfuscation.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern of conditional imports.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The analysis correctly states that the code is benign.  \n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation.  \n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. It’s a large import block with fallback, standard practice.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscation.  \n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern of imports with fallback.  \n- **Errors or flaws?** No. The analysis is correct.  \n- **Scores?** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, no data handling, no obfuscation.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code is solely for importing utility functions with fallback mechanisms.  \n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0, since there's no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, because the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard dependency management with fallback, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.",
