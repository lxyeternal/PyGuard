  "purpose": "Import functions from 'cytoolz' or fallback to 'toolz' for utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behavior; extensive import list is typical for utility libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a comprehensive set of functions from 'cytoolz', and if unavailable, from 'toolz', using a try-except fallback. The imported functions are utility functions for functional programming and data manipulation. The pattern is standard for dependency fallback and does not execute any code beyond imports. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code beyond imports. The extensive import list is typical for utility libraries and does not indicate malicious intent. The fallback pattern is common and benign. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency fallback pattern for importing utility functions, with no malicious or security concerns. It poses no threat and is standard in open-source projects.",
