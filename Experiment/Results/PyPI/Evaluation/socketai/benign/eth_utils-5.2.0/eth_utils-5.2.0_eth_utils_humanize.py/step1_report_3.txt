{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting, humanizing, and parsing data such as time durations, byte sequences, hashes, URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "None of the functions appear to read untrusted input directly; data inputs are parameters or external functions (e.g., parse.urlparse). The only external input validation is in 'is_ipfs_uri' and 'humanize_ipfs_uri'.",
  "sinks": "Formatting functions output strings; no apparent sinks that could cause data leakage or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily reads input parameters and produces formatted string outputs; there are no flows that execute untrusted code or leak data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and primarily involves data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various humanization and formatting utilities with clear, standard implementations. It includes functions for representing time durations, bytes, hashes, URIs, and integer sequences. Input validation in 'is_ipfs_uri' and 'humanize_ipfs_uri' is appropriate and does not involve insecure handling. No suspicious behaviors such as network communication, file access, or credential handling are detected. The functions rely on safe standard library modules and simple data manipulations. Overall, the code appears benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data formatting utilities without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, straightforward, and does not contain harmful or suspicious code. No security concerns are identified.",
