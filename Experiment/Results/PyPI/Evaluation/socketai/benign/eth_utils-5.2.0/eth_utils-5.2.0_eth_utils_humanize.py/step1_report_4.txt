{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for human-readable formatting of time, bytes, hex strings, IPFS URIs, integer sequences, and Wei units, mainly for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data includes function parameters such as bytes, strings, URIs, integers, and iterables. The only external data parsing occurs in parse.urlparse for URI validation.",
  "sinks": "Sinks involve string formatting and parsing functions; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or system commands. No dangerous data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs through formatting and parsing functions. No external command execution, file writing, or network communication is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicate normal utility functions. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of formatting utilities that convert data such as seconds, bytes, hex strings, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences into human-readable forms. It performs input validation, parsing, and formatting without any external side effects. The only data source involving external input is URL parsing for IPFS URIs, which is used solely for validation and display formatting. No malicious behaviors like network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The code appears to serve purely presentational and validation purposes, with secure and straightforward logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of formatting and validation utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for display purposes without performing any harmful actions or data leaks.",
