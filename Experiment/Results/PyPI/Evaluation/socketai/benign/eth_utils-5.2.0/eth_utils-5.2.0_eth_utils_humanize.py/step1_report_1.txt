{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integers, mainly for formatting and display purposes.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read untrusted input directly; most operate on provided arguments. The functions that parse or validate data (e.g., humanize_ipfs_uri, is_ipfs_uri) check for specific formats.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could leak untrusted data, execute commands, or perform unsafe operations. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code predominantly formats or processes data passed as arguments without external input manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward formatting utilities with proper validation checks where necessary.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of formatting and humanization functions for various data types, such as durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integers. It uses safe parsing methods, checks for valid IPFS CIDv0 hashes, and limits output length for hashes to prevent leaks. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation was observed. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection points. The logic is standard for utility formatting libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe utility module designed for formatting and displaying data, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
