  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the described functions and their behaviors with the security considerations, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integers. It states no untrusted input reading, no data leaks, no external system interaction, and no suspicious behaviors. It concludes the code is safe.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are straightforward formatting utilities. The only validation occurs in `is_ipfs_uri` and `humanize_ipfs_uri`, which check for CIDv0 format. No network, file, or command execution is involved. The logic is simple and safe.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct; no malicious behavior detected)\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct; code is clear)\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate; no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe data handling, no external system calls, no malicious behaviors, and proper validation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are safe, primarily formatting and validation. No network or system access, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—utility functions for formatting, safe validation, no external interactions, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** All functions operate on passed parameters, with validation where necessary. No network, file, or command execution.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, functions for formatting, with safe URL parsing and validation. No malicious activity or code obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** Functions are straightforward, with input validation and no side effects.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—utility functions, safe operations, no external system calls, no malicious behavior. Slight mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.1, but the overall conclusion remains benign.\n\n- **Assessment:** All functions are safe, mainly formatting and validation, with no network or system access.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, possibly due to cautious default or minor concern, but overall minimal)\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is purely utility functions for formatting, validation, and display purposes. No network, file, or command execution, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, the malware score should be **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard libraries. Obfuscation is not present; thus, **0**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The code is safe, with no security risks. The minimal \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in report 5 seems overly cautious. A more appropriate score would be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent in their assessment that this code is benign and purely utility-oriented. The slight variation in \"securityRisk\" is unnecessary given the functions' nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and straightforward. No evidence supports any security concern, malware, or obfuscation. The overall scores should reflect this benign nature.",
