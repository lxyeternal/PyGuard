  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable formatting of durations, byte sequences, hashes, IPFS URIs, integer sequences, and Wei units.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as bytes, strings, integers, and URIs; parsing URL components.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, external system interaction, or data leakage. It only processes and formats data for display.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes, strings, integers, URIs) flows through formatting functions, with no external data or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code patterns. No unsafe code such as injection or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of formatting and utility functions to humanize durations, hashes, IPFS URIs, integer sequences, and Wei amounts. It performs URL parsing, hex formatting, and sequence analysis with no external system calls or sensitive data handling. Functions like 'humanize_ipfs_uri' validate IPFS CIDv0 hashes, but do not perform any network activity or access secrets. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious code. The code is well-structured and intended for presentation purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of formatting and utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or data leakage vectors. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
