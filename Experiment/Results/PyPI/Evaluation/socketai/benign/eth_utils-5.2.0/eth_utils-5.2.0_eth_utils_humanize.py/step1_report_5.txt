{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing and formatting various data types such as seconds, bytes, hex strings, IPFS URIs, integer sequences, and wei values, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters in functions, such as bytes, strings, URIs, and integer sequences. It also imports modules for URL parsing and type definitions.",
  "sinks": "The code performs string formatting and parsing operations; it does not write to files, network, or execute commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting and parsing functions, with no external untrusted data handling or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code mainly processes data for display, with no evidence of malicious payloads or secret data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on data formatting, humanization, and parsing. It includes functions to convert seconds, bytes, hex strings, IPFS URIs, integer sequences, and wei units into more human-readable formats. All functions perform safe operations, such as string slicing, parsing, and iteration, with no indication of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The use of URL parsing and type checks appears standard and safe. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely utility functions for data formatting and parsing without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or contain malicious payloads. Overall security risk is minimal.",
