  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences with validation and display limits.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as bytes, strings, URIs, and integers; validation functions for IPFS CIDv0 hashes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks; functions perform only formatting, validation, and parsing.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and formatted; no external system calls or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for human-readable formatting and validation. It validates IPFS CIDv0 hashes, limits hash display length, and parses URIs safely. There are no external system calls, network operations, or data leaks. The functions are well-structured, using standard libraries, and do not contain obfuscation or malicious code. The validation steps are appropriate and do not introduce vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears overly cautious, as no vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data formatting and validation, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. The slight security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for consistency.",
