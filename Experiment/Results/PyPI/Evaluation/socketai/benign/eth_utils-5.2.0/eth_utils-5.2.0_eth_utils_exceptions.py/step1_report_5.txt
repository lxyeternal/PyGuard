  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors",
  "sources": "No external data sources read; class definition only",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow; class declaration with no instantiation or usage",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception with a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no data inputs, external calls, or complex logic. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are present. The class appears to be a standard pattern for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for handling validation errors with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
