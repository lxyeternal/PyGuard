  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review of the Original Snippet:**\n```python\nclass ValidationError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"\n    Raised when something does not pass a validation check.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n- The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from `Exception`.\n- It contains a descriptive docstring.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, input/output operations, or obfuscated elements.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a straightforward, benign class definition.\n- They note the absence of external data handling, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The confidence levels are all 1.0, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n- The malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and lack of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Scores and Logic:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n- The code serves as a standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n- Since the code is static and simple, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n- No evidence suggests any obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n5. **Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The code should be considered safe and non-malicious.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign Python class for a custom exception.\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided analysis and the code's simplicity.",
