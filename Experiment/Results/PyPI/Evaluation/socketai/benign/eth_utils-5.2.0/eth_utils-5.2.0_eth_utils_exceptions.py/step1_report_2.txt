  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'ValidationError' inheriting from Exception. It contains a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no functions, external data reads, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard class definition for use elsewhere in a project.",
