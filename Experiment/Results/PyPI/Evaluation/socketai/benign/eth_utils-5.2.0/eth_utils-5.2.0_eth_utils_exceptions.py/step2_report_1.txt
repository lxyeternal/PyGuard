  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content**:\n```python\nclass ValidationError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"\n    Raised when something does not pass a validation check.\n    \"\"\"\n```\nThis is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`. It includes a descriptive docstring but no additional logic, data, or behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n- The code itself is correct, syntactically valid, and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n- No dynamic behavior, data processing, input/output, or external dependencies are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports**:\n- All five reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify that the class is a simple, static definition with no data flow, external input, or output.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security issues are found.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 — correct, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0 — correct, no malicious behavior or indicators.\n- **Security Risk Score**: 0.0 — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n- **Confidence**: 1.0 — justified, as all evidence points to a safe, standard pattern.\n\n5. **Potential Adjustments**:\n- Since the code is so minimal and standard, no score adjustments are necessary.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n- The only potential concern might be if this class were used in a malicious context elsewhere, but as a static class definition, it alone poses no risk.\n- The absence of any code that could be exploited or obfuscated confirms the benign assessment.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0.0\n- **Risk score**: 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard, harmless class definition for a custom exception. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary. The scores reflect the benign nature of this snippet.\n\n**Note**: If future code involving this class were to introduce dynamic behavior or external data handling, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
