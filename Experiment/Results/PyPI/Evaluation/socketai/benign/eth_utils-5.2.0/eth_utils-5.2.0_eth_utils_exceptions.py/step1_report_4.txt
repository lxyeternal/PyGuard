  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a simple custom exception by inheriting from Exception with a descriptive docstring. No data handling, input, or suspicious constructs are present. It appears to be a standard class definition used for exception handling in validation contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class definition for validation errors with no malicious behavior detected.",
