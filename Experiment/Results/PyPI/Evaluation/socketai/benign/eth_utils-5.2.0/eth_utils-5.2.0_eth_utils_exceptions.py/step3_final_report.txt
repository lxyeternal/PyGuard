  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "Class definition; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception inheriting from Exception with a descriptive docstring. It contains no dynamic behavior, external dependencies, or obfuscation. All five reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence (1.0). The code is a standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python exception class with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and scores are consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or concern is necessary.",
