The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of the wheel file. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting very low risk in a controlled environment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility library for Ethereum ABI handling. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The cryptographic operations are typical and safe within this context. The code structure and regex usage are straightforward and align with best practices. Overall, the code is safe for use, with no malicious intent or obfuscation."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The static code is benign and well-structured, with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the potential for malicious behavior if external formatters or conditions are untrusted. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score should be set around 0.2 to 0.5 depending on trust assumptions. Given the context, a risk score of 0.2 is appropriate for general use, but if untrusted inputs are involved, it should be increased to reflect the potential for code execution."

The only issue is a probable typo in the version assignment line, which should be corrected for proper functionality. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1 due to the minor coding mistake, but it does not pose a security threat."
