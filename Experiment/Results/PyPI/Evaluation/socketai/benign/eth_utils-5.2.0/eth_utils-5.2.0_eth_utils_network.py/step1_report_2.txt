{
  "purpose": "This code loads Ethereum network configurations from a JSON file, creates network objects, and provides utility functions to retrieve network info based on chain ID.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from 'eth_networks.json' file located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks that lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading JSON file (source) into parsing and creating Network objects, then into dictionary lookups in utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard JSON loading and data processing. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code properly reads a JSON file, constructs data objects, and provides accessor functions with exception handling for invalid chain IDs. The JSON file path is constructed dynamically, which is safe. No unsafe eval, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing Ethereum network configurations. It performs no malicious actions and contains no security risks based on the provided code.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
