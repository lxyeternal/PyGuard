{
  "purpose": "Load and process Ethereum network configuration data from a JSON file, providing functions to access network info by chain ID.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON file (__json/eth_networks.json) from the filesystem, reading data from the JSON content.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe sinks are present; data is used internally to create Network objects and raise validation errors.",
  "flows": "JSON file content -> json.load() -> Network object creation -> stored in dictionaries for lookup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; code uses standard libraries and safe practices. No obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code loads network configuration data from a JSON file located relative to the script's directory. It then constructs Network objects from JSON entries, handling exceptions if 'chainId' is invalid. The data is stored in dictionaries for quick lookup. Functions provide network info or raise ValidationError if not found. No external network connections, no dynamic code execution, no malicious data handling, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with safe data handling practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code's purpose is to provide network data access; it appears benign and secure.",
