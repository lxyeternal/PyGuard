{
  "purpose": "This code loads Ethereum network configurations from a JSON file and provides utility functions to retrieve network information based on chain IDs.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a JSON file located in a directory relative to the script (__json/eth_networks.json).",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly sends or writes data to external sources or untrusted outputs. It raises exceptions, which are handled internally.",
  "flows": "JSON file data -> parsed into network objects -> stored in dictionaries for lookup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of os.path functions to locate files is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a JSON configuration file containing network data, converts entries into Network dataclasses, and stores them in dictionaries for quick lookup. The functions for retrieving network info by chain ID are straightforward and include exception handling for unrecognized IDs. The code uses standard libraries and no external or unsafe code. No malware indicators such as network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present. The only potential concern is the reliance on external JSON data, but this is typical for configuration files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration loader and lookup utility for Ethereum network data. It does not contain any malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, mainly related to trusting the integrity of the JSON file being loaded.",
