  "purpose": "Load Ethereum network configuration data from a JSON file, instantiate Network objects, and provide lookup functions by chain ID.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON file at a path relative to the script (__json/eth_networks.json). Accessing dictionary entries from loaded JSON data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent to external systems or network, and no untrusted data is executed or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "JSON data is loaded from file -> parsed into dicts -> used to create Network instances -> stored in dictionaries for lookup functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Exception handling for invalid chain IDs is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads network configuration data from an external JSON file, constructs data classes, and provides functions to retrieve network info by chain ID, raising ValidationError if not found. It uses standard libraries and practices, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or obfuscation. The JSON path is constructed dynamically but securely. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The exception handling is proper, and the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration loader with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reliance on external JSON data is typical for configuration files and does not pose a security threat. The scores assigned in the critical reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
