  "purpose": "Utility functions for address validation, normalization, and formatting in Ethereum-related contexts.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters of functions such as 'value', 'address', and 'left/right' in address validation and transformation functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions like 'to_hex', 'hexstr_if_str', 'decode_hex', and 'keccak' to process and convert address data; no data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation functions, conversion functions, and hashing to produce normalized, checksum, and canonical addresses; no external or untrusted data outputs are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code; the code performs standard address validation and formatting with cryptographic hashing, typical in Ethereum utilities. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for address validation, normalization, and checksum formatting. It relies on regex matching, type checks, and cryptographic hashing (keccak) to verify and transform addresses. There are no external data transmissions, network operations, or system modifications. The functions perform standard cryptographic and data validation tasks consistent with address handling libraries. The use of cryptographic hash functions like keccak is normal in address checksum calculations and does not introduce malicious behavior. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. All operations are standard for Ethereum address handling, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for Ethereum address validation, normalization, and checksum formatting. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data exfiltration, or suspicious functionality. It performs typical cryptographic and validation tasks safely and securely.",
