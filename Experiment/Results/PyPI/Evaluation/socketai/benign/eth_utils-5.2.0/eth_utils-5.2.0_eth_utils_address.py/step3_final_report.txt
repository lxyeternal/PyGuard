  "purpose": "Utility functions for Ethereum address validation, normalization, checksum creation, and comparison.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern matching for address format, cryptographic keccak hash for checksum, data transformations for normalization and conversion.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data (address strings or bytes) -> validation/normalization -> checksum calculation -> formatted address outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum address validation, normalization, and checksum generation using regex, cryptographic hashing, and straightforward data transformations. It does not execute external code, perform network operations, or handle secrets. The functions are clear, well-structured, and rely on trusted cryptographic procedures. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The regex pattern correctly matches Ethereum addresses, and the checksum logic follows standard Ethereum EIP-55 procedures. Overall, the code is a typical, secure utility module for address handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard Ethereum address utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The provided reports are accurate, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
