{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for validating, normalizing, and converting Ethereum addresses in various formats, including checksums and canonical forms.",
  "sources": "Functions receive inputs from parameters and use internal regex for address validation. No external data sources or input streams are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; the code performs data validation and transformation without writing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves input validation, normalization, and formatting of address data. No untrusted data flow to external systems or network operations is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are observed. The regex correctly matches Ethereum address formats. All operations are standard validation and conversion functions.",
  "analysis": "The code validates Ethereum addresses in different formats, converts between representations, and verifies checksum correctness. It uses regex for address pattern matching, avoids unsafe practices, and performs transformations without executing external code or network access. There are no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code snippets. Functions handle expected data types, raise appropriate errors, and use cryptographic hashing for checksum validation, which is standard and safe. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated segments or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs address validation, normalization, and checksum verification in a secure and standard manner. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It appears to be a standard utility module for Ethereum address handling.",
