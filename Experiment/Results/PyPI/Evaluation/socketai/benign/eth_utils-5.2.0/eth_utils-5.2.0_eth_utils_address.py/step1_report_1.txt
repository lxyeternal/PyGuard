  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling and validating Ethereum addresses in various formats, including conversion, normalization, and checksum verification.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'value', 'left', 'right', and 'address' in functions like is_hex_address, is_bytes, is_text, to_normalized_address, to_canonical_address, to_checksum_address.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not perform external network communication, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted data in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "Input data (addresses) flows through validation functions, normalization, and checksum generation, with no execution of untrusted code or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The regex for address validation is standard. Functions perform straightforward data validation and transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides address validation, normalization, and conversion functionalities for Ethereum addresses, employing standard cryptographic hashing and formatting techniques. The regex for address validation is correct for hexadecimal Ethereum addresses. Address transformations like checksum calculation follow standard procedures. No external network or untrusted command execution is present. The functions operate solely on input data, performing format validation and data transformations without side effects or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for Ethereum address handling without any malicious intent. It performs data validation, normalization, and formatting securely, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
