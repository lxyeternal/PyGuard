  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is just import statements and a version assignment from `importlib.metadata`. No suspicious activity, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- **Verdict:** Completely benign. No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the absence of data flows or sinks. The only note is a very slight security risk (0.1), possibly due to the version assignment.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity. The low risk score is justified, though the code itself is very benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—imports and version assignment, no malicious behavior. The report confirms the code is a typical utility module.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 fit well.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar, but notes a **coding mistake** in the line `__version__ = __version(\"eth-utils\")`. This suggests a typo or bug, not malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** No malware, but the mistake indicates a possible oversight. Still, no security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are acceptable; the slight risk accounts for the potential runtime error.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with a note that the `__version__` assignment might be a typo (`__version__ = __version(\"eth-utils\")`), which could cause runtime errors but is not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious activity; just a minor coding error.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree there is no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports due to the potential runtime error in the version assignment, but not indicative of security risk.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only noteworthy point is a probable typo in the version assignment line, which could cause runtime errors but does not pose a security threat.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (due to the potential typo causing runtime errors, but not a security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain risk is negligible. The code is safe, with a minor coding mistake that should be corrected but does not impact security.",
