  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The only issue is a probable typo in the version assignment line, which should be corrected for proper functionality. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1 due to the minor coding mistake, but it does not pose a security threat."
