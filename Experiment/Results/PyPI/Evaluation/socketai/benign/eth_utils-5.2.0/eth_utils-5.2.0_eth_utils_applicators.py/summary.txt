  "conclusion": "The static code is benign and well-structured, with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the potential for malicious behavior if external formatters or conditions are untrusted. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score should be set around 0.2 to 0.5 depending on trust assumptions. Given the context, a risk score of 0.2 is appropriate for general use, but if untrusted inputs are involved, it should be increased to reflect the potential for code execution."
