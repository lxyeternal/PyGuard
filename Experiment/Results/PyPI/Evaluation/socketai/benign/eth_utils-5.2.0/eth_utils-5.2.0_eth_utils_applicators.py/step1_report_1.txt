{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and arrays, including key remapping and conditional formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as lists, dictionaries, and callable conditions.",
  "sinks": "The functions yield transformed data or return formatted results; no direct sinks such as network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatter functions, with optional conditional logic or key remapping, resulting in transformed outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious strings are present. The use of warnings for deprecation is standard. No external network calls, file manipulations, or system modifications are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several functions to apply formatters to sequences, dictionaries, or individual items. It uses decorators for type annotations, and the logic is straightforward: applying functions to data structures with validation. The deprecation warning indicates planned future changes but is not malicious. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. The code appears to serve as a utility library for data transformation without any hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data formatting and transformation, with no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs safe operations with input validation and warnings for deprecated functions. No malware or security risks are identified.",
