  "purpose": "Utility functions for applying various formatting and transformation operations on lists, dictionaries, and sequences, including key mapping and conditional formatting.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, imported modules, and decorators used for type annotations and warnings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; the functions process data in-memory and yield results without external output.",
  "flows": "Input data is received via function parameters, processed through formatters and transformers, and yielded as output; no external data flow or network activity is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data transformation, including applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, applying formatters to sequences and dicts, and key mapping. It employs standard Python constructs, type annotations, and warning mechanisms. No untrusted data sources, network operations, or potential backdoors are present. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are detected. The deprecation warning is benign and related to API evolution. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for data formatting purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of data transformation utilities without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs expected formatting operations securely and transparently, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
