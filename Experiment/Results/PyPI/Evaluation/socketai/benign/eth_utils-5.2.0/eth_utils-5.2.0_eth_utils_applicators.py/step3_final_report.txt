  "purpose": "Utility functions for data formatting and transformation, including applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, applying formatters to sequences, dictionaries, arrays, and key mappings, as well as conditional and key-mapping transformations.",
  "sources": "Functions read input data from in-memory data structures such as lists and dictionaries; external data sources are not involved.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the execution of user-supplied formatter and condition callables, which could execute arbitrary code if maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (lists, dicts) through formatter functions, with external callables invoked during processing; no external network or file I/O occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external, user-supplied callables (formatters, conditions) introduces potential security risks; no obfuscation or malicious code is present in the static code.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions for data transformation, operating solely on in-memory data structures. No external network or file operations are performed. The functions accept callables for formatting, which could be malicious if supplied by untrusted sources, posing a security risk. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The deprecation warning is standard and not suspicious. The main concern is the potential execution of arbitrary code via user-provided formatters or conditions, which is a common pattern in flexible utility libraries but warrants caution when used with untrusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The static code is benign and well-structured, with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the potential for malicious behavior if external formatters or conditions are untrusted. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score should be set around 0.2 to 0.5 depending on trust assumptions. Given the context, a risk score of 0.2 is appropriate for general use, but if untrusted inputs are involved, it should be increased to reflect the potential for code execution.",
