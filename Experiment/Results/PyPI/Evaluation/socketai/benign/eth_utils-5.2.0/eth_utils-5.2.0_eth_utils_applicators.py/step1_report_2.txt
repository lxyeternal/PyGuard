{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for applying formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and lists, primarily for data processing or validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as lists, dictionaries, and callables, as well as imported modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write data to external sources, invoke network operations, or perform file I/O. They mainly perform in-memory data transformations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatter functions and yield or return transformed data; no external untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hard-coded secrets are present. Warnings about deprecation are standard and not malicious. The functions rely on decorators and external modules, but these are not suspicious by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several data transformation utilities, such as applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, and applying formatters conditionally or to dictionaries. All operations are in-memory and do not include any network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration logic. The use of warnings for deprecated functions is standard practice. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. No suspicious external calls, nor does the code handle untrusted user input in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities like code injection or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of benign utility functions for data formatting and transformation, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It operates solely within memory, with no network or file system interactions that could be exploited.",
