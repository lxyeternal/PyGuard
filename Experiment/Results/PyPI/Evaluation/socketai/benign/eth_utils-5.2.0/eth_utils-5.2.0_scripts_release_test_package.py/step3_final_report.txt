{
  "purpose": "Create a virtual environment, update pip/setuptools, locate a wheel in 'dist/', install it into the environment, and prompt the user for confirmation.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths for creating venv and locating wheel; subprocess calls for pip installation; user input for manual pause.",
  "sinks": "Installation of the wheel into the environment; no data leaks or external data flows; user input for flow control.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths used in subprocess commands; user input to pause script; no external network or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; relies on controlled filesystem paths; no unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for creating a virtual environment, updating pip, locating a wheel file in 'dist/', and installing it. It uses subprocess to run pip commands with controlled paths, and prompts the user for manual confirmation. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code patterns are present. The only operational concern is the trustworthiness of the wheel file sourced from the local directory, which is standard for testing but could pose a risk if compromised. Overall, the code performs typical package testing tasks with no inherent security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It performs standard environment setup and package installation. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of the wheel file. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting very low risk in a controlled environment.",
