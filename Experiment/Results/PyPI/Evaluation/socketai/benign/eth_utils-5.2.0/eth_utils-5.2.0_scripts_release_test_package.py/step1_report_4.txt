{
  "purpose": "The code creates a virtual environment, finds a wheel file in the 'dist' directory, installs it into the virtual environment, and prompts the user to manually verify installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the local filesystem to find wheel files, reads user input via 'input()' function.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess to run pip commands, which execute installation processes; also outputs to console.",
  "flows": "Filesystem access to locate wheel files -> subprocess runs pip install with wheel path -> user input pause to confirm completion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'input()' for pausing may be considered unconventional in automated scripts but is not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected; no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard environment setup and package installation tasks. It dynamically locates wheel files and installs them via subprocess calls to pip within a created virtual environment. No suspicious data exfiltration, network connections to unknown domains, or malicious commands are present. The use of 'input()' to pause execution is typical for manual testing or confirmation, not malicious. All subprocess commands rely on the local environment and do not execute untrusted code or data. Overall, the code appears safe with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for creating virtual environments, locating wheel files, and installing packages. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified. It appears to be a benign testing or deployment helper script.",
