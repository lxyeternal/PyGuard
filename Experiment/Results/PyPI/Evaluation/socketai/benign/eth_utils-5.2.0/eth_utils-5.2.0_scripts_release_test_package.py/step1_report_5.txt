{
  "purpose": "The code creates a virtual environment, finds a wheel file in the 'dist' directory, installs it into the virtual environment, and prompts the user to verify installation completion.",
  "sources": "User input via 'input()' function, filesystem access (Path.glob), subprocess calls to pip, and reading wheel files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'pip install', reading wheel files, and printing messages; user input via 'input()'.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths are used to locate wheel files; subprocess runs install commands; user input pauses execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'input()' in a script that could be run unattended; no hardcoded credentials or secret data; subprocess commands are standard but rely on user environment.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard environment setup and package installation tasks. The subprocess commands invoke pip to install dependencies, which is typical. The code searches for wheel files and installs them, then prompts the user to confirm completion. No suspicious code, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The use of 'input()' for pausing is normal for manual testing but could be misused if integrated into an automated system. Overall, the code appears to be a benign testing utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate environment setup and package installation functions with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It relies on standard libraries and subprocess calls, with no hidden or suspicious code. The use of 'input()' is typical for manual testing and does not pose a security risk in this context.",
