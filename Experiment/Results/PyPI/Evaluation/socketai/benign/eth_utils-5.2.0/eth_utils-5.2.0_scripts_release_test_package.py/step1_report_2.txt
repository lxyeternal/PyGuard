{
  "purpose": "The script automates the creation of a Python virtual environment, installs a package wheel into it, and provides instructions for manual activation, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the filesystem (project directory, wheel files) and user input from the console (via input() call).",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run() to execute pip commands, which execute external processes for package installation. The input() function reads user input.",
  "flows": "Filesystem paths are used as input sources. The subprocess calls execute pip commands with paths as arguments, which are executed in shell context. User input from 'input()' is a flow control point.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets detected. The code calls external processes to install packages but does not appear to invoke malicious commands or connect to external domains. The input() call is for user synchronization, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script creates virtual environments and installs wheel files, which is typical for testing package installation. It searches for wheel files in the 'dist' directory and installs them into the created venv. The subprocess.run() calls execute pip commands, which is standard. The only potential concern is the use of subprocess with external commands, but it appears controlled and intended for package management. The input() call is used for user synchronization, not malicious activity. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard operations for creating virtual environments and installing Python packages. There are no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It is a typical testing script with no malicious intent.",
