{
  "purpose": "This script creates a virtual environment, finds a wheel file in the 'dist' directory, and installs it into the virtual environment for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input source is the current directory '.' when finding the wheel file via 'find_wheel' function.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to pip installation and user input prompt are potential sinks where untrusted data could influence behavior.",
  "flows": "Wheel file path obtained from the current directory flows into the installation subprocess command. User input flows into program continuation, but does not influence security-related operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Use of subprocess without sanitization is standard for this context, given controlled inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a virtual environment, updates pip and setuptools, searches for a wheel file in the 'dist' folder, and installs it. The process appears straightforward and intended for testing. The subprocess calls execute pip commands with controlled parameters. The 'find_wheel' function expects exactly one wheel file; if multiple or none, it raises an exception. User prompt simply pauses the script until user confirms. No external data sources, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed. No obfuscation or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard virtual environment setup and package installation for testing purposes. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks identified. It appears safe with respect to supply chain security.",
