{
  "purpose": "This script creates a virtual environment, finds a wheel file in the 'dist' directory, installs the wheel into the virtual environment, and prompts the user to verify the installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory to find wheel files, user input from the console, and the filesystem to create directories and locate files.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess calls execute pip commands which could be misused if the wheel path is manipulated. User input is accepted but only for pausing the script, not used maliciously.",
  "flows": "The code finds wheel files, installs them into a created venv, and waits for user confirmation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious commands, or malicious code. The subprocess commands are standard for installing packages, and user input is used solely for flow control.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard environment setup and package installation tasks, with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic. The subprocess calls for pip are properly constructed with specific paths, reducing risk of command injection. No external data sources or untrusted inputs influence critical operations beyond filesystem and user confirmation. The script does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications beyond package installation. The overall behavior is typical for a testing script, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign testing utility for installing a wheel into a virtual environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It is a straightforward, safe script intended for local testing of Python packages.",
