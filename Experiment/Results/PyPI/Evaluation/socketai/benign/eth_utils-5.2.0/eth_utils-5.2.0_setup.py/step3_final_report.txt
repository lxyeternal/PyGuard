  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for the 'eth-utils' package, defining dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading static README.md file, defining dependencies, and static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads a static README.md, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, external network activity, or embedded secrets are present. The code is static, readable, and follows standard practices, indicating no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals point to a safe and well-structured configuration.",
