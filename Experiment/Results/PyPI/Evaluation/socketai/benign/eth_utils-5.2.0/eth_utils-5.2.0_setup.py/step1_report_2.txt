{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'eth-utils' Python package, defining dependencies, package metadata, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; hardcoded strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external data handling or insecure data processing identified.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content flows into the 'long_description' variable used in package setup; static data flows into setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools, loading static data, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. No user inputs, network operations, or executable code are present beyond standard setup procedures. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected. The code follows common patterns for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as intended for package configuration.",
