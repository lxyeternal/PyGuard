  "purpose": "Utility functions for Ethereum ABI processing, including signature generation, filtering, and input normalization.",
  "sources": "ABI definitions, cryptographic hash functions (keccak), regex for tuple parsing.",
  "sinks": "Hash functions used for signatures and event topics; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (ABI components) flows into hash functions for signature and topic derivation; no external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; regex straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard Ethereum ABI utilities, including signature creation, filtering by type or name, and input normalization. It uses cryptographic hashing (keccak) for signatures and event topics, which is standard in Ethereum tooling. Regex is used for tuple type parsing, aligning with ABI specifications. No external data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions are well-structured, with input validation and no suspicious patterns. The cryptographic functions are benign in this context, serving as signature derivation tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility library for Ethereum ABI handling. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The cryptographic operations are typical and safe within this context. The code structure and regex usage are straightforward and align with best practices. Overall, the code is safe for use, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
