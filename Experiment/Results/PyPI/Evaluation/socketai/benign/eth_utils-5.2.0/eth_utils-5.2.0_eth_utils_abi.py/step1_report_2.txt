{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for processing and analyzing Ethereum smart contract ABI definitions, including signature generation, filtering, normalization, and encoding.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from ABI definitions (dictionaries and lists), and function parameters such as function signatures and ABI elements.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent over the network, no system commands are executed, and no file or environment variable access is performed. No external connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "The code transforms ABI data into signatures, selectors, and filters; no untrusted data flows directly into system or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The regular expressions and logic are standard for ABI handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides parsing, formatting, and filtering functions for Ethereum ABI data structures. It uses standard Python libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. No external network or system commands are invoked, and no hidden data exfiltration or sabotage mechanisms are present. All functions are deterministic and focused on data formatting or filtering. The use of keccak for signature hashing is standard in Ethereum tooling. There are no signs of malicious obfuscation, credential handling, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical utility library for Ethereum ABI processing. It performs data validation, filtering, and encoding with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any harmful operations such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration.",
