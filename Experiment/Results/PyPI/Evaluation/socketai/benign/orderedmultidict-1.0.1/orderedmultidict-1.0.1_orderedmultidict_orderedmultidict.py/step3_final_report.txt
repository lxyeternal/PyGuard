  "purpose": "Implementation of an ordered multivalue dictionary that maintains insertion order and allows multiple values per key, providing various methods for data manipulation and retrieval.",
  "sources": "Methods like load(), update(), add(), setlist(), getlist(), and iteration over internal data structures (_items, _map). No external data sources or system inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "Data is primarily manipulated internally; no external network, file, or system calls are present. String representations (__str__, __repr__) expose internal data but are standard for debugging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal structures via methods like add(), setlist(), update(), and load(). These modify _items and _map, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious anomalies detected. Use of dynamic attribute detection (callable_attr) is benign. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, well-structured implementation of an ordered multivalue dictionary. It relies on standard libraries and a local linked list module (itemlist). No external communication, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. Methods like load(), update(), add(), setlist() manipulate internal data safely. No signs of code injection, data leaks, or sabotage are detected. The code's purpose is data management, with no external system interaction or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex data structure implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It functions as intended for data storage and retrieval, with no security concerns or malicious signals. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
