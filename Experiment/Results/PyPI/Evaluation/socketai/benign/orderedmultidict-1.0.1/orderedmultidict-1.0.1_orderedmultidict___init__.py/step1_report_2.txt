  "purpose": "Defines an ordered multivalue dictionary module, imports necessary functions, and dynamically loads version information from a separate file.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__version__.py' file for version info.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing code read from '__version__.py'.",
  "flows": "File read -> exec() execution of file contents -> update of 'meta' dictionary -> update of global namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from a file; potential risk if '__version__.py' contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and functions, then reads a version file '__version__.py' and executes its content dynamically via exec(). This approach can be dangerous if the content of '__version__.py' is maliciously modified, as exec() will run arbitrary code. The rest of the code appears standard for package setup, with no other suspicious behavior or hardcoded credentials. The exec() call is the main point of concern regarding supply chain security, as it executes code from an external file without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of exec() to execute code from '__version__.py'. If this file is tampered with, it could execute malicious code. However, under normal circumstances, '__version__.py' should only contain version information. The code's design is typical for Python packages but relies on the integrity of '__version__.py'.",
