  "sinks": "Executes the content of __version__.py, which could contain arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Reading __version__.py content with open -> executing content with exec -> updating globals with version info.",
  "anomalies": "Using exec() to run code from a version file is unusual and potentially dangerous if the file content is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and then dynamically loads version information by executing the contents of __version__.py. The use of exec() on a file that is part of the package is risky because if the __version__.py file is tampered with, malicious code could be executed. This pattern is sometimes used for dynamic imports but is considered unsafe and can be exploited if an attacker can modify __version__.py. No other suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this fragment. The rest of the code appears to be straightforward module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The main concern is the use of exec() to evaluate the contents of __version__.py, which could lead to code execution if that file is maliciously altered. This pattern is risky but not inherently malicious. No other malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. Overall security risk is moderate due to exec() usage.",
