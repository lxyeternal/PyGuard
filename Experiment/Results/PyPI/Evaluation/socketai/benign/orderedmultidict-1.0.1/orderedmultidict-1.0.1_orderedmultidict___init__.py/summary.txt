  "conclusion": "The code is standard for Python packages, with no malicious activity detected. The main security concern is the use of exec() on a local file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.3-0.4) is justified given the pattern. Ensuring the integrity of '__version__.py' or using safer loading methods can mitigate this risk."
