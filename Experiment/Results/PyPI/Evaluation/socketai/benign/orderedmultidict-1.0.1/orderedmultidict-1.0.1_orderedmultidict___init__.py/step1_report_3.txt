  "purpose": "Define an ordered multivalue dictionary class and load version metadata dynamically from a separate __version__.py file.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__.py file in the same directory to execute its content.",
  "sinks": "exec() call on the contents of __version__.py, which could execute arbitrary code from that file.",
  "flows": "Open __version__.py -> exec() -> execution of its content -> updating globals with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from a file, which could be malicious if the __version__.py file is compromised or maliciously altered.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions and variables, and dynamically loads version information from __version__.py using exec(). While this is a common pattern to load metadata, the use of exec() introduces a security risk if the __version__.py file is tampered with. The code does not contain other suspicious behaviors such as network access, credential handling, or data leaks. No obfuscated code or malicious logic beyond the exec() pattern is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The main concern is the use of exec() to run potentially untrusted code from __version__.py. If the __version__.py file is secure and from a trusted source, the risk is minimal. However, this pattern could be exploited if an attacker manages to modify __version__.py. Overall, the code appears straightforward with a single security consideration.",
