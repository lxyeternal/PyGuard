  "purpose": "The code defines an ordered multivalue dictionary and dynamically loads version information by reading and executing the '__version__.py' file.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__version__.py' file from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the content of '__version__.py' via exec().",
  "flows": "Reading '__version__.py' -> executing its content with exec() -> updating global variables with version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from a local file, which could be risky if the file is tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, reads a local version file, executes its content with exec(), and updates globals. The primary security concern is the use of exec() on a local file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No network activity, user input handling, or malicious payloads are present. The use of exec() is a common pattern but introduces potential risks if the version file is not secured. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score varies between 0.2 and 0.5 across reports, reflecting the inherent risk of executing external code, with a balanced estimate around 0.3-0.4 if the version file is trusted. To improve security, replacing exec() with safer alternatives like static parsing or importlib-based loading is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for Python packages, with no malicious activity detected. The main security concern is the use of exec() on a local file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.3-0.4) is justified given the pattern. Ensuring the integrity of '__version__.py' or using safer loading methods can mitigate this risk.",
