  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'orderedmultidict' Python package, including title, version, license, author, contact, description, and URL.",
  "sources": "Metadata variable assignments (__title__, __version__, __license__, __author__, __contact__, __description__, __url__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute or process untrusted data; purely metadata assignment",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static metadata assignments",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functional code, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution; purely descriptive metadata",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of metadata variable declarations and comments about the package. There are no data inputs, processing, or execution logic present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be the initial part of a package module, likely to be followed by actual implementation elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static metadata and comments, with no executable or data-processing logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this fragment.",
