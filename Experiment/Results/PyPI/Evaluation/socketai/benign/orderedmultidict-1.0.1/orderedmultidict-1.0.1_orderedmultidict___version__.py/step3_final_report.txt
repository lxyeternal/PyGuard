  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations for __title__, __version__, __license__, __author__, __contact__, __description__, and __url__.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only static variable assignments and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, input/output, or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static variables do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward metadata with no dynamic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no functions, input handling, network calls, or executable logic. The code is purely descriptive, typical for a __init__.py or metadata module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
