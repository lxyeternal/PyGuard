  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'orderedmultidict' Python package, including title, version, license, author, contact, description, and URL.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow endpoints present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths as the code only sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard package metadata with no suspicious or unusual elements. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata variables defining package information, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. It appears to be part of a package's __init__.py or setup module. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as package metadata declaration. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
