  "purpose": "Implementation of an ordered multi-value dictionary using a doubly linked list of nodes.",
  "sources": "Initialization of items list, appending items, and methods iterating over the list (e.g., append, __init__, __iter__).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily manages internal data structures without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Items added via append() flow through to internal list iteration methods. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a standard data structure implementation with no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for an ordered multi-value dictionary built with a doubly linked list. It handles node creation, removal, iteration, and reversal, all within standard data structure paradigms. There are no evident malicious behaviors, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code features. It is a typical implementation of an internal data container, with no network activity, no data exfiltration, and no malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a doubly linked list to support an ordered multi-value dictionary. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module. It is a benign data structure implementation.",
