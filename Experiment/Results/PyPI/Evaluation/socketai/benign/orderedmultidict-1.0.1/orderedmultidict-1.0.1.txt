      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is standard for Python packages, with no malicious activity detected. The main security concern is the use of exec() on a local file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.3-0.4) is justified given the pattern. Ensuring the integrity of '__version__.py' or using safer loading methods can mitigate this risk."

It functions as intended for data storage and retrieval, with no security concerns or malicious signals. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate."
