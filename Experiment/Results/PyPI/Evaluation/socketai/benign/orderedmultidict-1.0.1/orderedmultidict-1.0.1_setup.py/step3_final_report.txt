{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'orderedmultidict' Python package, handling version retrieval, testing, and publishing processes.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(); executes system commands for build, test, and upload via os.system().",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls for 'python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel', 'twine upload', and test discovery; exec() for loading version info.",
  "flows": "Version info loaded with exec() -> used in build/upload commands; test suite discovered and run via os.system() commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could execute malicious code if the version file is compromised; use of os.system() instead of subprocess for shell commands.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, with the main security concern being the use of exec() to load version data, which could be risky if the file is malicious. The os.system() calls are typical but could be exploited if environment variables or files are maliciously altered. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and common for such scripts, with scores reflecting minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of exec() for version loading, which should be managed carefully. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
