  "purpose": "String similarity metrics and testing functions for string comparison validation.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to functions, internal variables during computation.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and print statements for debugging; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through comparison functions, with internal metrics calculations and assertions verifying correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; assertions are standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs string similarity calculations using imported modules, with internal validation via assertions and debugging prints. No external system interactions, network calls, or data leaks are present. The logic is straightforward, and the code relies on external libraries for core algorithms. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are evident. Assertions ensure correctness, and no suspicious control flow exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string similarity testing suite with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The imported modules are external dependencies but do not indicate malicious intent based on this code snippet. The security and malware scores are appropriately set to 0.",
