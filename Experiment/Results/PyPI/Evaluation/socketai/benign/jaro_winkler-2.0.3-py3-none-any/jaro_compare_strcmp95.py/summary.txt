  "conclusion": "The script is a benign testing utility designed for validation purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external binary, which is outside the code's scope. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and a low security risk primarily due to external binary execution."
