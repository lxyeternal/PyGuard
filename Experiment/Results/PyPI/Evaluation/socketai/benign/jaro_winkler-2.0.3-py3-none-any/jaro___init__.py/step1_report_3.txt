{
  "purpose": "Provides wrapper functions for calculating string similarity metrics (Jaro, Jaro-Winkler, and a custom metric), and a function to create typo tables, likely for fuzziness or typo tolerance in string comparison.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules 'jaro' and 'typo_tables'; no external data input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network connections, or data exfiltration points are present; no output or data leak mechanisms observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are apparent, as the code only defines and wraps functions without executing any untrusted input or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code at the end suggests possible attempts to assign or modify module attributes dynamically, but these are commented out and do not execute. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines wrapper functions around imported 'jaro' metrics and a typo table creation function. It includes descriptive comments and does not process external inputs or execute untrusted code. The commented section hints at dynamic attribute assignment but is inactive. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware mechanisms are detected. The functions seem intended for string similarity computation within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an interface to string similarity metrics with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any external data transmission or sensitive operations.",
