{
  "purpose": "Wrapper functions around 'jaro' and 'typo_tables' modules for string similarity metrics and typo table creation.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'jaro' and 'typo_tables'. No external data sources or input handling.",
  "sinks": "Internal function calls; no external data, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Function calls to imported modules; no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code related to dynamic module manipulation, but inactive and non-executing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of benign wrapper functions with no malicious or obfuscated code. The inactive commented code suggests prior or potential dynamic modifications but does not execute. No network, data exfiltration, or secret handling is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature, considering the commented-out code as a minor, inactive concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility for string similarity calculations with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The inactive commented code does not impact security. The existing scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
