{
  "purpose": "Provides wrapper functions for Jaro-Winkler string similarity metrics and creates typo tables for string comparison.",
  "sources": "Imports from .jaro and .typo_tables modules; calls functions within these modules.",
  "sinks": "None observed; functions are simple wrappers calling imported functions without executing untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to imported functions; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources observed.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code referencing sys.modules and creation of typo tables; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines wrapper functions around functions imported from local modules (.jaro and .typo_tables). There is no dynamic code execution, no network communication, and no use of untrusted input within this fragment. The commented-out code suggests some intent to modify module attributes or dynamically register functions, but as it's commented out, it does not execute. Overall, the code appears to be standard wrapper functions for string similarity metrics with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a wrapper for string similarity functions and typo table creation. No malicious activity or supply chain risks are evident from this fragment.",
