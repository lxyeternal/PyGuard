{
  "purpose": "The code creates a typographical similarity table for characters, used potentially for fuzzy string matching or typo correction, and prints this table.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present; the code operates on hardcoded data and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, file writes, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist; the functions operate purely on internal data structures without external data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are identified. The code is straightforward and well-structured, mainly for creating and displaying a character similarity table.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a list of character pairs representing typographical similarities. It includes functions to create a symmetric typo table (dictionary of dictionaries) assigning a 'score' to each pair, and a function to print this table in a formatted manner. The main block executes the print function for the pre-defined table. There are no external inputs, no network communications, and no malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks present. The logic is static, intended for typo similarity mapping.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for creating and displaying a typo similarity table. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or malicious code. It functions solely as a character similarity utility, with no external dependencies or suspicious behaviors.",
