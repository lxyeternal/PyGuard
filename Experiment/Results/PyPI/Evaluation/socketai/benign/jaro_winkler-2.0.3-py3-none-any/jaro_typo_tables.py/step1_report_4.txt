{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to create and display a typo similarity table for characters, potentially used for string comparison or fuzzy matching.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded data (__sp_table) and initializes it with a predefined list of character pairs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involve untrusted data or external systems; the code only outputs the typo table to stdout.",
  "flows": "The creation of the typo table from static data flows into the print function, which outputs the table.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code solely creates a symmetrical typo similarity table from a fixed list of character pairs and prints it. The functions are well-defined and do not process untrusted input or perform network operations. There are no obfuscation techniques, hidden code, or malicious logic. It appears to be a utility for visualizing or defining typo similarities, likely for string matching purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely a utility for creating and displaying a typo similarity table. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe for use.",
