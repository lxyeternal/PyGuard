{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and displays a typographical similarity table used for string comparison algorithms like Jaro-Winkler.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded typographical character pairs defined in the __sp_table variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the predefined __sp_table to the creation of the typo_table dictionary, then to printing the table.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and only creates a data structure and displays it.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to generate a symmetrical typo similarity table based on predefined character pairs, then prints it. The data is static and hardcoded, with no user input, external data, or network activity. No obfuscation, malicious payload, or suspicious logic is observed. The functions are well-documented and serve a benign purpose related to string similarity calculations. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for creating and displaying a typo similarity table, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
