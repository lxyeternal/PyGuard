{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to create and display a typographical similarity table between characters, primarily for use in fuzzy string matching or typo correction algorithms.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input mechanisms are used; the code uses a predefined list (__sp_table) for generating the typo table.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output other than printing the typo table. There are no sinks involved in data leaks or sensitive information transfer.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves creating a typo similarity table from a hardcoded list, then printing it. No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code is straightforward and serves a specific utility function without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to generate a symmetrical typo similarity table from a static list of character pairs. It then prints this table when run as a standalone script. There are no input prompts, network communications, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The use of hardcoded data is benign in this context. The code does not perform any system modifications, data exfiltration, or dangerous operations. Overall, the code appears to be a utility for creating typo tables, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that creates and displays a character similarity table for typo correction purposes. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks evident. It is safe for use.",
