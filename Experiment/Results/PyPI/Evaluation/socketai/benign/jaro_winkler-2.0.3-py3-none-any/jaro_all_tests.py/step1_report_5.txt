{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to string comparison algorithms and executes their test functions, likely for validation purposes within a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: compare_strcmp95, compare_jaro, jaro_tests",
  "sinks": "Execution of test functions: compare_strcmp95.test(), compare_jaro.test(), jaro_tests.test()",
  "flows": "Imported modules are invoked directly; data flow is limited to internal test function calls within the package",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; straightforward test function calls",
  "analysis": "The code imports three local modules related to string comparison and runs their test functions immediately. No external input handling, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The functions appear to be internal tests for the modules, not related to data exfiltration or system compromise. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard module imports and runs internal test functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be a benign testing routine within a package.",
