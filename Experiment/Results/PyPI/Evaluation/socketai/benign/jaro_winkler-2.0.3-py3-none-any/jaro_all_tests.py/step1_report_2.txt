{
  "purpose": "The code imports three modules related to string comparison and testing functions, then executes test functions from each module.",
  "sources": "Imports modules within the same package; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; no untrusted data handling or external communications occur.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module imports to calling test functions within each imported module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports three local modules: compare_strcmp95, compare_jaro, and jaro_tests. It then calls the test() function in each module. There is no evidence of external data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a testing or validation process for string comparison functions, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple imports and test executions without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign testing script.",
