{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the parse_variables function, validating its behavior with various input strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided in the parametrize decorator for test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or system effects; test assertions are contained within the testing framework.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into the parse_variables function, and the results are compared to expected outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard pytest and does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and a parsing module, then defines parameterized test cases to validate parsing logic. It verifies how variable placeholders and literals are parsed from strings. There are no signs of code injection, malicious data handling, or secret extraction. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test setup for parsing logic, with no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code execution pathways.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for parsing functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely tests input parsing logic without involving external systems or sensitive data.",
