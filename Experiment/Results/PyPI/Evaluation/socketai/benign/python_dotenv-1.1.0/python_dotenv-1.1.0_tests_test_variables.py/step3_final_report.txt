  "purpose": "Test suite for parse_variables function, verifying correct parsing of variable placeholders and literals in strings.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to parse_variables, containing variable patterns like ${a}, ${a:-b}, and literals.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data beyond static test inputs, nor does it perform external data operations.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into parse_variables, which outputs sequences of Literal and Variable objects; no external or untrusted data flow beyond test data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with static test cases, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest test suite that checks parsing of variable patterns in strings. It uses static, safe inputs, with no external dependencies or malicious logic. The tests confirm that parse_variables correctly identifies literals and variables. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is well-structured, simple, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for string parsing, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence and reports support this assessment.",
