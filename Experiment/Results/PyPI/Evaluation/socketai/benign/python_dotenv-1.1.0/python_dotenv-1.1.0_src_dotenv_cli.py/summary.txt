  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured environment variable management CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is the execution of arbitrary commands with user input, which is an inherent feature of such tools but should be used cautiously. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
