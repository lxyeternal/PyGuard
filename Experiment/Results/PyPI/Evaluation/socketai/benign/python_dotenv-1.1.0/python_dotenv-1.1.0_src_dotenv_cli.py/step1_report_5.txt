  "purpose": "A command-line tool to manage environment variables stored in a .env file, supporting listing, setting, getting, unsetting, and running commands with env variables.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user command-line arguments, the .env file (read via stream_file), environment variables (os.environ), and the command line command passed to run_command.",
  "sinks": "The run_command function executes arbitrary commands via os.execvpe, which can run any external process. File operations such as opening and reading the .env file. Output via click.echo is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from command-line args and the .env file into the environment for command execution, with user-controlled commands in run(). The dotenv_values function reads .env file content, and run_command executes the command with environment variables merged from the current env and .env file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code uses standard libraries and well-defined patterns. No obfuscation or obfuscated code detected. The run() function allows arbitrary command execution, but this is expected for a CLI tool designed to run commands with env vars.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads from user inputs (CLI args, environment variables, and files). It securely reads and writes environment variables, handles errors gracefully, and executes commands with controlled environment variables. The run_command function could execute any command, but this aligns with the intended functionality of a CLI tool for environment management. No malicious code or backdoors are present. The import statements and code structure show standard design, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate environment management CLI tool with no indication of malicious intent. It correctly handles file I/O, command execution, and CLI options without suspicious patterns. The only potential risk is that the run() command can execute arbitrary commands, but this is the intended feature of such a tool. Overall, it appears safe for use.",
