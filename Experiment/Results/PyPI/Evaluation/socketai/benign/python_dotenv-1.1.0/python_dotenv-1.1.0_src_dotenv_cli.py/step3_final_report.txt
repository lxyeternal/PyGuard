  "purpose": "A CLI utility for managing environment variables via a .env file, allowing listing, setting, getting, unsetting, and executing commands with these variables.",
  "sources": "File I/O for reading/writing the .env file, environment variables, user input via CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "Command execution through os.execvpe(), output to stdout/stderr, file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from files and user commands flow into environment variable handling functions and potentially into os.execvpe() for command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.execvpe() to run arbitrary commands with user-controlled input, which can be risky if inputs are malicious, but this is expected for such a utility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard environment variable management CLI tool. It correctly handles file operations, environment variables, and command execution. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is executing arbitrary commands via os.execvpe(), which is inherent to the tool's purpose. Error handling is appropriate, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious payloads. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The risk score is approximately 0.2, considering the potential misuse if untrusted input is provided to the run command, which is a known and accepted risk for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured environment variable management CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security concern is the execution of arbitrary commands with user input, which is an inherent feature of such tools but should be used cautiously. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
