  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for version declaration, with no unusual features or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the variable __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no input sources, external data reads, or suspicious code structures. The code does not perform any operations, network activity, or data manipulation. It appears as boilerplate version information typically found in Python modules.",
