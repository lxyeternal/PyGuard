  "sources": "None; static assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal and standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with confidence scores of 1.0, and assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and clarity justify these scores. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary.",
