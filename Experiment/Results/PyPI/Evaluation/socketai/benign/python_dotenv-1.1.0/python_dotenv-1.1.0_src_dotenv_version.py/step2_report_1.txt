  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code in question.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\nThe code is:\n```python\n__version__ = \"1.1.0\"\n```\nThis is a simple assignment of a string to a variable named `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, function calls, or dynamic behaviors. It is a standard pattern used in Python packages to specify version info.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- **Issue Confirmation:** No issues are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows common conventions.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** None. The code does not perform any operations beyond assigning a string.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report:**\n- All reports agree that this is a benign, standard version declaration.\n- They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no sources or sinks, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence scores are all 1.0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- Obfuscation and malware scores are all 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Evaluation of Scores:**\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Assumptions:**\n- No flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n- The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No need to adjust scores.\n\n6. **Overall Justification:**\n- The code is standard boilerplate for versioning.\n- No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n- The assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward version string assignment with no security concerns. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary. The scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and standard usage.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm the scores as is.  \n- No further action needed.",
