{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the entry point for a CLI application, importing and executing the 'cli' function from the local module when run as the main program.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import (.cli) and the execution trigger (__name__ == '__main__')",
  "sinks": "The 'cli()' function, which may process untrusted input or perform actions based on user commands",
  "flows": "From the import of 'cli' to its execution when the script runs as main",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI entry point, importing 'cli' and executing it if run directly. No data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The security depends on the implementation of 'cli()', which is outside this snippet. The code itself shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk score is also 0, reflecting the benign nature of this minimal code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The overall security posture depends on the implementation of 'cli()', but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
