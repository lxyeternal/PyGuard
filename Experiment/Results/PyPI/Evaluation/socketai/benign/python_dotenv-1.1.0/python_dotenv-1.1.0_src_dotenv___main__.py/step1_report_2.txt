{
  "purpose": "Entry point for CLI, enabling execution of the dotenv package or module via Python.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'cli' function or object from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data outputs, network calls, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: if executed as main, it calls 'cli()' from the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures. The code is minimal and standard for a CLI entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python script serving as an entry point for a command-line interface, importing 'cli' from a local module and executing it if run directly. There are no data inputs, network operations, or other potentially malicious activities present. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a CLI application and does not raise any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a CLI entry point, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
