  "purpose": "Entry point for CLI, enabling execution with `python -m dotenv`",
  "sources": "Import statement for the `cli` function from the local module `.cli`",
  "sinks": "Execution of `cli()` when the script is run directly",
  "flows": "Import of `.cli` -> calling `cli()` if script is main module",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; minimal code structure, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI function from a local module and executes it if run as the main program. The structure is standard for Python CLI entry points. No suspicious patterns, no data leaks, nor malicious actions observed. The simplicity suggests it’s a typical CLI launcher without embedded malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply delegates execution to an imported CLI handler.",
