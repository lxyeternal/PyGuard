  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward utility module for dotenv environment management and shell command string generation.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- The core function, `get_cli_string`, constructs command strings based on parameters but does not execute them.\n- The code imports functions from local modules (.main, .ipython), which are assumed to be standard for environment handling.\n- The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.2), and malware scores are consistently 0.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating the reviewers agree on benign intent.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not execute or run commands; it only constructs and returns command strings.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is evident.\n- The functions imported are typical for dotenv and IPython extension handling.\n\n**Potential Issues or Points of Caution:**\n- While the code itself appears safe, the `get_cli_string` function accepts user input parameters that could be used in a shell context. If these strings are later executed without sanitization, there could be shell injection risks. However, the current code only constructs strings, not executes them.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, given the code's nature.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.3 — Slight concern about potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — Minor risk if inputs are untrusted and used improperly, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard utility module with no malicious or obfuscated components. The main concern is proper handling of user input when these command strings are later used/executed, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed risk assessment or suggestions for secure usage practices.",
