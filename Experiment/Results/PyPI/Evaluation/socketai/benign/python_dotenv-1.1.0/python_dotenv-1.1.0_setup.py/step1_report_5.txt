  "purpose": "Setup script for the python-dotenv package, used to read environment variables from .env files and set them as environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading the content of files 'README.md', 'CHANGELOG.md', and './src/dotenv/version.py'; reading files in 'read_files' function.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or executes untrusted data directly; no sinks for malicious data found.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (input) into variables like 'long_description' and 'meta', but these are static files and not user input; no dynamic execution of untrusted data occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute code read from 'version.py' is potentially risky if the file content is malicious or tampered with. However, in typical package versioning, this file is controlled and static. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for package description and version information, then calls 'setup' with predefined parameters. The only dynamic code execution occurs with 'exec' on 'version.py', which is a common pattern for versioning but could be a security concern if the file is compromised. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a typical use of 'exec' to load version info. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. The use of 'exec' on version file is a potential concern but is common and generally safe if the file is controlled. Overall, the script appears safe and legitimate.",
