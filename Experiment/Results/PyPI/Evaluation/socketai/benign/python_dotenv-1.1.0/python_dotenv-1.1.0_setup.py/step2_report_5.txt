  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard setup.py pattern\n- Reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md for long description\n- Reads and executes 'version.py' via exec() to obtain version info\n- No external network activity, user input, or obfuscated code\n- Uses 'exec' on a local version file, which is common but potentially risky if the file is compromised\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no malicious code, 'exec' is common\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity, and 'exec' on trusted local files is standard. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, 'exec' on version.py is a minor concern\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior, just noting 'exec' risk, which is acceptable in controlled environments.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above\n- **Findings:** Use of 'exec' is a potential risk if version.py is malicious\n- **Risk:** 0.4 (higher than others)\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Analysis:** The increased risk score (0.4) is justified given the potential for executing malicious code if version.py is compromised. Still, in typical controlled build environments, this is acceptable. No signs of actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above\n- **Findings:** 'exec' is a potential risk but standard practice\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious activity, just the standard caveat about 'exec'.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above\n- **Findings:** 'exec' on version.py is typical, no malicious behavior\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity, and the 'exec' usage is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusions:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. All reports agree that the code is standard setup code with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Use of 'exec':** Not ideal but common in setup scripts for versioning. The potential risk is acknowledged, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Scores:** The malware score should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** Confirmed as 0; no obfuscated code is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the consistent low risk and the standard nature of the code, a score of **0.2** remains appropriate, with the exception of Report 3, which raised the risk to 0.4 due to the 'exec' concern. This is justified but still low.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — typical setup script, with a minor concern over 'exec' usage, which is acceptable in controlled environments.\n\n**In summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-understood setup script with no signs of malicious activity. The use of 'exec' on local version files is a common pattern, though it warrants caution if the files are not trusted. The overall security posture is low risk, and no malware is present.",
