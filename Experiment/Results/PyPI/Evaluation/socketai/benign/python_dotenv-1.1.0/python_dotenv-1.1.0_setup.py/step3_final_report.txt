  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, reading documentation and version info, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and executes 'version.py' to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "File reads lead to data used in setup; 'exec' runs code from 'version.py' to set version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' on 'version.py' could be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with no malicious intent. The only potential concern is executing 'version.py' via 'exec()', which is common but can be risky if the file is compromised. No network activity, user input, or obfuscation is present. The 'exec()' usage is standard in many setup scripts, assuming the source files are trusted. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary risk is the use of 'exec()' on a local file, which is acceptable in controlled environments. Overall, the code is safe, with a low security risk.",
