{
  "purpose": "This code appears to parse and resolve environment variables within a string, supporting default values, for use in environment or configuration management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'value' string parameter in 'parse_variables', and from the environment mapping passed to 'resolve' methods of 'Variable' and 'Literal'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'resolve' methods where data from environment variables or defaults is retrieved and returned; however, this is standard behavior and not inherently unsafe.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows into 'parse_variables', which identifies variable patterns and yields 'Literal' or 'Variable' objects; then, calling 'resolve' on these objects retrieves environment data, forming source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The regex for variable parsing is standard. No dynamic code execution, network access, or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly parses environment variable placeholders within a string and resolves them based on provided environment mappings. It uses standard regex for pattern matching and conventional class structures. No malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is straightforward and aligns with common configuration parsing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for environment variable interpolation within strings. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, and the logic is transparent and well-structured. No indicators of malicious intent or malicious code are present.",
