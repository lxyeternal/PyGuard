  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code parses environment variable placeholders, resolves them via environment mapping. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Code presence**: The code matches the description—parsing variables with regex, classes for Literal and Variable, resolve methods. No discrepancies.\n- **Errors or flaws**: None apparent; the logic is straightforward.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n  - Security Risk: 0 — Correct.\n- **Justification**: The report's confidence is high; the code is standard, safe, and transparent.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, parsing POSIX variables, no malicious activity, standard regex.\n- **Code presence**: Matches the code snippet.\n- **Errors or flaws**: None detected.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n  - Security Risk: 0 — Correct.\n- **Justification**: The code is benign; the report is accurate.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Parses shell-like variables, no suspicious behavior, no network or system calls.\n- **Code presence**: Matches the code; the regex and parsing logic are standard.\n- **Errors or flaws**: None.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated, but given the benign nature, perhaps too high.\n- **Justification**: The score of 0.2 for security risk suggests minor concern, but since the code only does string parsing and environment variable resolution, this is likely overestimating risk.\n- **Conclusion**: The security risk score should probably be 0, as there's no evident vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports; standard variable parsing and resolution.\n- **Code presence**: Confirmed.\n- **Errors or flaws**: None.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n  - Security Risk: 0 — Correct.\n- **Justification**: The report's assessment aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as others; straightforward variable parsing utility.\n- **Code presence**: Matches.\n- **Errors or flaws**: None.\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n  - Security Risk: 0 — Correct.\n- **Justification**: The code is safe; no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion**: Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign environment variable parser.\n- The only questionable score is the security risk of 0.2 in Report 3, which seems unjustified given the code's simplicity and lack of side effects.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 for all, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score**: 0 for all, since the code is a standard, safe utility with no security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a straightforward environment variable parser with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores should be consistent across reports, with the security risk being 0, not 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Final note**: All reports are accurate in their assessments; minor adjustments to the security risk score in Report 3 are recommended.",
