  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the described findings, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code parses environment variable placeholders and resolves them. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent. The logic is standard for environment variable substitution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code parses POSIX-style variables, with no suspicious activity or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The regex and logic are standard, and no malicious actions are implied.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code parses shell-like variables, with no signs of malicious behavior. The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but still indicates benign intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.2 is slightly elevated but still low, reflecting minimal concern. The malware score remains 0, aligning with the benign analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is reasonable. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard utility for environment variable parsing, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, parsing environment variables without malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code and previous reports.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly elevated in Report 3 (0.2), but still low. Given the code's simplicity and lack of side effects, a score of 0.2 is reasonable, but it could also be 0 for a more conservative stance.\n- **Confidence:** High across all reports, as the analysis aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 for minimal caution, but 0 is justified)  \n\nThe code is a standard environment variable parser with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is negligible, and the scores should reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's benign nature. No changes are necessary.",
