  "purpose": "Parse and resolve POSIX-style environment variable placeholders within strings, supporting default values.",
  "sources": "Input string 'value' containing variable placeholders matched by regex _posix_variable.",
  "sinks": "Resolved variable values returned by resolve() methods; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Regex matches extract variable names/defaults; Literal and Variable objects are yielded; resolve() retrieves values from env mapping.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard regex and class structure. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex for variable pattern matching, classes for literal and variable tokens, and a parser function parse_variables. It performs standard string parsing, tokenization, and environment variable resolution without side effects or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or code injection points are present. The logic is clear, and the code is transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for parsing and resolving environment variables with defaults. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
