  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating synthetic datasets, including time series and mimesis-based data, primarily for testing and data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Standard libraries such as random, packaging.version, dask.utils, and optional dependencies like mimesis (imported dynamically). Data inputs are parameters for data generation, seeds, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Local data structures and dataframes; no external network or file system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (start/end dates, seed, data types) are processed to generate synthetic data via library functions, with seed control for reproducibility. Optional dependencies are imported only when needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of dynamic import_required is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard practices for synthetic data generation, with clear parameter handling, seed management, and version checks for compatibility. No external communication or malicious logic is present. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and use common libraries for their purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for synthetic data creation, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
