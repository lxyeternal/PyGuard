  "anomalies": [
    "Use of random.Random with a seed for reproducibility, which is standard",
    "Dynamic import of 'mimesis' without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
    "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or backdoors",
    "Function names and logic are consistent with their purposes",
    "No code executing external commands or network activity"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines functions for data generation using well-known libraries (dask, mimesis). It uses standard practices for reproducibility (seeding), dynamic importing, and schema-based mock data creation. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network communication, credential handling, or backdoors are present. The use of random seed for data variability is normal. No obfuscated code or hidden logic identified. The code appears to be a legitimate data generation utility with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for generating synthetic datasets with no malicious behavior detected. It relies on common libraries and practices for data simulation, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
