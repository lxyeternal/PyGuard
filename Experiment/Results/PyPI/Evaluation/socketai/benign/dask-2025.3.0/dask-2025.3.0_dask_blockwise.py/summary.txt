  "security_risk": 0.2,

  "confidence": 0.95,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, internal component of Dask for blockwise graph management and optimization. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified by its complexity and environment variable usage in testing contexts. Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriate."
