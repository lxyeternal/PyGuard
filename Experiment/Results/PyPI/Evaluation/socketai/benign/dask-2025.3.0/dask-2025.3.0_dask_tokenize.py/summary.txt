  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-driven deterministic tokenization utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of serialization and fallback mechanisms introduces some nondeterminism and inherent risks but are justified safety measures. Overall, the system is low risk, with no obfuscated or malicious code detected."
