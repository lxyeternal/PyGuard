{
  "purpose": "This code is used to configure the setup process for a Python package, utilizing versioneer for version management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules (__future__, versioneer, setuptools) and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses data obtained from versioneer and static strings; there are no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports future annotations for compatibility, then imports versioneer and setuptools. It calls versioneer's functions to get version info and command classes, then passes them to setup(). There are no user inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The structure and content are typical for Python package setup files. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package using versioneer. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and purposeful for package configuration.",
