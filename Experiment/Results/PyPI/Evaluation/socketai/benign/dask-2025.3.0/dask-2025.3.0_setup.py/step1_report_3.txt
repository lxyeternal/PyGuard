  "purpose": "Configure the package setup using versioneer for version management in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports versioneer and setuptools; calls versioneer's functions to retrieve version info and command classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only retrieves version info and sets up package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code executes static function calls with no user input or external data involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal and standard for a Python project setup; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports versioneer for version management and setuptools for packaging. It retrieves version information and command classes from versioneer and passes them to setup(), which is typical in Python packaging. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, or obfuscated code. It functions solely to configure package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package utilizing versioneer. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
