  "purpose": "Pytest configuration and dependency management setup for Dask project testing.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dependency checks, pytest option definitions, and fixture setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external communication, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Dependency import checks influence conditional test skipping; no malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Standard dependency import checks; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency checks, configures pytest options, and sets up fixtures for test environment. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The dependency checks are standard practice and do not introduce security risks. No external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is evident. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended solely for test setup. The slight elevation in risk score in some reports (e.g., 0.1) is unjustified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard pytest configuration script for the Dask project with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should be uniformly zero for malware and obfuscation, and the risk score should be zero, reflecting the safe and routine nature of the code.",
