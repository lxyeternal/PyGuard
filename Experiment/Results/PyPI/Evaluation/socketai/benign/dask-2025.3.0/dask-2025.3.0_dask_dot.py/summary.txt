  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented set of visualization utilities for Dask graphs with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The low security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting minimal concerns related to dynamic imports and file I/O, which are standard in such utilities."
