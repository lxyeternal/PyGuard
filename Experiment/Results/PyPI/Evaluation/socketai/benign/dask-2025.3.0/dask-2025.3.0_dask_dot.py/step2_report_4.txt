  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes visualization functions for Dask graphs, no suspicious sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Visualization outputs and file writes are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no external network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard visualization code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.\n- SecurityRisk: 0 — no evident risks.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and consistent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions with string pattern matching for hashes/UUIDs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Produces visualizations, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard visualization utilities.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.\n- SecurityRisk: 0 — minimal, justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Visualization with external libraries, dynamic imports, file outputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Writes HTML files, uses external visualization libraries.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Dynamic import with `import_required` is standard for optional dependencies; no network activity or data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe visualization code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, justified due to file operations and dynamic imports, but overall low risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar visualization functions, converting graphs to formats.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** File writes, visualization rendering.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, standard external library usage, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — justified due to file operations and external dependencies.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Visualization with external libraries, standard file operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Exporting images and HTML files.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no network connections.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate visualization utilities.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — acceptable given file I/O and external libs.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to file operations and dynamic imports, which is justified given the context but not indicative of serious risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by file operations and dynamic imports, but no active threats.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses. No adjustments are necessary. The code is a benign set of visualization utilities for Dask graphs with no security concerns.",
