{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to visualize and export Dask task graphs using Graphviz and Cytoscape, including rendering graphs to files and creating interactive visualizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported libraries, function parameters, and file operations for exporting images and HTML files.",
  "sinks": "File write operations (open, write) and the use of external libraries to generate and save visualizations, including graph images and HTML files.",
  "flows": "Input data (dsk) flows through visualization functions, which generate graph representations and write outputs to files or display objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code includes standard visualization procedures and safe use of environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily relies on well-known libraries (dask, graphviz, ipycytoscape) to visualize task graphs. It handles file operations and external library imports carefully, with fallbacks for missing libraries. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or code injection, is present. Functions create visual representations and export files, which are typical in such tools. No obfuscated code patterns or indicators of malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate visualization utility for Dask task graphs, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It correctly uses external libraries to generate visual outputs and handles file operations securely. The overall security risk is minimal.",
