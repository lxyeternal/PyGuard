  "purpose": "Visualization utilities for Dask graphs, including functions to generate Graphviz, Cytoscape, and IPython display objects.",
  "sources": "Data structures representing Dask task graphs, external visualization libraries, string pattern matching for labels.",
  "sinks": "File outputs (images, HTML), display objects in IPython, JSON data for Cytoscape.",
  "flows": "Graph data structures are processed into visualization formats, written to files or displayed inline.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected. Use of dynamic imports is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code provides visualization functions for Dask graphs, utilizing external libraries like graphviz, ipycytoscape, and IPython.display. It processes graph data to generate visual representations, either inline or saved to files. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of cache in label functions and dynamic imports are benign and common in optional dependency handling. File operations are controlled and typical for visualization tools. Overall, the code is well-structured, clear, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented set of visualization utilities for Dask graphs with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The low security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, reflecting minimal concerns related to dynamic imports and file I/O, which are standard in such utilities.",
