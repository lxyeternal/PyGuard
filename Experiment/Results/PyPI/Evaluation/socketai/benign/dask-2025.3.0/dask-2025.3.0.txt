      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.1) is justified by its internal attribute access and dynamic type invocation, which are common in data processing libraries. Overall, it is safe and standard within its context."

The low risk score reflects the potential for data exposure if sensitive data is passed into the graphs, but this is a normal concern for such utilities and not indicative of malicious intent."

The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins loaded via entry points, which could be malicious if registered by an attacker. Overall, the code itself is safe, and the scores are appropriate given the context."

The use of serialization and fallback mechanisms introduces some nondeterminism and inherent risks but are justified safety measures. Overall, the system is low risk, with no obfuscated or malicious code detected."
