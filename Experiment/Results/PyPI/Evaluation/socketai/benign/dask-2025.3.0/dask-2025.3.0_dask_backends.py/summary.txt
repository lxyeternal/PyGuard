  "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin management system for backend dispatching, with no malicious intent or behavior detected. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins loaded via entry points, which could be malicious if registered by an attacker. Overall, the code itself is safe, and the scores are appropriate given the context."
