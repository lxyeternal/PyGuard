  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Flask extension for resolving resource URLs from view names. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the safe use of resolve_params, which appears standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the minimal potential for misuse if untrusted data is processed insecurely."
