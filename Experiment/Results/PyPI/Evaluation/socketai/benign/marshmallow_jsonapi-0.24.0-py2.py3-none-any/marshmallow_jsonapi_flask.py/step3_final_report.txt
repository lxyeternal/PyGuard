{
  "purpose": "Provides Flask-specific schema and relationship classes that generate resource URLs from view names using flask.url_for(), facilitating dynamic URL resolution in JSON API schemas.",
  "sources": "Meta attributes such as self_view, self_view_kwargs, self_view_many; input parameters to generate_url and get_url methods; object attributes used in resolve_params.",
  "sinks": "flask.url_for() function calls within generate_url, get_url, get_related_url, get_self_url methods.",
  "flows": "View name and kwargs from meta attributes or object data → resolve_params → flask.url_for() → URL string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Validation in SchemaOpts prevents misconfiguration. Exception handling around URL generation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask extension for dynamic URL generation based on view names, with validation to ensure correct configuration. It uses flask.url_for() to generate URLs, with optional error handling for BuildError. The resolve_params utility processes view kwargs, which could be a concern if it handles untrusted data, but no evidence suggests unsafe behavior. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for Flask URL resolution. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Flask extension for resolving resource URLs from view names. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the safe use of resolve_params, which appears standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the minimal potential for misuse if untrusted data is processed insecurely.",
