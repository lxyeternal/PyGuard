  "purpose": "Module initializer importing Schema classes, setting version, and defining public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.schema'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Import from '.schema' to local namespace; no data flow beyond static imports.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, static, and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a local module, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for public API. It contains no dynamic behavior, user input, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
