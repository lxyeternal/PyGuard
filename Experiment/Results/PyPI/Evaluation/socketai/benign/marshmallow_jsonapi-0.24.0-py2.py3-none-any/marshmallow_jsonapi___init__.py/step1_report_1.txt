{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module metadata, importing classes and setting export variables.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.schema), setting version string, defining __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only imports and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes Schema and SchemaOpts from a relative module, defining a version string, and specifying exported symbols. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to serve as a simple module interface or metadata file, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module initializer with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
