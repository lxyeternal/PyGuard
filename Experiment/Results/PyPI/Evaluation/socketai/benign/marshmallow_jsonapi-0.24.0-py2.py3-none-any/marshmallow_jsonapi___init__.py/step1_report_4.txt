  "purpose": "Defines module version and exports symbols from schema module",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Schema and SchemaOpts from the same package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code is only defining constants and imports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a local schema module, sets a version string, and defines the exported symbols. It is straightforward and contains no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code. The code is typical for module initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module initializer with versioning and export definitions. There are no security concerns or malware indicators.",
