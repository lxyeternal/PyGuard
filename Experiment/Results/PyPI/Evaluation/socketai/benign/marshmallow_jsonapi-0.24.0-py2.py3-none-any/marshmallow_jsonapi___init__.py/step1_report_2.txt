  "purpose": "Export schema-related classes and define package version information",
  "sources": "Import statement for schema modules, assignment of __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import and assignment are static",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a relative module, sets a version string, and defines __all__ for exports. All operations are static, standard, and typical for package initialization. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization with no malicious intent or security issues.",
