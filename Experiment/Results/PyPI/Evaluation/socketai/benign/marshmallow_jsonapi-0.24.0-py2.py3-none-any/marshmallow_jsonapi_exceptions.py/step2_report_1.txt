  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code defines straightforward custom exception classes for JSON API error handling.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or untrusted data flows are present.\n- The exception classes format error messages based on provided parameters, with no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and appears to serve purely for error reporting within an API context.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n- The 'malware' score assigned in all reports is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The 'obfuscated' score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The 'securityRisk' score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are uniform and consistent; no anomalies or errors are identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling.\n- No evidence suggests any malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — No obfuscation present.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' evaluations.** The code is benign, straightforward, and does not pose any security threat.",
