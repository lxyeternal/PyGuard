  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling JSON API errors, specifically for type validation errors.",
  "sources": "The class definitions and their methods, including __init__ and property methods.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; exception messages are generated internally.",
  "flows": "No external data flow; exception details are formatted internally and raised as standard exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and ValueError. The IncorrectTypeError class formats an error message based on provided 'actual' and 'expected' values, which are optional, and constructs a JSON-formatted error response. There are no external data sources or sinks, no use of untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard for error handling in a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for error handling within a package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies.",
