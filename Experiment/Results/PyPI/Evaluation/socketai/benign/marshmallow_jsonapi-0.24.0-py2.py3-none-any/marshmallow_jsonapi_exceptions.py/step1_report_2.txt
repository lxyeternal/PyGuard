  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JSON API error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code defines classes and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception initialization is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. The IncorrectTypeError class formats error messages based on provided parameters and includes a property to return a JSON-formatted error object. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be standard error handling code with proper structure, without any malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
