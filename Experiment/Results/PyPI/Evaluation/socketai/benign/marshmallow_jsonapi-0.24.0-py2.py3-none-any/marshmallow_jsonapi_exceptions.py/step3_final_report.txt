{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JSON API error handling, specifically for invalid type errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception classes are instantiated with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; error messages are formatted internally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, actual, expected) flow into message formatting, then into exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, with proper message formatting and a property returning a JSON API error structure. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security flaws. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for API error reporting. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
