  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JSON API error handling.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading; static class and method definitions).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or external communication).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions inheriting from Exception and ValueError. The IncorrectTypeError class formats an error message based on provided parameters and returns a JSON-formatted error structure. No dynamic code execution, input/output, or external communication is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard exception handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a basic exception class implementation for error handling in a JSON API context. There are no malicious or suspicious elements present.",
