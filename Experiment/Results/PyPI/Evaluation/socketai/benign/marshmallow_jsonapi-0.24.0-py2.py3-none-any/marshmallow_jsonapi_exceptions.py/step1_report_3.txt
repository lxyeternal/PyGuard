  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a JSON API handling package.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, constructor parameters, and property method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any external data sinks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, actual, expected) flow into the detail attribute via string formatting; no external or network data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions inheriting from built-in exceptions, with standard attribute initialization and a property method returning a dictionary. No input/output handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The constructor carefully formats error messages with provided data, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code appears to serve straightforward exception handling purposes within a larger application context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
