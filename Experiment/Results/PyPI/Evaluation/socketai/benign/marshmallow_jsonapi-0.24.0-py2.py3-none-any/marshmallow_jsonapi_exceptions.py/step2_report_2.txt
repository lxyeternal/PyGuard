  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes for API error handling.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n   - The code adheres to standard Python practices, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0.0\n     - Obfuscated: 0.0\n     - Security Risk: 0.0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely for error handling with no malicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The consistent zero scores across malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's structure and behavior.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores align well with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**My Overall Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Final Remarks:**\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling.\n- No issues related to security, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the thorough review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is benign, well-structured, and free of security concerns. No adjustments are necessary.",
