  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Verification:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions, particularly `IncorrectTypeError`. The code formats error messages based on optional parameters and provides a JSON API error structure via a property. No external data sources, sinks, or network operations are involved. The code is standard and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n   The reports uniformly agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior. They do not identify any logical errors or security flaws. Given the simplicity and clarity of the code, this consensus appears accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Review and Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate since there are no malicious behaviors.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0, as the code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n   These scores seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**  \n   - The code is purely for error handling; it does not process untrusted input beyond formatting messages, and no external communication occurs.  \n   - The error messages are constructed internally and do not reveal sensitive data.  \n   - No signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n\n5. **Consistency and Further Recommendations:**  \n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.  \n   - Given the simplicity, no adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It does not pose any security or malware concerns.\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the code appears safe and well-structured.",
