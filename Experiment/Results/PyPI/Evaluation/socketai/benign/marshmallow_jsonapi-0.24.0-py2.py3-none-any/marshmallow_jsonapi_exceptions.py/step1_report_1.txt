  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a JSON API implementation.",
  "sources": "The class definitions and their methods, particularly the __init__ constructor and the 'messages' property.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is sent to external systems, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flow to external sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard Python exception class patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and ValueError. The IncorrectTypeError class formats error details based on provided actual and expected values, and provides a JSON API error message. The implementation appears standard for error handling with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. There are no external data sources, sinks, or suspicious logic involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes intended for error handling in an API context. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
