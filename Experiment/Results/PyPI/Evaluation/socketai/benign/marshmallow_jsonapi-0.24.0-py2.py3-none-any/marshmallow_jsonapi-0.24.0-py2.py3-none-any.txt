      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Flask extension for resolving resource URLs from view names. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the safe use of resolve_params, which appears standard. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the minimal potential for misuse if untrusted data is processed insecurely."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for marshmallow JSON API fields with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected. The main potential security concern is the external resolve_params function used in URL formatting, which should be verified for safety. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe under normal trust assumptions."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and performs straightforward utility tasks without malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of get_value from marshmallow is standard and does not introduce security risks. The regex pattern is simple and safe. Overall, the code poses no security threat or supply chain risk."
