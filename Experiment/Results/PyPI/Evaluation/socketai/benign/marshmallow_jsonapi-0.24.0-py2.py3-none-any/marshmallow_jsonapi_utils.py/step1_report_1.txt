  "purpose": "Utility functions for resolving template-like strings within objects, primarily used internally for parameter substitution.",
  "sources": "Input is from function arguments `obj`, `params`, and `val` in `tpl`; also external modules `re` and `marshmallow.utils.get_value`.",
  "sinks": "The code reads attribute values via `get_value`, but does not write or send data externally. No sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The flow is: string input `val` is matched to extract attribute name, then `get_value` retrieves attribute from `obj`, which is then used to populate `param_values`.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. The regex pattern is straightforward. The code relies on external libraries for attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The module provides safe utility functions for resolving template strings enclosed in '< >' from object attributes. The regex pattern correctly extracts attribute names. The `resolve_params` function safely retrieves attribute values using `get_value` and handles missing attributes with proper error handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modification. It solely processes and returns data based on object attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions intended for internal parameter resolution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
