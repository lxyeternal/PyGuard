{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for resolving parameters based on attribute templates within objects.",
  "sources": "The function `resolve_params` reads from the `params` dictionary, and calls `get_value` from marshmallow.utils to access object attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present; data is retrieved from object attributes based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters in `params` are parsed with regex to extract attribute names; these are then used to retrieve attribute values from `obj` via `get_value`.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns. The regex and attribute access are standard. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The module is explicitly marked as private API.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions with standard behavior. The regex `_tpl_pattern` matches simple `<...>` patterns. The `tpl` function extracts attribute names. `resolve_params` resolves these attribute names from an object using `get_value`. There are no external data injections, code execution, or data leaks. The code only performs safe attribute lookups. The code appears clean, straightforward, and intended for internal use without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs safe attribute resolution within objects, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a utility module meant for internal use, with no external input/output vulnerabilities.",
