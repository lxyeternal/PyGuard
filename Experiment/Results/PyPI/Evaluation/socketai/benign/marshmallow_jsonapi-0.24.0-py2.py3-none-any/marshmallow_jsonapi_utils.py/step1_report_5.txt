  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and resolving template-like parameters within objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the `val` parameter in `tpl()` and from `params` dictionary in `resolve_params()`.",
  "sinks": "The code calls `get_value()` from marshmallow.utils, which may access object attributes. No direct untrusted sink is evident, but potential data flow exists if input is uncontrolled.",
  "flows": "Input `val` flows through `tpl()` to extract template names; in `resolve_params()`, attribute names are extracted from `params` and used to retrieve object attribute values via `get_value()`.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code relies on `get_value()` for attribute retrieval, which could be a source of indirect issues if `get_value()` is malicious or compromised.",
  "analysis": "The module provides functions to parse strings for template patterns and resolve parameters based on object attributes. The `tpl()` function uses regex to extract names within `< >`. The `resolve_params()` function maps parameter names to attribute values, using `get_value()` to retrieve attributes dynamically. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures. The code is straightforward, using standard Python and marshmallow utilities. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage, and the functions serve utility purposes with no external side effects or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for parameter resolution based on object attributes. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The reliance on `get_value()` is standard for marshmallow-based code and does not indicate malicious behavior by itself.",
