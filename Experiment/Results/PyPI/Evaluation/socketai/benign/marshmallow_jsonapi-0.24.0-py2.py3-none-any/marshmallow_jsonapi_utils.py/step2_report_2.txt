  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a small utility module for parsing strings with `< >` and resolving parameters from object attributes.\n- It uses regex and marshmallow's `get_value` for attribute access.\n- No external network, file I/O, or code execution is involved.\n- The code appears straightforward, safe, and intended for internal use.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly higher confidence (0.9). The security risk is 0.1, possibly due to the use of external library `get_value`.\n- **Analysis:** The code only reads attributes; no data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The minimal security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the code's simplicity and safe attribute access.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, very straightforward, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Again, similar, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same utility functions, no malicious behavior, but notes that `get_value()` could be a point of concern if compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk (0.2) is acceptable, considering the reliance on an external utility function.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Checking the Scores and Claims:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified due to the use of external attribute access, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### **Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. No report assigns a high risk or malware score unjustifiably.\n- The only point to consider is whether the security risk should be slightly higher due to reliance on external libraries, but given the context, 0.1–0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, justified by external dependency and simple attribute access)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is a benign utility module for internal parameter resolution, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate after review:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to external dependency, but still very low)\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and their reasoning.",
