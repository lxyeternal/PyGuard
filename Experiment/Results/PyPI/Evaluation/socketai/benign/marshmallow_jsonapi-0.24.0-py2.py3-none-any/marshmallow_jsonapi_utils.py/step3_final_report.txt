  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing template strings and resolving object attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads input strings for pattern matching; accesses object attributes via get_value.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network interactions; attribute values are retrieved locally.",
  "flows": "Input string matched by regex -> attribute name extracted -> get_value retrieves attribute value.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple regex matching to extract attribute names within '< >' and resolves these to object attributes using marshmallow's get_value. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The functions are designed for internal use, with proper error handling for missing attributes. No external data flows or network activity are involved. The code is clear, safe, and standard for such utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and performs straightforward utility tasks without malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of get_value from marshmallow is standard and does not introduce security risks. The regex pattern is simple and safe. Overall, the code poses no security threat or supply chain risk.",
