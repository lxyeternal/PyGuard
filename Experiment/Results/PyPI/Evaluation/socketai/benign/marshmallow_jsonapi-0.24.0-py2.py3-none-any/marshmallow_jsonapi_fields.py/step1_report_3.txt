{
  "purpose": "Define custom marshmallow fields for JSON API serialization, including relationship handling and meta objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from marshmallow and utils, class constructors, and methods accessing class attributes and external functions such as resolve_params.",
  "sinks": "Methods that format URLs (get_related_url, get_self_url), data serialization/deserialization, and potential data modification points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., relationship data, meta objects) through validation and serialization methods, potentially involving external URL resolution and schema loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `resolve_params` to dynamically generate URLs, potential reliance on external functions; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, excessive dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for JSON API serialization, including Relationship, DocumentMeta, and ResourceMeta, with methods for URL generation, data extraction, validation, and serialization. The URL generation relies on `resolve_params`, which interprets object attributes for URL formatting. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious data handling are present. Use of standard marshmallow patterns and validation suggests normal behavior. The only external dependency, `resolve_params`, is assumed safe given its typical utility role. No hidden backdoors, external connections, or malicious code segments are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of JSON API schema fields with no malicious behavior or supply chain security risks detected. It performs URL resolution, data validation, and serialization in a typical manner consistent with library code. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities were observed.",
