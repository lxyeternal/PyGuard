{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include reading environment variables, input functions, or file I/O operations (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network communications, file writes, or system calls, though none are explicitly present in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Without explicit code, no clear source-to-sink data flows can be identified.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscated segments; however, the absence of context limits full analysis.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is either minimal or not included; therefore, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be conducted. The code does not show signs of malicious patterns such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious external calls. The structure appears straightforward and typical for standard utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risk in this code. It seems benign, but the lack of detailed code prevents a definitive assessment.",
