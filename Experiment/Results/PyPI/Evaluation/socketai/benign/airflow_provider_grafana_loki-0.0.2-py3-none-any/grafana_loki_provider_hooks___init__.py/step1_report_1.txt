  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python script or module possibly related to data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, and possibly from imported modules or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code based on input or data received.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as network or file operations, possibly passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. The code contains standard constructs, with no obvious obfuscation or malicious constructs. Slight irregularity in dynamic execution or unusual data handling patterns is absent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, utilizing common Python libraries and functions. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The code does not demonstrate unsafe SQL, insecure environment variable handling, or arbitrary code execution. The structure is clear, and no obfuscated or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no indicators of supply chain sabotage, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
