  "sources": "Input sources could include user input, environment variables, or external files if present, but none are specified here.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands if present, but none are evident without code details.",
  "flows": "Flow from input sources to sinks cannot be established without actual code content.",
  "anomalies": "No code provided; therefore, no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior can be detected.",
  "analysis": "No code fragment was provided for review. As a result, it is impossible to analyze source-to-sink flows, identify anomalies, or detect malicious patterns. The review process relies on detailed code content to identify potential security risks.",
