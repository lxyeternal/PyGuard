  "conclusion": "The code in all reports appears benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Security risk is low (around 0.1 to 0.3), primarily due to potential data flow concerns in report 5. Malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The overall security posture based on these reports is considered safe, with no immediate supply chain threats identified."
