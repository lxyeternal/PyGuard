  "purpose": "Define and return metadata information for an Airflow provider package related to Grafana Loki.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or external data; it simply returns a static dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows into the system; the function returns static data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely returns hardcoded information.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a commented-out line about deprecated hook class names, which may suggest some version handling but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The function get_provider_info returns a hardcoded dictionary with package metadata. No external input, user data, or environment variables are used. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The commented line indicates awareness of deprecated features but does not execute or impact runtime behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a simple static metadata provider with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration or metadata provider. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
