  "anomalies": "Presence of commented-out code may indicate deprecated or unused code, but not malicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply returns a static dictionary with metadata about a package. No external inputs, environment variable use, network activity, or executable code present. The commented line suggests deprecated functionality, which is common in maintained codebases. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static data structure defining package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks.",
