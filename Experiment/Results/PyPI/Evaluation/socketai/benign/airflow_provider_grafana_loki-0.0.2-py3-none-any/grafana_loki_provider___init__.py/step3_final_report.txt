  "purpose": "Provides static package metadata information for the airflow provider plugin.",
  "sources": "Static dictionary literals within the function; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out line referencing deprecated hook class; no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static function returning package metadata with no dynamic execution, external input handling, or network activity. The commented-out line is deprecated but harmless. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and static nature justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe, serving only as metadata. No malicious or obfuscated elements are detected. All scores are appropriately set to zero, and no further action is necessary.",
