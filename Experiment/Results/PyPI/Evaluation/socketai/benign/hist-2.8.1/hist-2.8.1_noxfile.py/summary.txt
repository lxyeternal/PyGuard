  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard automation script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the potential for command injection via session.posargs, but this is a known and controlled risk in such scripts. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score around 0.2 is justified due to external command execution and dependencies. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use in development workflows."
