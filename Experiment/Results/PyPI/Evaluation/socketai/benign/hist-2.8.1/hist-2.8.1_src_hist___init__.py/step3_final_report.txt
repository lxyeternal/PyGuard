{
  "purpose": "Module initializer for a histogram package, importing internal modules, defining exports, and providing a warning for a common typo ('axes' instead of 'axis').",
  "sources": "Static code imports and attribute access; no external data input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "The __getattr__ method issues a warning when 'axes' is accessed, which is benign and intended as a user help feature.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with imports, version info, and a __getattr__ warning for a misspelling. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The warning about 'axes' is harmless. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks. The warning mechanism is benign. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
