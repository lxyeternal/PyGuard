  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a module initializer with imports, version info, and a __getattr__ warning for a misspelling ('axes' instead of 'axis'). No suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct, no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on benign attribute management and no malicious logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — safe.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; benign module setup with a helpful warning.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, but the reasoning suggests it's benign. Given the benign nature, this could be lowered to 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign setup, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; no malicious activity, just module setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard module initializer, primarily importing internal modules, defining __all__, and implementing a __getattr__ warning for a common typo. No dynamic code execution, no external data handling, no network activity.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero; the only minor point is the warning for a typo, which is benign.\n\n### Final scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if being conservative, but given the analysis, 0 is more appropriate)\n\n**Recommendation:** The reports correctly identify this code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The small risk score in Report 3 can be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Risk           | 0              |\n\nThis code is a standard, safe module setup for a histogram library with no security concerns.",
