{
  "purpose": "This module provides imports and exports related to histogram management, including classes, functions, and constants used for histogram operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input points are explicitly present in this code. It mainly imports internal modules and defines attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are apparent as the code is primarily about module structure and attribute handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to handle missing attribute 'axes' with a warning suggests a typo correction mechanism. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. No malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up module-level imports and exports for histogram-related classes and functions. It includes a custom __getattr__ to handle a common typo ('axes' instead of 'axis') with a warning. No external input, data processing, or network activity is involved. The code appears to be standard package setup code, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup script for a histogram package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
