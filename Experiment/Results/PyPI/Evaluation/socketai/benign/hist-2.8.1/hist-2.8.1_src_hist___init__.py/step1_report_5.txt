{
  "purpose": "This module appears to provide a public API for histogram-related classes and functions, with some utility functions and re-exports for ease of access.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'import warnings' and relative imports of modules such as accumulators, axis, numpy, storage, tag, and version.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not process untrusted input or perform any data transmission.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present. The code primarily sets up module attributes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected. The code contains a warning for a misspelling ('axes' vs. 'axis') which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level imports, re-exports, and utility functions. It includes a warning for a misspelled attribute but no actual malicious behavior. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data. The imports are standard for a histogram library, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup module for a histogram package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
