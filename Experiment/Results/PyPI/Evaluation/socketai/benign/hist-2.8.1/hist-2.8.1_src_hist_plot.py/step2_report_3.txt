  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and scoring justification.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The main concern is the use of `eval()` in `_expr_to_lambda`. It tokenizes the input to limit evaluation scope, reducing risk but not eliminating it.\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious behavior beyond the `eval()` usage. External dependencies are handled properly.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2. The low risk is justified since `eval()` is used with tokenization, but the potential for exploitation exists if user input is untrusted.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is reasonable. The code is generally safe but should caution about untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Highlights the `eval()` in `_expr_to_lambda` as a significant security vulnerability, emphasizing the risk of arbitrary code execution.\n- **Findings:** The risk is high if malicious input is provided, which is accurate. No other malicious activity detected.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.7. This aligns with the known risk of `eval()` on untrusted input.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the primary concern. The high security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, points out `eval()` in `_expr_to_lambda` as the main concern, but considers the risk manageable within the context.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior beyond `eval()`. The code is typical for scientific plotting.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2. Consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable and cautious, acknowledging the `eval()` risk but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the `eval()` usage, assigning a high security risk (0.6) and malware risk (0.5). It recognizes the potential for arbitrary code execution.\n- **Findings:** The `eval()` is the main concern, and the risk is justified given untrusted input.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0.5 and security risk 0.6 are reasonable, considering the potential for malicious input to execute arbitrary code.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified, emphasizing caution.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, points out `eval()` as the main vulnerability, with a low malware score (0) but a small security risk (0.2).\n- **Findings:** The code's core issue is `eval()`, but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Score justification:** The low malware score is justified; the small security risk reflects the potential if untrusted input is used.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior beyond the `eval()` concern.\n- **Main risk:** The use of `eval()` in `_expr_to_lambda` is the critical point, as it could execute arbitrary code if given malicious input.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with no actual malware detected.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation observed.\n  - **Risk scores:** Vary from 0.2 to 0.7, depending on how strongly the evaluators emphasize the `eval()` risk.\n\n**My independent estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware or backdoors detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 — the main concern is the `eval()` usage, which can be exploited if inputs are untrusted. This is a common pattern in scientific libraries but should be used with caution.\n\n**Final notes:**\n\n- The core vulnerability is the `eval()` in `_expr_to_lambda`. It should be replaced with a safer parser or sanitized input if used with untrusted data.\n- The overall code does not exhibit malicious intent or behavior; the security concern is primarily about potential code execution via user input.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                 | No malicious code or backdoors present.                      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                 | Code is clear and readable.                                   |\n| Security Risk     | 0.3               | Potential for code execution if user input is malicious.    |\n\nThis cautious approach balances the utility of the code with the known risk of `eval()` usage.",
