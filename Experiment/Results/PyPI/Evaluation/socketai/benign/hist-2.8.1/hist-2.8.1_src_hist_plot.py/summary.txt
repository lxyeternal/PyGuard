  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of eval() in _expr_to_lambda, which can execute arbitrary code if given malicious input. No active malicious activity or backdoors are present. The code is generally safe but should be used cautiously with untrusted input. A malware score of approximately 0.3 and a security risk score of about 0.4 are appropriate to reflect this risk."
