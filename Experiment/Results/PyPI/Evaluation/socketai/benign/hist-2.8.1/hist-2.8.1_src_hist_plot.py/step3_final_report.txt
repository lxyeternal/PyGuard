{
  "purpose": "Provides visualization and fitting routines for histogram data, including ratio and pull plots, with user-defined expressions parsed via eval().",
  "sources": "User-supplied expressions in _expr_to_lambda, data from hist objects during plotting and fitting.",
  "sinks": "eval() in _expr_to_lambda executes user expressions; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input expressions flow into eval() for lambda creation; data flows into plotting functions and fit routines.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() without sanitization, potential for code execution if input is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses eval() in _expr_to_lambda to parse string expressions into functions, which is inherently risky if inputs are untrusted. No malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The rest of the code performs standard plotting and fitting routines with dependencies on numpy, matplotlib, and hist. The security concern centers on eval(), which could execute arbitrary code, but the code does not actively do so. The tokenization limits scope but does not fully prevent malicious code execution. The scores assigned in the reports reflect this risk, with malware scores around 0.3 and security risk scores around 0.4-0.6. No obfuscation is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of eval() in _expr_to_lambda, which can execute arbitrary code if given malicious input. No active malicious activity or backdoors are present. The code is generally safe but should be used cautiously with untrusted input. A malware score of approximately 0.3 and a security risk score of about 0.4 are appropriate to reflect this risk.",
