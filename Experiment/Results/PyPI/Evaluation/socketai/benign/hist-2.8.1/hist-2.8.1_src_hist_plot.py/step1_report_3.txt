  "purpose": "This code provides visualization functions for histograms, including 2D plots, ratio plots, fit results, pie charts, and stacked histograms, utilizing matplotlib and hist libraries.",
  "sources": "Data sources include histogram values, axes properties, and user-provided data via function parameters and keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include matplotlib plotting functions where untrusted data could influence plot appearance or content, and eval() execution in _expr_to_lambda.",
  "flows": "Data flows from histogram objects or user inputs through functions like _expr_to_lambda or _curve_fit_wrapper, into plotting functions or eval(), then into matplotlib rendering, with some pathways involving dynamic evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() in _expr_to_lambda poses a risk if expressions are derived from untrusted sources. No other hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code relies on optional dependencies and handles missing modules gracefully.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly performs data visualization for histograms with functions that process histogram data, fit models, and generate plots. The _expr_to_lambda function converts string expressions into callable functions via eval(), which is potentially dangerous if input strings are untrusted. Other parts of the code use standard library functions and known open-source libraries with no signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The eval() usage is a notable risk but is contextually limited to mathematical expressions, which is common in scientific plotting libraries. The rest of the code performs typical data validation and plotting operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for visualization purposes, with no clear malicious intent. The only concern is the use of eval() in _expr_to_lambda, which could be exploited if expressions are not sanitized. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe when used as intended, with minimal security risks.",
