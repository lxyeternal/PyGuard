  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific functions and classes from the boost_histogram.tag module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the boost_histogram.tag module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external output; the code simply re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from an external module boost_histogram.tag and defines __all__ for exports. No user input handling, data processing, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's structure is simple and standard. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears to be a typical module re-export pattern in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard re-export module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a namespace or API simplification for other modules. No malicious activity or supply chain risks are present.",
