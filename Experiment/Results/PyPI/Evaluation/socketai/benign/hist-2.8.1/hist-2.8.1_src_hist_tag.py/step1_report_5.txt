  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes and functions from the boost_histogram.tag module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and import from boost_histogram.tag",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only re-exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from an external library (boost_histogram.tag) and defines the __all__ list for module exports. There is no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The __future__ import is standard for compatibility and does not pose security risks. The code performs a simple re-export, which is typical in package development, and contains no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing only import and export operations without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
