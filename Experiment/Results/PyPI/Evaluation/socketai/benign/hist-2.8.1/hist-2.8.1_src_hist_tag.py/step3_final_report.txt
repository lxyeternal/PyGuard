  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes and functions from boost_histogram.tag for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from boost_histogram.tag module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, user inputs, or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Static import and export; no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific symbols from a third-party library and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no data processing, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign, standard pattern of re-exporting symbols. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface for histogram components, with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
