  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder, defining project info, extensions, paths, and HTML options.",
  "sources": "The code reads package version via get_distribution('hist') from pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Static data retrieval; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard configuration pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script. It imports get_distribution to dynamically fetch the version, which is a common, safe practice. There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The configuration is static, well-structured, and uses standard extensions and paths. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration file with no malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate safe usage, and the scoring should reflect this.",
