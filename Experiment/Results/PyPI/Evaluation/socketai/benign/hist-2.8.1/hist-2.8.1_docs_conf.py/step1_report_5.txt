  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation builder with extensions and HTML options.",
  "sources": "Import of get_distribution from pkg_resources; assignment of version; configuration variables like extensions, templates_path, exclude_patterns, html_theme, html_theme_options, html_static_path, html_logo, html_title, nbsphinx_execute, highlight_language, nbsphinx_execute_arguments, nbsphinx_kernel_name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network communication, data leaks, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; configuration data is static and derived from package metadata or fixed variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of standard configuration practices and public APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, importing only standard modules and functions to set up documentation build parameters. The get_distribution function retrieves package version info in a typical manner. Extensions and paths are statically defined. There are no dynamic evaluations, user inputs, or network communications. The only external dependency is the 'pkg_resources' module, which is used safely here. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for generating project documentation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
