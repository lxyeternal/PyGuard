{
  "purpose": "Manage and visualize a collection of histograms, providing methods for stacking, plotting, and manipulating histograms.",
  "sources": "Input histograms via constructor arguments, iterable, or dictionary; data is accessed through class methods and properties.",
  "sinks": "Visualization functions (`hist.plot.plot_stack`) and print functions (`histoprint.print_hist`) output to external display or console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input histograms through class methods, including arithmetic operations and projections, to visualization or output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity; standard library usage and straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured class for managing histogram collections with validation, indexing, arithmetic operations, and visualization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. External libraries are used for visualization and printing, which are standard for such tasks. The code performs input validation, axes matching, and safe arithmetic operations, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for histogram management with visualization capabilities. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The overall security posture is very low risk, with scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1).",
