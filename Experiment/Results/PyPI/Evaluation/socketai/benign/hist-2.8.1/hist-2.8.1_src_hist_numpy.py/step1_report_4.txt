{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up exportable functions related to histogram operations, likely for data analysis or visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports the __future__ annotations feature; imports specific functions (histogram, histogram2d, histogramdd) from the boost_histogram.numpy module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code only performs imports and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports features from __future__ for compatibility, then imports specific functions from a third-party library (boost_histogram.numpy). It then defines __all__ for module exports. The code is straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior. No input handling, no network communication, and no sensitive data processing observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for histogram functions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and typical for a data analysis library.",
