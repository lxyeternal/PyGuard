{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific histogram functions from the boost_histogram.numpy library and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from boost_histogram.numpy and the __future__.annotations import",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Import from boost_histogram.numpy functions to module exports via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static import and export setup",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of histogram functions, defines __all__ for module exports, and includes a __future__ import for annotations. There are no dynamic behaviors, data leaks, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The code is simple, clear, and standard for re-exporting functions from a trusted library. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, and confidence: 1 are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module setup for re-exporting functions from a third-party library. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is appropriate for its purpose.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
