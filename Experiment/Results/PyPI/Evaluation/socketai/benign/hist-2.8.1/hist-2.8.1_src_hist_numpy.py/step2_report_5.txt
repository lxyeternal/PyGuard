  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `annotations` from `__future__` for forward reference support.\n- Imports three functions (`histogram`, `histogram2d`, `histogramdd`) from `boost_histogram.numpy`.\n- Defines `__all__` to re-export these functions.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is minimal, static, and purely for re-export purposes.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The third-party library `boost_histogram.numpy` is a known library for histogram operations, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for a module setup.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code are present.\n- No data flow from untrusted sources or sinks.\n- The purpose is solely to expose functions for external use.\n\n### Scores and Logical Consistency:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, unaltered code.\n- Security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- Since all reports are unanimous and accurate, there is no need to adjust scores.\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code's simplicity and static nature mean it cannot be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The use of `__future__.annotations` is standard for compatibility and does not introduce security concerns.\n- Importing from a trusted third-party library and re-exporting functions is common practice.\n\n**In conclusion, the code is safe, benign, and functions as intended for a module setup.**",
