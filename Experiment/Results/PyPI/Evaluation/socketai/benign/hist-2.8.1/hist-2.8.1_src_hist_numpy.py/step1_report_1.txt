{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import specific functions from a third-party library ('boost_histogram.numpy') and expose them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '__future__' and 'boost_histogram.numpy'.",
  "sinks": "None observed that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and from trusted modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The use of '__future__' import is standard for compatibility. Only three functions are exported.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, mainly importing functions from an external, well-known library and defining what to export. There is no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely for importing and exposing functions from a third-party library. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
