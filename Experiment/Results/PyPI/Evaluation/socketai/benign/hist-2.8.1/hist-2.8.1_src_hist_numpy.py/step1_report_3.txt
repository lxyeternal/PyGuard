  "purpose": "This code is setting up an import interface for histogram functions from the boost_histogram.numpy module, exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from __future__ and boost_histogram.numpy",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present; no untrusted data handling or external data flow",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hinting, then imports three histogram functions from a third-party library, and defines __all__ for module exports. No dynamic execution, data handling, or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for exporting histogram functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
