  "purpose": "Re-exports of histogram functions from boost_histogram.numpy module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from boost_histogram.numpy.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or external system interaction present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from an external library and re-exports them via __all__, which is typical for module APIs. It contains a future import for annotations to support forward references. There are no input/output operations, network communications, or data handling beyond import statements. The code is minimal, clean, and standard for a Python module focusing on re-exporting functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is solely responsible for exposing certain functions from an external library. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
