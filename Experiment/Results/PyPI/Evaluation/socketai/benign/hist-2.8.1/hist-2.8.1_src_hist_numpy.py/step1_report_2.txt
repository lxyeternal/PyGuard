{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up re-exporting of specific histogram functions from the boost_histogram.numpy module, likely for simplifying imports in other parts of a project.",
  "sources": "The code imports from __future__ and boost_histogram.numpy, which are static module imports, not dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform any sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing specific functions and defining __all__, with no data processing or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static imports and defines an export list; there are no runtime data flows, no input processing, and no suspicious code behavior. It relies on the boost_histogram.numpy library, which is a third-party dependency. The __future__ import ensures compatibility but does not introduce any security concerns. Overall, this is straightforward module setup code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup for re-exporting histogram functions, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs standard imports and exports with no suspicious elements.",
