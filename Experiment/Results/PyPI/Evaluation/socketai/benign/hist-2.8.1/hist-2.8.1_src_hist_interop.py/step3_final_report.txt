{
  "purpose": "Provides a plugin system for handling histogram data supporting NumPy ndarrays and pandas DataFrames, including registration, unpacking, and broadcasting/flattening routines.",
  "sources": "Class attributes (e.g., dtype.fields), function parameters, object attributes, and data passed to functions like np.asarray() and pd.Series.",
  "sinks": "np.asarray(), np.broadcast_arrays(), pandas to_dict('series') conversions, and data returned from unpack functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects through unpacking or conversion functions, then into broadcasting and flattening routines, with no external communication or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code registers histogram modules for NumPy and pandas, allowing unpacking and broadcasting of structured data. It employs safe, standard data conversion functions (`np.asarray()`, `np.broadcast_arrays()`, pandas to_dict). No network, file, or system modifications are present. Exception handling is used correctly to manage untrusted data inputs. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are observed. The code's purpose is data transformation for histogram support, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data handling utility supporting histogram operations with NumPy and pandas. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
