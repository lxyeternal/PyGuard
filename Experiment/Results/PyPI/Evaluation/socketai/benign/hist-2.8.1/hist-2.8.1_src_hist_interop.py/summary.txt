  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data handling utility supporting histogram operations with NumPy and pandas. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis."
