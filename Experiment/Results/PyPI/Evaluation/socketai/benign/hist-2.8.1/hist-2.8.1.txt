      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard automation script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the potential for command injection via session.posargs, but this is a known and controlled risk in such scripts. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score around 0.2 is justified due to external command execution and dependencies. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use in development workflows."

      "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of eval() in _expr_to_lambda, which can execute arbitrary code if given malicious input. No active malicious activity or backdoors are present. The code is generally safe but should be used cautiously with untrusted input. A malware score of approximately 0.3 and a security risk score of about 0.4 are appropriate to reflect this risk."
