{
  "purpose": "This code extends boost_histogram with visualization, axis management, projection, density calculations, and data manipulation features for scientific histogram analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data during initialization (__init__), data provided via from_columns, fill method, and user-supplied indices for projection and access.",
  "sinks": "Visualization outputs (HTML, SVG), plotting functions, internal data structures, and data returned from methods like density, sum, and profile.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs and external data sources through internal validation, index transformations, and into visualization routines or histogram calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Use of warnings and helper functions are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured extension of a scientific histogram library, with standard features for data handling, plotting, and indexing. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Index wildcards and flexible data input are typical for such tools and do not indicate malicious intent. The extensive safeguards and warnings further suggest a focus on robustness rather than sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, transparent, and free of malicious behavior. It is a standard scientific extension with no signs of sabotage or malware. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified given its flexible data handling but no active threat is present.",
