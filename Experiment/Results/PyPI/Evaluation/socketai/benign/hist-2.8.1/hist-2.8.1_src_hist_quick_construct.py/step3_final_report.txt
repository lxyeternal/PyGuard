  "purpose": "Classes and methods for constructing histograms with various axes and storage options, facilitating flexible data analysis.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, method arguments, axis definitions, data arrays, categories, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No external data output, network transmission, or file I/O; data flows into histogram objects internally.",
  "flows": "Input data and axis configurations flow into histogram object creation via method calls and constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured utility for histogram creation, relying on standard libraries and internal modules. It does not perform any network activity, external data transmission, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The data inputs are controlled via method parameters, and the code's purpose is purely data structure setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard histogram construction utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to data handling but no malicious activity.",
