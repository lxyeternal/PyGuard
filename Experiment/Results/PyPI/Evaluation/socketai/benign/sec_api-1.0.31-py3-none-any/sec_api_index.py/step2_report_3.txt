  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code provides a comprehensive set of classes for interacting with SEC APIs, including filings, legal actions, mappings, and other datasets.\n   - The code uses standard HTTP request patterns with retries and exponential backoff on rate-limiting responses (HTTP 429). URL manipulations with regex are straightforward and primarily for URL formatting.\n   - API keys are included as URL parameters, which is typical but should be protected in deployment.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets (beyond API tokens), or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n   - The code does not perform any system commands, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.\n\n2. **Malware & Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's transparency and straightforward API wrapper nature.\n   - No signs of code obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden backdoors are evident.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Concerns:**\n   - The only minor concern is the exposure of API tokens in URL parameters, which is common but should be handled securely in production environments.\n   - The code relies on external endpoints and user-supplied parameters but does not misuse or mishandle them maliciously.\n   - The retry logic on rate limiting is standard and unlikely to be exploited maliciously.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. No evidence of malware.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. No obfuscation detected.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose as an API client library with no malicious intent, a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate. All reports assign around 0.1-0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Flaws or Logical Errors:**\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the code.\n   - The retry logic is consistent and standard.\n   - The use of regex for URL manipulation appears safe.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified; the code is primarily request wrappers.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify that the code is a standard, transparent API client library.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (low risk, standard API wrapper, minimal exposure of API tokens)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a well-structured, legitimate SDK for SEC data access, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The retry logic and URL handling are standard practices. The low risk score reflects the minimal security concerns inherent in such an API client, primarily related to API token management outside this code scope.",
