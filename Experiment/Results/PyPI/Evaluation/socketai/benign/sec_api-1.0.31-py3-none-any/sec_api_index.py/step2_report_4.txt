  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a structured API client library for SEC data, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. It handles API requests, retries, and URL manipulations in a standard manner.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, primarily due to API key exposure in URLs, which is typical for such clients but should be protected in deployment.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code appears legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions, retries, and URL handling. No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, similar reasoning as above.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is a typical SEC API client with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a well-structured client library for SEC data, with standard request and error handling. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation are evident.  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code clarity is maintained.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to API key handling.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; the code is safe and intended for legitimate data access.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive SDK for SEC data, with standard patterns, no backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic.  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, related to API key exposure.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid; the code is a legitimate client library.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no malicious activity or obfuscation, primarily focused on data retrieval from SEC APIs.  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not contain any malicious payloads, hidden commands, or suspicious network activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, indicating no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), primarily due to the use of API keys in URLs, which is typical but should be protected in production environments.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a set of API client classes for SEC data, with standard request handling, retries, and URL manipulations.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.  \n- The consistent use of retries and URL regex substitutions are standard practices.  \n- The API keys are passed as parameters, which is common, but in deployment, should be secured properly.\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, due to API key handling but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client library for SEC data with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It poses minimal security risk if API keys are managed securely.",
