{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive set of classes for interacting with SEC APIs, enabling retrieval of filings, legal actions, mappings, and other datasets through HTTP requests with retry logic. It acts as a client SDK for SEC data access.",
  "sources": "HTTP POST and GET requests to SEC API endpoints, URL construction with regex substitutions, and input parameters such as query objects or URLs.",
  "sinks": "External network communication with SEC endpoints, response handling, and URL manipulations. No data is written to disk or executed locally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (queries, URLs, tokens) are used to construct API requests; responses are processed and returned as JSON or text content.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets beyond API tokens, and no suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors. URL regex substitutions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client library with classes for different SEC data endpoints. It employs retry logic with exponential backoff on rate-limiting responses (HTTP 429). URL manipulations are simple regex replacements to sanitize or format URLs. API tokens are passed as URL parameters, which is common but should be secured in deployment. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are present. The structure and behavior are typical for such SDKs, with no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK for SEC data access. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to API token handling, which is standard practice. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.",
