  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators of Malware:**\n   - All reports consistently indicate that the code is a straightforward API client wrapper for SEC data endpoints.\n   - No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets (beyond API tokens), or suspicious network activity are detected.\n   - The code performs standard request retries with exponential backoff, which is common in networked API clients.\n   - No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Security Concerns:**\n   - The primary concern noted is the use of API keys in URL parameters, which is typical but should be protected in deployment.\n   - The code does not execute user-supplied code, does not process untrusted data in a malicious way, and does not manipulate data in suspicious manners.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or hidden behaviors are observed.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malware detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.1-0.2), reflecting that API tokens are in URL parameters and could be sensitive if mishandled, but this is standard for such API clients.\n\n4. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent across reports.\n   - The high confidence (0.9) indicates strong agreement among reviewers.\n\n5. **Potential False Positives or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified based solely on the code structure.\n   - The retry logic and URL manipulations are standard and do not suggest malicious behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, at **0.2**, is reasonable given the use of API tokens in URLs, but overall the code is low risk.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a well-structured, standard API client library for SEC data, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minor security concern about API tokens in URLs is typical and manageable with proper deployment practices. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
