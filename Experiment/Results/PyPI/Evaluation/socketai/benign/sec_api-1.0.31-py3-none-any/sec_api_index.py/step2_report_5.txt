  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the underlying code for any signs of malicious activity, and ensure the scoring aligns with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines classes for interacting with SEC APIs, using URL parameters, request payloads, and API keys.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External API requests, responses, and URL manipulations based on user inputs.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No obfuscation, no hidden code, no secrets other than API tokens, which are standard.\n- **Behavior:** Standard API client with retries on rate limiting, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion & Score Justification:** The report assigns malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with API interactions for SEC data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External network requests, URL construction, input parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** Retry logic on 429 responses, URL regex substitutions are straightforward.\n- **Behavior:** No malicious intent or obfuscation, standard API client.\n- **Conclusion & Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API wrappers for SEC data, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Requests to external APIs, with standard URL handling.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets hardcoded.\n- **Behavior:** No signs of malicious activity; primarily data retrieval.\n- **Conclusion & Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, consistent with a legitimate SDK.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, multiple classes for SEC API access.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests, response handling, retries.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** Standard retry/backoff logic, URL regex for URL sanitization.\n- **Behavior:** No malicious code or obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, fitting for a standard API client.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—API classes for SEC data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, data responses.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Behavior:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion & Score Justification:** Malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0).\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected, scores are 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), reflecting typical API client code with exposure to API tokens in URLs, but not inherently risky or malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code is a well-structured, standard SDK for SEC data access, with proper error handling and retries.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — typical API client code with token exposure, but no inherent security risk.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate. The code is safe, legitimate, and does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk is the exposure of API tokens in URL parameters, which is standard but should be protected in deployment.",
