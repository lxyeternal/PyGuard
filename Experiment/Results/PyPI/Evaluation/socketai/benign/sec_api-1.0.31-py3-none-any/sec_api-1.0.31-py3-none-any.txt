      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static import statements for SEC API classes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the negligible risk posed by static imports."

The security risk is minimal and primarily related to API token handling, which is standard practice. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified."
