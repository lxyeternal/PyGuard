{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules from the 'sec_api.index' package, likely to access securities and financial data APIs for data retrieval and analysis.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statements from 'sec_api.index', which loads multiple API classes from an external package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists here; the code only imports classes and functions without any runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code exclusively contains import statements with no additional logic, code injection, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports multiple classes from an external package 'sec_api.index'. All imports are straightforward, without dynamic imports, code execution, or any embedded malicious code. No sensitive data handling, network activity, or side effects are observed. The code appears to be a standard setup for using the sec_api library, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily performing static imports of various API classes for subsequent use. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected in this snippet.",
