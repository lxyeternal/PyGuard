{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various classes from the sec_api.index module, likely to be used for accessing SEC data APIs.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning of the script that load multiple classes from the sec_api.index package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only imports classes without executing or invoking methods.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow is established as the code only contains imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various classes from the sec_api.index package, presumably to be used later in the program for SEC data retrieval and processing. There are no functions, method calls, or data manipulations present. The imports appear straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network communication, or credential handling. The code is structural and preparatory, serving as setup for subsequent operations.",
  "conclusion": "This script is purely composed of import statements without execution of any potentially malicious code. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate setup for SEC API data access, with no signs of supply chain attack vectors.",
