  "purpose": "Static import statements for various SEC API classes from the sec_api.index package, likely for use in financial data retrieval and analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sec_api.index module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no execution or data flow occurs in this code snippet",
  "flows": "None; static imports only, no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static import statements from a known package, with no functions, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The imports are from a reputable source and are typical for setting up API access. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the clarity of the code. The security risk score is minimal, around 0 or 0.05, since static imports generally pose negligible risk unless the modules execute malicious code upon import, which cannot be inferred here. The scores assigned in the original reports are consistent with this analysis, though a slight reduction in the risk score from 0.1 to 0 would be more precise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static import statements for SEC API classes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the negligible risk posed by static imports.",
