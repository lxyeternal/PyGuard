  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Findings from Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static import statements from the 'sec_api.index' package.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is observed.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The code appears to be a setup for accessing various SEC-related APIs, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points to consider:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the static nature of the code. Importing modules alone does not inherently execute malicious code unless those modules run code upon import, which cannot be determined from this snippet. However, since the modules are from a presumably reputable 'sec_api' package, and no suspicious patterns are observed, this is unlikely.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**  \n   The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n\n3. **Security Risk Scores:**  \n   The security risk score varies slightly, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the absence of any dynamic or insecure patterns, this is likely an overestimate. The scores of 0.1 are minimal and probably reflect a conservative approach to static imports, but they are not justified by any actual vulnerability.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   No reason exists to assign a risk higher than 0.1 based solely on static imports. The lack of execution, data flow, or suspicious patterns suggests the risk is negligible.\n\n5. **Potential for Hidden Malicious Behavior in Modules:**  \n   While modules could execute code at import time, there's no evidence here. If the modules are well-maintained and from a trusted source, this risk is minimal.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The security risk score should be adjusted to 0 or a very minimal value (e.g., 0.05) to reflect the benign nature of static imports.\n- The scores assigned in report 5 (securityRisk=0.1) seem slightly high; I would recommend lowering this to 0.\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or at most 0.05)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign static import block for various SEC API classes. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behavior is evident from this snippet. The existing scores are reasonable but could be slightly lowered for the security risk metric.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways verify the trustworthiness of the imported modules themselves, especially if their source or maintenance status is uncertain. But based solely on this code snippet, no security concerns are justified.",
