{
  "purpose": "The code builds and manages a dependency graph for functions, resolving dependencies using a topological sort, with support for asynchronous and synchronous contexts, and integration with FastAPI dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function signatures, type hints, class attributes, and external dependencies such as FastAPI's Depends.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to injection if external inputs influence dependency resolution, but mainly used for internal dependency management; no direct data leaks or malicious outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Dependency definitions and type hints are read as sources; dependency resolution and dependency graph building are the main flows; dependencies are replaced, and the dependency order is established via topological sort.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. The code uses warnings for unresolved type hints, but this is standard practice. No obfuscated language features or unnecessary dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dependency graph construction and resolution for functions, with detailed handling of type hints, generics, and FastAPI integrations. It uses standard Python features like inspect, warnings, and collections. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only noteworthy aspect is the flexibility in dependency replacement and dynamic type resolution, which is common in dependency injection frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a dependency management utility without any malicious intent or malicious code. It adheres to standard practices for dependency resolution and type hint analysis. There are no indications of malware or malicious behavior, and the security risk is minimal.",
