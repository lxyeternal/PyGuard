{
  "purpose": "Define dependency injection mechanism for a task management system, allowing dependencies to be declared and managed with optional caching.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (inspect, uuid, collections.abc, contextlib, types, typing) and defines functions and classes related to dependency handling.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code sets up dependency structures without processing external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions and classes for dependency injection, involving type hints, UUIDs for dependency identification, and class methods for comparison and representation. There are overloads for the Depends function, which facilitates flexible dependency declarations. The use of uuid ensures unique dependency identification. All code appears to be standard and does not perform any malicious actions, data manipulation, or system calls outside normal object management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of dependency injection utilities without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, it is safe and designed for dependency management within a larger system.",
