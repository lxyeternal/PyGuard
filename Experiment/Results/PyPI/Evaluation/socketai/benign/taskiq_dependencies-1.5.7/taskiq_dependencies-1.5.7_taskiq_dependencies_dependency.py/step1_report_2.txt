{
  "purpose": "This code defines a dependency injection mechanism, allowing functions or classes to be marked as dependencies for use in larger applications, typically for managing dependencies in a framework or system.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via function parameters, environment variables (indirectly via dependency parameters), and module attributes. It also generates UUIDs for Dependency instances.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include returning Dependency objects, string representations, and UUIDs. There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs in a harmful manner.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through function parameters into Dependency instances, which are then used for dependency resolution. UUIDs are generated for identification, but these are not malicious. The flow appears typical for dependency management.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code does not perform network operations, file system modifications, or use environment variables in a suspicious way. The use of UUIDs is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a dependency injection pattern with multiple overloads for type hinting, returning Dependency objects that store references to dependencies. It uses standard libraries and constructs, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident; the code is straightforward in implementing dependency markers and constructors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a dependency injection pattern without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. It might be part of a larger framework, but on its own, it poses no security threats.",
