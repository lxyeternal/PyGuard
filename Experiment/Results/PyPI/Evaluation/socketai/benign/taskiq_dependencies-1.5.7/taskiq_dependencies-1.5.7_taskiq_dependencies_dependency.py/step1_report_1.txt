{
  "purpose": "The code defines dependency injection utilities for a framework, including functions and classes to manage dependencies with support for type hints, caching, and nested dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameters passed to functions, such as 'dependency', 'use_cache', and 'kwargs'. It also uses the 'inspect' module to analyze function signatures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or system effects are present. The code does not perform network operations, file operations, or system commands. It mainly constructs dependency objects and manages internal state.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are created via the 'Depends' function, which returns 'Dependency' objects. These objects are used internally to manage dependency resolution, with no data flowing from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive use of type overloading and advanced Python features such as uuid generation, and relies heavily on type hints and internal object identities. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a dependency injection utility, establishing dependencies with options for caching and parameterization. It uses uuid for internal object identity management, and the 'inspect' module for potential signature analysis. No code indicates network access, file manipulation, or other malicious actions. No suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert channels are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard dependency management implementation for a framework, with no malicious or suspicious components. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain any hidden backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
