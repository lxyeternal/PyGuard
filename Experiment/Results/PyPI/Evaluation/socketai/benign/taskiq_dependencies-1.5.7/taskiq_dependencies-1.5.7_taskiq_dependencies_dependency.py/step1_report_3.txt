{
  "purpose": "Defines dependency injection utilities and a Dependency class for managing dependencies with optional caching and metadata.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input directly. It constructs dependency objects and defines type overloads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no external data handling or output based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static class and function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution. No obfuscated code or signs of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a dependency injection mechanism with type hints, including a Dependency class that manages dependencies with unique identifiers. It uses UUIDs for object identity, and the functions are straightforward, focused on dependency creation and management. No external data is processed, and no sensitive information is accessed or transmitted. The structure appears typical for dependency management in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dependency injection utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger dependency resolution system, with no malicious or suspicious features.",
