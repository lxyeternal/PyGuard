{
  "purpose": "Provides dependency injection utilities, including a Depends function and Dependency class, for managing dependencies with type hints and caching.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (dependency, use_cache, kwargs), internal UUIDs, inspect.signature",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or file operations; internal object creation only",
  "flows": "Input parameters into Dependency objects; internal UUID and signature management",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code defines dependency management utilities with type overloads, UUID-based identity, and use of inspect for signatures. It contains no network, file, or system calls, nor external data handling. The structure is standard, with no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores and assessments are justified and appropriate.",
