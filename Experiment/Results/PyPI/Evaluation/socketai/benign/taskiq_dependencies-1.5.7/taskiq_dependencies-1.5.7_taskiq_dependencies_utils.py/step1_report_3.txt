{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and a class for inspecting and handling context managers and dependency parameter information within a larger dependency graph framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (inspect, sys, contextlib, typing) and class definitions. Reads no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could leak data or perform harmful actions. Functions mainly perform type checks and class attribute inspections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The functions operate on object types and class hierarchies, with no network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard library functions and well-known patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining helper functions for type guarding of context managers and a simple class to store parameter info. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. All functions are purely for type and class hierarchy checks, which are safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for internal use within a dependency graph framework. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
