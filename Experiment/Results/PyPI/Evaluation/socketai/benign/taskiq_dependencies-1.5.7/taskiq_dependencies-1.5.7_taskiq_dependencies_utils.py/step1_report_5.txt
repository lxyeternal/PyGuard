  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for inspecting and managing context managers and dependency parameters in a larger dependency graph system.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys module for version checking; input parameters like 'name' and 'graph' in class initialization; TYPE_CHECKING for conditional import; inspecting object types in iscontextmanager and isasynccontextmanager functions.",
  "sinks": "TypeGuard return statements in iscontextmanager and isasynccontextmanager functions, which perform runtime type checks using issubclass.",
  "flows": "Input objects passed to iscontextmanager or isasynccontextmanager are checked for their class inheritance to determine if they are context managers.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard Python features and typing constructs without any obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class ParamInfo for storing parameter metadata related to dependency graphs, including optional signature info. It also includes two functions, iscontextmanager and isasynccontextmanager, which determine whether a given object is a synchronous or asynchronous context manager by checking class inheritance from internal context manager classes. The imports and code structure appear standard, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. All operations are straightforward type checks and data storage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for dependency inspection and context manager identification with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It uses standard Python practices without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
