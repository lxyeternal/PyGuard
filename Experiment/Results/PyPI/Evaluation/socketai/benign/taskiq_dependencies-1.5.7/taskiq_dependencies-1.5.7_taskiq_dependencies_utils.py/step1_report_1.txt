  "purpose": "Define utility functions and classes for dependency parameter info and type checks for context managers.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (inspect, sys, contextlib, typing), and class/function definitions reading no external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or execute code with external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; functions are purely type-checking helpers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type checking utilities and a class for dependency parameter info. It uses standard library functions and classes, with conditional imports based on Python version. The functions 'iscontextmanager' and 'isasynccontextmanager' determine whether objects are context managers by inspecting their class hierarchy, which is standard practice. No external data inputs, external commands, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, focused on type checking and utility class definitions for dependency management. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected.",
