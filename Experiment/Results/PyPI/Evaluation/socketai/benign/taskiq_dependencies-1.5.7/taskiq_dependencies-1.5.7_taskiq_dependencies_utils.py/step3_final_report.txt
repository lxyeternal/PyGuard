{
  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for dependency parameter information and context manager type identification within a dependency graph framework.",
  "sources": "The functions 'iscontextmanager' and 'isasynccontextmanager' read the class of 'obj' to determine its type; the 'ParamInfo' class stores dependency parameter details.",
  "sinks": "The 'issubclass' checks on 'obj.__class__' could be misused if 'obj' is untrusted, potentially leading to misuse or exploitation in untrusted contexts.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' flows into 'issubclass' checks to determine if it is a context manager; no external data or network flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'issubclass(obj.__class__, ...)' without validation of 'obj' could be considered a minor anomaly if 'obj' is from an untrusted source, but this is a common pattern in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for dependency parameter info and two functions for type checking of context managers. The functions rely on class hierarchy checks, which are standard but could be misused if 'obj' is untrusted. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or external data handling are present. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or security flaws. The potential risk stems from the pattern used, but in typical controlled environments, this is safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1) due to the pattern's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and employs standard Python practices for dependency info and type checking. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The minor concern about 'issubclass' usage is acknowledged but does not constitute a real threat in typical use cases.",
