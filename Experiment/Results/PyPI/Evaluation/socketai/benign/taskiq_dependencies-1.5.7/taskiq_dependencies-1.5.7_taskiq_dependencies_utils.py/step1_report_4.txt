{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and a class for managing dependency information and identifying context managers within a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (inspect, sys, contextlib, typing) and class parameters such as name, graph, and signature.",
  "sinks": "The functions iscontextmanager and isasynccontextmanager perform type checks on objects to determine if they are context managers, which could influence control flow but do not directly lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input objects passed to iscontextmanager or isasynccontextmanager are checked against class hierarchies. No untrusted data flows to external systems or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code performs standard type checking and class inheritance checks. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class ParamInfo for dependency parameter information and two functions for checking context manager types. It uses safe, standard Python library functions for introspection and type guards. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident. All imports are standard, and functions perform legitimate type checks. No network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate utility module intended for dependency management and context manager identification. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe for use.",
