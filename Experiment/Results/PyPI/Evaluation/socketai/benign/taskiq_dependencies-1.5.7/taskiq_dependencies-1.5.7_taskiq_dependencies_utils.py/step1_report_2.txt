{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes to analyze and represent dependency information, as well as identify context managers and async context managers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include imported modules (inspect, sys, contextlib, typing), and the 'obj' parameter passed to the functions 'iscontextmanager' and 'isasynccontextmanager'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points are the use of 'issubclass' checks on 'obj.__class__', which could be influenced by untrusted input if the 'obj' is externally provided and not validated elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input 'obj' flows into 'issubclass' calls to determine context manager type; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward and relies on standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions for dependency metadata and context manager type checking. It uses 'issubclass' on 'obj.__class__' to determine if an object is a context manager, which is a common pattern. The presence of type hints and version-dependent imports appear normal. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or hidden functionality. The code operates purely within standard, safe programming practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for dependency analysis and context manager identification. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'issubclass' on 'obj.__class__' could theoretically be exploited if 'obj' is from an untrusted source, but this pattern is common and not inherently malicious.",
