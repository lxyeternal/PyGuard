{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for resolving dependencies within a dependency graph, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous contexts. It manages traversal, resolution, and cleanup of dependencies, including context managers and generators.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from dependency graphs, dependencies, parameters, and initial cache inputs. It also inspects functions and context managers for execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include executing untrusted functions, calling context managers, and iterating over generators or async generators, which could lead to code execution if dependencies are malicious or untrusted.",
  "flows": "Sources such as dependency graph dependencies and initial cache flow into resolver methods, which execute dependency functions, context managers, or generators. Resolved results flow back into the graph resolution process, with cleanup performed during exit routines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. Usage of standard dependency resolution with generators, async functions, and context managers appears normal. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a dependency resolution framework that traverses a dependency graph, executing functions, generators, and context managers to resolve dependencies asynchronously or synchronously. It properly manages cleanup via close methods, handles exceptions, and uses standard Python features for dependency management. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are evident. Usage patterns are typical for dependency injection frameworks, with no unusual or suspicious code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate dependency resolution framework with standard features and no malicious intent. It handles dependency traversal, resolution, and cleanup securely and correctly, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
