{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for a dependencies package used for dependency injection in Python projects, mainly by importing and exposing specific classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'taskiq_dependencies' package modules: 'dependency', 'graph', and 'utils'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules through the package's classes and functions; no external or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an initializer or facade, exposing specific classes from a dependency injection package. It only imports classes from other modules and defines __all__, with no runtime logic, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initializer for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply re-exports classes for external use, with no suspicious features.",
