  "purpose": "This package provides dependency injection utilities for Python projects, facilitating dependency management and graph building.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes from the 'taskiq_dependencies' package modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing, no untrusted data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to critical functions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code is straightforward, importing modules and defining __all__.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, serving as a package interface. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The imports are from a presumably trusted dependency module. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package interface file, merely re-exporting classes for external use. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
