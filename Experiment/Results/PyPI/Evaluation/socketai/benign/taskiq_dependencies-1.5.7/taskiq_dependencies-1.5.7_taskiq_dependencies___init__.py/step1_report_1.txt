{
  "purpose": "The code provides imports and exports for a dependency injection package used in Python projects.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own static content and imported modules; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely defining imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes from an external package related to dependency injection, and defines the __all__ variable for exports. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or dynamic execution. The comments and structure indicate straightforward package setup code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard module initializer for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
