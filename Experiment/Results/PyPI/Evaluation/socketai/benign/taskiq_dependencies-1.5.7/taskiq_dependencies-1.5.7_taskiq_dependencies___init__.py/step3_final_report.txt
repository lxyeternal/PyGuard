  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the taskiq dependencies package by importing and re-exporting key classes.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'taskiq_dependencies' modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no runtime data flow, only static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports specific classes from an external package and defines __all__ for export. It contains no dynamic behavior, user input, network activity, or data processing. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module serving as an API surface for a dependency injection package. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
