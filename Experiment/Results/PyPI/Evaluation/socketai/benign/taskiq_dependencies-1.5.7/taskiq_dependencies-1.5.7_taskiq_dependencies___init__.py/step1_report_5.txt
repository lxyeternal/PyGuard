{
  "purpose": "This package provides dependency injection utilities for Python projects, facilitating dependency management and injection.",
  "sources": "The code reads from its own import statements and the module docstring. No external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network, file, or environment variable operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are evident in this static code snippet, as it primarily contains imports and a docstring.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, consisting of only documentation, import statements, and an __all__ declaration. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a module that re-exports certain classes and functions from the 'taskiq_dependencies' package. It includes a descriptive docstring, which does not perform any operations. All statements are standard Python import and metadata declarations, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks in this snippet. It appears to be a benign, standard module setup for a dependency injection package.",
