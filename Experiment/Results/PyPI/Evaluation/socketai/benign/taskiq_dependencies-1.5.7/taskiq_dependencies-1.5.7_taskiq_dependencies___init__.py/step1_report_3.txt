{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package module for dependency injection, exposing specific classes and utilities for use in other projects.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'taskiq_dependencies' package modules: 'dependency', 'graph', and 'utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from an external package and defines the public API via __all__. It does not contain dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond imports. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for a package's init module.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple module initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as an API definition for dependency injection utilities and does not perform any harmful operations.",
