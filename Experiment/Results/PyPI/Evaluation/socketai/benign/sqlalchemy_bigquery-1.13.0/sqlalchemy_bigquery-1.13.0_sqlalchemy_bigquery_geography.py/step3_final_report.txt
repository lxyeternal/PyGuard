{
  "purpose": "Defines custom geographic data wrapper classes (WKB, WKT) and a GEOGRAPHY type for use with SQLAlchemy and BigQuery, enabling spatial data handling and conversions.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, properties (wkt, wkb), bind_processor method, and custom compilation functions that process data and SQL function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data converted into WKT/WKB formats for database insertion; no external data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through class constructors into internal representations, then via bind_processor into database parameters, and through custom SQL compilation into BigQuery spatial functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and standard for spatial data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom spatial data types and function compilation for BigQuery, with proper inheritance, data conversion methods, and SQLAlchemy integration. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flow is straightforward, involving safe conversions and SQL function overrides. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to data format handling, which is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension for spatial data handling in SQLAlchemy for BigQuery, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard data conversion and function customization without vulnerabilities.",
