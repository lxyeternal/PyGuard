{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom SQLAlchemy type for BigQuery STRUCT/RECORD data, enabling schema representation and attribute access within SQLAlchemy ORM.",
  "sources": "Type initialization with field definitions, class methods for SQL compilation and attribute access, placeholder function 'struct_getitem_op'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; internal SQL string generation and attribute access.",
  "flows": "Type constructor → get_col_spec method → attribute access via Comparator → placeholder 'struct_getitem_op' (not implemented).",
  "anomalies": "The 'struct_getitem_op' function raises NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete implementation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom SQLAlchemy type for BigQuery STRUCTs, with methods for representation, SQL compilation, and attribute access. The placeholder function suggests ongoing development but does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source extension for BigQuery support in SQLAlchemy. The incomplete placeholder does not pose security concerns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, and the scoring is appropriate.",
