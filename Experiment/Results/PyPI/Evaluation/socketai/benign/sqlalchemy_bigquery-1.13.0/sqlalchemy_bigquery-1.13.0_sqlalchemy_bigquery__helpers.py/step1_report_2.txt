{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create and configure a Google BigQuery client with optional credentials and user agent customization.",
  "sources": "Reads input from optional parameters such as credentials_info, credentials_path, credentials_base64, project_id, and user_agent.",
  "sinks": "Uses the input parameters to create a BigQuery client object; does not directly perform any data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Credentials data (base64-decoded, file-based, or default) flow into the credentials creation functions, then into the bigquery.Client constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Regex functions provide dynamic replacements but are standard utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles credentials via safe libraries and optional parameters. It decodes base64 credentials, reads from files, or defaults to Google authentication. The regex functions facilitate pattern-based string replacements but do not execute arbitrary code. No suspicious network activity or malicious behaviors are present. All data flows are typical for SDK client setup; no hardcoded credentials or data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility for creating a BigQuery client with flexible credential options. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The functions perform safe operations aligned with typical SDK usage.",
