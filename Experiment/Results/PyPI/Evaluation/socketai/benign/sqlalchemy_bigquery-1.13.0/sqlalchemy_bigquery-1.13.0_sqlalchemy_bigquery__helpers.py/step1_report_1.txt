  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for creating Google BigQuery clients with flexible credential options and regex substitution helpers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as credentials_info, credentials_path, credentials_base64, user_agent, project_id, location, and regex patterns in substitute_re_method and substitute_string_re_method.",
  "sinks": "Credentials loading from potentially untrusted sources, regex substitution functions.",
  "flows": "Credentials data flow from input parameters to credentials object creation; regex patterns compile and are used in substitution functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of credentials_base64 and credentials_path without validation could lead to loading malicious credentials if supplied by untrusted sources. Regex functions are flexible but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code facilitates secure interaction with Google BigQuery by supporting multiple credential input methods, including JSON info, file path, and base64 encoding, with scope restrictions. The regex functions are standard utility wrappers, not malicious. No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. The credential handling is flexible but depends on trusted inputs; potential risk if credentials are supplied from untrusted sources, but no malicious intent detected within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is primarily utility functions for client creation and regex substitution, with no malicious behavior. The credential handling is flexible and potentially risky if used improperly, but it does not contain malicious intent or malware. No security risks or anomalies are detected within this module.",
