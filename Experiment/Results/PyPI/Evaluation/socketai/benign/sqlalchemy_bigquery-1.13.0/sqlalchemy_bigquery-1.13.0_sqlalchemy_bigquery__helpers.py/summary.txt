  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for BigQuery client setup and regex string manipulation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is the handling of untrusted credential inputs, which is a standard risk rather than malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting potential misuse if inputs are untrusted but not indicating any inherent security flaw."
