  "sources": "Credentials from parameters (info, path, base64), environment (default credentials), regex pattern strings.",
  "sinks": "Credentials loading functions, regex substitution functions applied to input strings.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (credentials info/path/base64) flow into credential creation; regex patterns compile and generate substitution functions applied to strings.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of untrusted credential sources (base64, file), but no malicious code or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code handles credentials securely using standard libraries and practices, with flexible options for credential input. Regex helpers are benign wrappers for pattern substitution. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The credential inputs could be misused if supplied from untrusted sources, but this is a common risk in credential management utilities, not malicious behavior. The regex functions are safe and do not execute arbitrary code. Overall, the code is a legitimate utility module for Google Cloud BigQuery client creation, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility for BigQuery client setup and regex string manipulation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is the handling of untrusted credential inputs, which is a standard risk rather than malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting potential misuse if inputs are untrusted but not indicating any inherent security flaw.",
