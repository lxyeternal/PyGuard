{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions and type mappings for handling BigQuery schemas in SQLAlchemy, including schema field extraction and column type conversions.",
  "sources": "The code reads schema field data from input objects such as 'bq_schema', and from methods like 'SchemaField.from_api_repr'. It also attempts to import 'GEOGRAPHY' and 'geography' module conditionally.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or send data; it constructs and returns schema-related information and warnings. No direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input schema objects are processed through recursive functions to extract fields and convert types, with type mappings and conditional logic determining column types. No external data flow or untrusted input to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The only notable feature is the conditional import of 'geography' module, which is standard. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or unusual operations are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward schema handling utility for BigQuery and SQLAlchemy integration. It defines type mappings, recursively extracts nested fields, and converts schema information into SQLAlchemy column types. The use of warnings for unrecognized types is benign. No external system calls, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code adheres to standard patterns and includes necessary error handling for missing types.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module for schema handling with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It effectively maps BigQuery schema fields to SQLAlchemy types and handles nested schemas without executing any harmful operations.",
