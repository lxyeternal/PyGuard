{
  "purpose": "The code maps BigQuery schema types to SQLAlchemy types, processes schema fields recursively, and handles nested structures for schema translation.",
  "sources": "The code reads schema field attributes such as field_type, mode, precision, scale, max_length, description, and nested fields within the schema objects.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code processes schema representations internally without external input/output operations.",
  "flows": "Schema fields are read from the input schema object, and their attributes are used to determine SQLAlchemy column types; nested fields are recursively processed to build complex types.",
  "anomalies": "The only benign warning is issued when an unrecognized type is encountered, which is standard practice and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for translating BigQuery schema definitions into SQLAlchemy column definitions. It imports libraries securely, handles nested schemas recursively, and issues warnings for unknown types. No external data is processed in an unsafe manner, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The logic is clear, and the functions serve well-defined purposes aligned with schema translation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard schema translation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The warnings for unrecognized types are benign and do not indicate any malicious activity. The overall security posture is very safe.",
