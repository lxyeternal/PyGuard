{
  "purpose": "The code provides mappings and functions to convert BigQuery schema fields into SQLAlchemy column types, including recursive processing of nested schema fields.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (sqlalchemy, google.cloud.bigquery.schema), and accesses schema field attributes such as field_type, mode, precision, scale, max_length, description, and nested fields.",
  "sinks": "None apparent. No untrusted data is written or sent over network or to system resources.",
  "flows": "Schema fields are retrieved and processed recursively to generate column definitions. Data flows from schema representation to SQLAlchemy types via internal functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Warnings for unrecognized types are benign and only notify the user.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary libraries and defines mappings for various BigQuery data types to SQLAlchemy types. It includes error handling for missing imports and unrecognized types, with warnings issued for unknown types. Recursive functions process nested schema fields, converting them into SQLAlchemy-compatible column definitions. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The overall structure is standard for schema translation utilities, with safe practices observed. No malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate schema translation utility for BigQuery schemas to SQLAlchemy types. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It uses standard patterns and handles errors gracefully without security concerns.",
