  "purpose": "Helper function to retrieve the Python runtime version as a tuple of major, minor, micro.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data handling issues present",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → extract_runtime_version() return value",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines a single function that extracts the Python interpreter's version information. It accesses sys.version_info, which is a safe, standard way to retrieve runtime version data. The function returns a tuple of three integers, with no data manipulation or external calls beyond standard library. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code. Overall, the code performs a benign task and adheres to expected practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for fetching Python version info, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is well-structured, clear, and safe.",
