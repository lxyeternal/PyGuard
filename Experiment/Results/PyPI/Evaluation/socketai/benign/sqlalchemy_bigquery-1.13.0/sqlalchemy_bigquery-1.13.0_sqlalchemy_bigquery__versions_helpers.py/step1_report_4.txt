  "purpose": "Provide helper functions to verify the installed Python module versions, specifically extracting the runtime Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads runtime Python version information)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "Extraction of sys.version_info (source) directly used to return version tuple (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines a function to extract the current Python runtime version. It accesses sys.version_info to obtain major, minor, and micro version numbers, then returns them as a tuple. The code is straightforward, clean, and lacks any suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. The code's purpose is solely for version checking, which is common and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard, benign operation of retrieving Python version info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
