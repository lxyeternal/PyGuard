  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the reports and the code to determine if there are any security concerns, anomalies, or inconsistencies.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware:**\n   - All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward utility that extracts Python version info via `sys.version_info`.\n   - There are no external data transmissions, network calls, or data leaks.\n   - The code does not perform any obfuscated operations, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic.\n   - The license and comments are standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Potential Flaws:**\n   - The code is simple, direct, and adheres to best practices for version extraction.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The extraction of version info from `sys.version_info` is safe and standard.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n   - **Confidence:** 1, as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations:**\n   - No issues or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations or handle untrusted data.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple, legitimate utility function with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free of security concerns.",
