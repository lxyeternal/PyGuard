  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or external data transmission",
  "flows": "Input from sys.version_info → extraction of major, minor, micro → return tuple",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version extraction function with no obfuscated or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines a function that reads sys.version_info to extract Python runtime version numbers, and returns them as a tuple. There are no external inputs beyond sys.version_info, which is controlled by the Python environment. No data leaks, no code injection, no suspicious logic. The license and comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate utility function for extracting Python runtime version information. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
