  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions to verify the Python runtime version of the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from sys.version_info to determine Python version details.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send untrusted data anywhere; it merely processes version info internally.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> extract_runtime_version() function (retrieves and returns version info).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code present. The code performs straightforward version extraction.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and uses sys.version_info to obtain the current Python interpreter's version components. It then returns these as a tuple. The function is simple, intended for version verification. There are no data leaks, network operations, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for retrieving Python version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
