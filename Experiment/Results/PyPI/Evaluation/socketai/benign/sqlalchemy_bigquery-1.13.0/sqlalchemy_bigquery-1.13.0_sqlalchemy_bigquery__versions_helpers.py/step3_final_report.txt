  "purpose": "Extracts the Python interpreter's major, minor, and micro version numbers from sys.version_info.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info attribute",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "Direct access from sys.version_info to return statement",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code accesses sys.version_info to retrieve the current Python version components and returns them as a tuple. It does not handle external inputs, perform network activity, or manipulate data in a suspicious manner. The code is simple, well-structured, and uses standard library features without obfuscation or malicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is a common utility function, and it does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for retrieving Python version info. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns are present. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and appropriate.",
