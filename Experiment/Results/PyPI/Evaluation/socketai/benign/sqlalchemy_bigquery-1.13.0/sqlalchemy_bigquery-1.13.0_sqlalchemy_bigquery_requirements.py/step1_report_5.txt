{
  "purpose": "Defines database feature support requirements and capabilities for testing database compatibility, specifically for BigQuery in SQLAlchemy.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy.testing.requirements and sqlalchemy.testing.exclusions; class property methods returning support/unsupported status.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to critical sinks; mainly property methods returning static values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected. The code strictly defines feature support status without executing untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes static property methods indicating support or lack thereof for various database features. It imports necessary modules for test requirements and exclusions. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or network communication is present. The code structure is straightforward, using properties to return fixed boolean values. There are no obfuscated code patterns or indications of malicious intent. All methods serve as feature flags for database capabilities. The only notable aspect is the completeness and explicitness of feature support declarations, which align with typical testing framework setups, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard configuration for database capability requirements, with no malicious or suspicious code detected. It does not process or transmit untrusted data and is solely for defining support features for testing purposes.",
