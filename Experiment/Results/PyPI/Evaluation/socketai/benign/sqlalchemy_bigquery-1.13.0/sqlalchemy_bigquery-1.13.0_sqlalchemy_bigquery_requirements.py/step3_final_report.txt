{
  "purpose": "This module defines support and unsupported features for database capabilities used in testing database compatibility with BigQuery, serving as a static configuration.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static property methods returning support flags.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static support flag returns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static property definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module with class properties indicating support or unsupported features for database testing. It contains no dynamic code, external input handling, network activity, or malicious patterns. The functions like 'supported()' and 'unsupported()' are likely simple boolean-returning functions, standard in such configuration contexts. The code's purpose is purely declarative, serving as feature flags for testing database capabilities. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module that declares support for various database features. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
