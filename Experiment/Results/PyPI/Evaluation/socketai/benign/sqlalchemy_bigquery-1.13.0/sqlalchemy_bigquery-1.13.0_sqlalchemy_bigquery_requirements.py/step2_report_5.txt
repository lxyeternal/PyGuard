  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report to identify any issues, inconsistencies, or potential risks.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static configuration module that defines support/unsupported features for database capabilities.\n- The code primarily consists of class properties returning fixed support status via functions like `supported()` and `unsupported()`.\n- No external data input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears well-structured, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior noted.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  No issues are present in the code. It does not perform any malicious actions or process untrusted data.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n  The reports correctly interpret the code as a benign configuration module. They recognize the static nature of the properties and the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis per Report:\n\n**Report 1-5:**\n- The descriptions are consistent, noting that the code is a straightforward feature support declaration with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The confidence scores are high (1.0), which is justified.\n- The malware scores are 0, correctly indicating no malware.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- The security risks are correctly scored as 0.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Points of Clarification:**\n- The reports mention functions like `supported()` and `unsupported()`. These are likely simple functions returning boolean or support status. Their definitions are not included, but given the context, they are standard in such configuration modules.\n- The code does not include any dynamic or external data processing, which supports the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be very low (around 0), given the lack of security issues.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal risk associated with static configuration code, but practically negligible)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The static nature of the code, the absence of external inputs, and the lack of dynamic behavior support this conclusion.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, with scores reflecting no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk. No changes are necessary.",
