{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of database requirements and capabilities for use in testing or compatibility checks with SQLAlchemy and BigQuery.",
  "sources": "The code reads static property definitions and configuration flags within class attributes. No external inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle sensitive information.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code primarily sets static properties indicating support or lack thereof for features.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and primarily consists of property definitions returning fixed support/unsupported values. No anomalies or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules, defines classes with property methods indicating support or unsupported features for various SQL features. These properties return static values and do not perform any dynamic or malicious operations. The code appears to serve as a configuration or capability declaration for testing purposes. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. It does not read or write external data, perform network operations, or execute any untrusted code. The code is well-structured, standard, and intended for feature support indication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module that specifies supported or unsupported database features for testing compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves a purely informational and structural purpose within a testing framework.",
