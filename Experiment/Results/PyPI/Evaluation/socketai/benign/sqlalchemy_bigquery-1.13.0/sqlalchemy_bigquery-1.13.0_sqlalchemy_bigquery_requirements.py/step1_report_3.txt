{
  "purpose": "This module defines database feature requirements and support status for testing database capabilities in the context of SQLAlchemy and BigQuery integration.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only from imported modules and class property calls; it does not process external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or other security issues. The code does not write or execute external commands or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code mainly defines static properties and constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of class definitions with properties indicating support or lack thereof for various database features. There are no unusual code behaviors, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static configuration module, mainly defining support statuses for various database features via class properties. It imports standard modules and uses property decorators to return boolean values indicating support or lack of support for specific features. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, input processing, or output generation. The purpose is configuration and capability description, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration file used for testing database capabilities, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply indicates support or lack of support for various features. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious code elements are present.",
