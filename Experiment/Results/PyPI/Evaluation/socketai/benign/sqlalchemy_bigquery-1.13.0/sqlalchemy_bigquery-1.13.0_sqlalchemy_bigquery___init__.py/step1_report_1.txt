  "purpose": "Provide a SQLAlchemy dialect for Google BigQuery, facilitating database interactions and compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and optional external modules; version extraction functions.",
  "sinks": "Warnings related to Python version deprecation and obsolete package detection; no untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports dependencies, issues warnings based on runtime conditions, and extends module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs module setup and version warnings without handling user input or data that could lead to vulnerabilities. Import statements are from local modules and optional third-party packages. The only runtime behavior involves issuing warnings based on environment conditions, not executing untrusted code or network operations. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The warnings about package support and deprecated packages are standard and benign. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup module for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly manages imports and environment warnings without handling untrusted input or executing harmful actions.",
