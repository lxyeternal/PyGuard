{
  "purpose": "Display a list of files in the current directory with their sizes.",
  "sources": "os.listdir('.') to read directory contents, os.stat(n).st_size to get file sizes",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data is sent over the network or used insecurely",
  "flows": "os.listdir('.') -> os.stat(n).st_size; input data flows from directory listing to display output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code simply lists files and their sizes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a class to list files, and retrieves filenames and sizes from the current directory. No external inputs beyond standard directory listing are used. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The use of os.listdir and os.stat is typical for file management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic directory listing without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility for displaying files and their sizes.",
