  "purpose": "Display a list of files in the current directory with their sizes.",
  "sources": "os.listdir('.') to read directory contents, os.stat(n) to get file sizes",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; simply listing files and sizes from local directory",
  "flows": "os.listdir('.') -> os.stat(n) for each file to gather size information",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a third-party library (cliff.lister). It defines a class to list directory contents, printing file names and sizes. There are no suspicious functions, no network calls, no data leaks, and no credential handling. The implementation is straightforward, using standard library functions without any anomalies or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple file lister with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and intended for normal use.",
