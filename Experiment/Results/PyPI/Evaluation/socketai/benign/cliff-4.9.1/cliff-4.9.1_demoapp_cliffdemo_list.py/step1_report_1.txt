  "purpose": "Display a list of files in the current directory with their sizes.",
  "sources": "os.listdir('.') to list directory contents, os.stat(n).st_size to get file sizes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input from os.listdir('.') flows into the generator expression, which is used to produce output data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior observed. The code performs a standard directory listing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and os modules, defines a class Files that extends Lister, and implements take_action to return filenames and sizes. It uses os.listdir('.') to read directory contents and os.stat for file sizes. The implementation is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors. It appears to be a benign utility for listing files. No suspicious behavior, external data manipulation, or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, legitimate utility for listing files and their sizes in the current directory. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
