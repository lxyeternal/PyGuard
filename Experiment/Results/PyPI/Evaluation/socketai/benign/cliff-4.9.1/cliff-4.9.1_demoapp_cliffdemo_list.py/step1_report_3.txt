  "purpose": "Display a list of files in the current directory along with their sizes.",
  "sources": "os.listdir('.') reads the directory contents; os.stat(n) retrieves file size information.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly output untrusted data to external systems; it only prepares data for display.",
  "flows": "os.listdir('.') -> os.stat(n) for each filename -> data is prepared for output/display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Files that inherits from a CLI listing tool. It lists files in the current directory and retrieves their sizes using os.stat. The code uses standard Python libraries and appears to be a straightforward implementation for file listing. No external data is read, and no untrusted input is processed beyond listing directory contents. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign function of listing files and their sizes without any malicious intent or security risks detected.",
