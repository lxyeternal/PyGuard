  "purpose": "Display a list of files in the current directory with their sizes.",
  "sources": "os.listdir('.') to get filenames; os.stat(n).st_size to get file sizes.",
  "sinks": "Returning a tuple with file data; no untrusted data is used in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "os.listdir('.') as source feeding into the list comprehension; file sizes retrieved via os.stat.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a class from 'cliff.lister' to create a command-line interface. It defines a class Files that lists files in the current directory, providing filename and size. The take_action method uses os.listdir to get filenames and os.stat to get file sizes, returning these as output. No user input is processed directly, no external data is fetched, and no suspicious behavior is evident. The code's structure and logic are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to list directory contents with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as expected without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
