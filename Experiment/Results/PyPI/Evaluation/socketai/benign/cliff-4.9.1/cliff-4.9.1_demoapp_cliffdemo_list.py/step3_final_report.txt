  "purpose": "List files in the current directory with their sizes.",
  "sources": "os.listdir('.') to get filenames, os.stat(n).st_size to get file sizes.",
  "sinks": "Outputting filenames and sizes; no untrusted data sinks or leaks.",
  "flows": "From directory listing (os.listdir) to os.stat for size, then to output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward directory lister using standard modules. It reads directory contents and outputs filenames with sizes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is simple and benign. The security signals are consistent with a non-malicious utility. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign directory listing utility with no malicious intent or security flaws. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate. No modifications needed.",
