  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'cliffdemo' that configures package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long_description; imports from setuptools; reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or system modification code present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup procedures from setuptools to configure a Python package. It reads a README file for description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All code follows conventional patterns for Python package distribution. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling present. The code appears purely to facilitate package installation and setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or intentionally harmful.",
