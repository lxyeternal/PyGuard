The low security risk scores are justified. The confidence in report 4 should be slightly lowered to reflect the lack of actual code analysis. Overall, the evaluations are consistent and reasonable; no further adjustments are necessary."

The minimal concerns about lack of input validation are not security issues here, as os.stat() only reads metadata and does not execute code or access external resources."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0 across all reports. Minor variations, such as a 0.1 risk score, are unjustified and should be standardized to 0 for consistency."
