  "purpose": "Display details about a specified file, including size, UID, GID, and modification time.",
  "sources": "Input from command line argument 'filename'.",
  "sinks": "os.stat() function accesses the filesystem; no direct untrusted data sink.",
  "flows": "Command line argument -> get_parser -> take_action -> os.stat -> output data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries and methods without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility extending 'ShowOne' to display file metadata. It accepts an optional filename argument with a default of current directory. The os.stat() call retrieves file system information, which is then formatted for display. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code does not perform unsafe operations or contain suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign utility for inspecting file attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate utility for displaying file information without any malicious intent or security risks.",
