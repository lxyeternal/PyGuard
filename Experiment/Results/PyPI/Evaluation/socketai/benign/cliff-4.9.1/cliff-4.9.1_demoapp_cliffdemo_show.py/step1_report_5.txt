  "purpose": "To display details about a specified file, including its size, ownership, and modification time.",
  "sources": "User input from command line argument 'filename'.",
  "sinks": "os.stat() function accessing the filesystem; data returned is used for display purposes.",
  "flows": "Input from command line argument 'filename' → os.stat() call → data used to generate output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated elements detected. The code directly accesses filesystem metadata based on user input.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a CLI command class 'ShowOne' to display file information. It accepts a filename argument, defaulting to '.', and retrieves file statistics via os.stat(). The data is then formatted into columns for display. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code performs straightforward filesystem access based on user input without processing untrusted data in a vulnerable manner. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for displaying file metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads filesystem data based on user input and presents it.",
