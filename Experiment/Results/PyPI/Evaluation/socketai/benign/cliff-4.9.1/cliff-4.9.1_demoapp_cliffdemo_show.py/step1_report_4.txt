  "purpose": "Display details about a specified file, including size, ownership, and modification time.",
  "sources": "Input: 'filename' argument from command-line parser; data read from the filesystem via os.stat.",
  "sinks": "os.stat() system call to retrieve file metadata.",
  "flows": "User provides filename -> get_parser() parses input -> take_action() calls os.stat() on filename -> data is returned for display.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of default filename '.' is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that retrieves and displays file information. It uses standard library functions without any dynamic execution, external network calls, or suspicious behavior. The filename input is optional with a default, and data is retrieved securely from the filesystem. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for displaying file details. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
