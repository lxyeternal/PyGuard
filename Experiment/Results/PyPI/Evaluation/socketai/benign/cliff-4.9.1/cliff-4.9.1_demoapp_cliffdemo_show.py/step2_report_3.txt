  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a CLI utility extending 'ShowOne' to display file metadata.\n- It accepts an optional filename argument, defaulting to '.'.\n- It retrieves file info via `os.stat()` and displays size, UID, GID, and modification time.\n- Uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The logic is simple, safe, and standard for a file info utility.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Potential security concern:** The filename argument is used directly in `os.stat()` without validation or sanitization. However, since `os.stat()` only reads metadata and does not execute code, this does not constitute a security vulnerability in this context.\n- **Default argument:** Defaulting to '.' (current directory) is acceptable but could lead to unintentional large output if run without arguments. Not a security flaw but a usability consideration.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign very low scores (0 or 0.1). Given the code's simplicity, this is reasonable.\n- **Risk scores > 0.5:** None, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code only reads filesystem metadata based on user input, the risk is minimal.\n- The only concern might be if malicious input could cause issues, but `os.stat()` is safe against injection or code execution.\n- Therefore, risk scores should remain very low, close to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign utility for displaying file information.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n- The scores given in reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to lack of input validation, but not a real security issue)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate. The code is safe, simple, and intended for legitimate purposes. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
