  "purpose": "Display details about a specified file, including size, UID, GID, and modification time.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line argument 'filename' parsed in take_action.",
  "sinks": "os.stat() function accessing filesystem metadata; data returned for display.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> get_parser (parses filename) -> take_action (calls os.stat with filename) -> returns file info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI tool that retrieves and displays file metadata. It accepts a filename argument, defaulting to the current directory. The file name is used directly in os.stat() without validation or sanitization, but since os.stat() only retrieves metadata, this does not introduce code injection or security issues. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The implementation appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign function of displaying file metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided logic.",
