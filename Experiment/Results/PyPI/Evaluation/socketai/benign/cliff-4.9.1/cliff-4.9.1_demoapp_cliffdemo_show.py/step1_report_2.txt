  "purpose": "Display details about a specified file or current directory if no filename is provided.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line argument 'filename'.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.stat on the provided filename to retrieve file metadata.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument -> os.stat call -> data returned for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no unusual variable use, no suspicious file handling beyond standard os.stat.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a command-line utility that shows file metadata. It takes an optional filename argument, defaults to '.', and retrieves file stats via os.stat. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of os.stat is standard for file inspection. No obfuscation or suspicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a file info tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file information display utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard operations without suspicious behavior.",
