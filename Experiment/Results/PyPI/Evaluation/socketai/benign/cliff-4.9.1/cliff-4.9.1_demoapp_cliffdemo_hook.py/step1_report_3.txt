  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the use of commands and hooks within a CLI application, likely for extending functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it only defines command and hook classes with static and argument-based inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects. No untrusted data is sent over the network or written to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly involves class definitions, method calls, and simple print/write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The print statements and logging are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard logging and CLI command frameworks, defines classes for commands and hooks, and outputs simple text. It does not process untrusted input or perform any sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be a demonstration or template for extending CLI commands with hooks, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a demonstration of CLI command and hook usage, and contains no malicious or security risk indicators.",
