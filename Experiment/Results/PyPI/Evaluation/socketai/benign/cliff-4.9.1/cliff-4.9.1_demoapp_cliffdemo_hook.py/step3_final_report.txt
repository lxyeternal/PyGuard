{
  "purpose": "The code defines a CLI command class ('Hooked') with a simple 'take_action' method that outputs static text, and a hook class ('Hook') that adds an argument '--added-by-hook' and outputs messages before and after command execution. It serves as a demonstration of command and hook extension points.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed in 'get_parser', static strings in 'take_action', and hook methods 'before' and 'after' outputting static messages.",
  "sinks": "Standard output via 'stdout.write' in 'take_action', 'before', and 'after' methods.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (e.g., '--added-by-hook') are parsed but not used in a way that leads to untrusted data affecting sensitive operations; outputs are static or based on parsed args, with no data flowing into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'print' in 'get_parser' is benign; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; code is straightforward and intended as a demonstration template.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI extension with hooks, performing no untrusted data processing, network activity, or file operations. It outputs static messages and processes command-line arguments without security-sensitive side effects. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code's clarity and lack of external data handling indicate a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of CLI command and hook extension points, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
