  "purpose": "Define a command with hooks for extension points in a CLI application.",
  "sources": "Input sources are command-line arguments parsed by get_parser, and potentially app.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "app.stdout.write is used to output messages, but it does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from external sources to sinks. The hooks modify parser arguments and output static text.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard logging and CLI framework modules, defines a command and a hook for a CLI app. get_parser adds an argument '--added-by-hook' which is harmless. before and after methods output static strings. No data is read from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no suspicious network activity or file operations. The code appears to be a demonstration or extension mechanism, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of CLI command extension hooks, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
