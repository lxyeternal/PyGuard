  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and configure a Python application, possibly involving network communication and environment variable access.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, imported modules, possibly network sockets or file inputs",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, environment variables, file outputs",
  "flows": "Input from environment or user -> processed through functions -> potentially transmitted over network or written to system/files",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network addresses or commands. No unusual dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard initializations, imports common modules, accesses environment variables, and executes functions that appear benign. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoor access are evident. The structure and formatting are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a typical application setup with no suspicious behaviors.",
