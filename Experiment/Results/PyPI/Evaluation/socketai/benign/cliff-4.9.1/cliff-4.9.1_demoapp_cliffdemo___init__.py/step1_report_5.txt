  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or manipulation, but without seeing the actual code, the specific intent cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Possible sources include user input functions, environment variables, or external data files read via open/read functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are functions that send data over the network, write to files, execute system commands, or handle sensitive data like credentials.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission, file writing, or system commands, potentially passing through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual function calls (e.g., dynamic eval, exec) would be anomalies; however, specifics cannot be identified without the code.",
  "analysis": "Since the actual code is not provided, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Normally, this involves identifying source functions, sink functions, and their connecting data flows, as well as detecting suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious API calls.",
  "conclusion": "Without access to the code, a definitive conclusion cannot be made. However, no explicit malicious behavior or anomalies can be identified from the provided information. The risk appears low, but a review of actual code is necessary for certainty.",
