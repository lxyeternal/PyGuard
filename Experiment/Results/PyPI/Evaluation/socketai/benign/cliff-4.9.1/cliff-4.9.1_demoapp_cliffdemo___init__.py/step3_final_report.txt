  "sources": "Code input/output, environment variables, network connections, file operations, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data outputs, system calls.",
  "flows": "Sources (e.g., data input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system) via code logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; high confidence in benign behavior; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the lack of code, leading to low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence levels are generally appropriate, though report 4's high confidence (0.9) is slightly overstated given no code was analyzed. The reasoning is consistent, and the scores align with the evidence (or lack thereof). No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified. The assessments are cautious and reasonable, reflecting the limited information.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative given the absence of code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The low security risk scores are justified. The confidence in report 4 should be slightly lowered to reflect the lack of actual code analysis. Overall, the evaluations are consistent and reasonable; no further adjustments are necessary.",
