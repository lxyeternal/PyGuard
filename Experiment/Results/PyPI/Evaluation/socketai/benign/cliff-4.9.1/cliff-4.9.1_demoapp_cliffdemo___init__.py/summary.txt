  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative given the absence of code. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The low security risk scores are justified. The confidence in report 4 should be slightly lowered to reflect the lack of actual code analysis. Overall, the evaluations are consistent and reasonable; no further adjustments are necessary."
