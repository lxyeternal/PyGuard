  "purpose": "Define two CLI commands, one that prints a message and another that raises an error.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; no data input or untrusted data read from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Console output via self.app.stdout.write in the Simple command; exception raising in Error command.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; static log messages and console output, no data from external sources or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Logging is standard; no dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes inheriting from Command: 'Simple' prints a greeting message, and 'Error' intentionally raises an exception. Both use standard logging and write to stdout. No input reading, data processing, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain tampering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing simple command classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data sources, and no hidden backdoors.",
