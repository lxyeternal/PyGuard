{
  "purpose": "Defines two CLI commands, one for printing a message and one for raising an error.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command line are not explicitly read; no external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout; logging actions; no untrusted data sink is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; commands are straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes inheriting from a command framework. 'Simple' outputs a greeting message; 'Error' raises a runtime error. Both use standard logging and stdout for output. No external input handling, no dangerous code constructs, no obfuscated elements or suspicious data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, implementing simple command behaviors without any malicious intent or security risks.",
