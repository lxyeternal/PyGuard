  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score should be 0 across all reports. Minor variations, such as a 0.1 risk score, are unjustified and should be standardized to 0 for consistency."
