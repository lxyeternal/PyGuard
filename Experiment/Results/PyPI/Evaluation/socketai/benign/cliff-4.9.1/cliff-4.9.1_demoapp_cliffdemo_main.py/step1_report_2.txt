{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple CLI application using the 'cliff' framework with basic lifecycle hooks.",
  "sources": "Imports sys for command-line arguments; 'sys.argv' used in main() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "sys.argv is passed to app.run(), which manages command execution, but no unsafe data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a basic CLI app with lifecycle hooks for initialization, command preparation, and cleanup. Uses standard libraries and the 'cliff' framework. No data from untrusted sources appears to be mishandled. No external calls, network activity, or dangerous operations are present. The code appears clean, straightforward, and adheres to expected patterns for CLI apps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI app implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic lifecycle logging without unsafe operations.",
