{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket proxy that intercepts and logs messages sent and received over a WebSocket connection, with optional mimicking behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the websocket.recv() method; the URL parameter in websocket_proxy function; and the 'mimic' keyword argument.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data is sent via websocket.send(), especially when mimicking is active. Data is also stored in client_sent and client_received lists for logging.",
  "flows": "Input data from websocket.recv() is stored in client_received, and data to websocket.send() is stored in client_sent. When mimic is used, data flows from external input into send() and recv() wrappers, then into the WebSocket.",
  "anomalies": "The code involves wrapping websocket.send and websocket.recv to log data, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain usage, or obfuscation detected. The 'await websocket.send(\"\")' in the else branch is unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a WebSocket connection and creates a proxy object that tracks messages sent and received. It optionally mimics or intercepts message flow. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The wrapping of send/recv functions for logging is typical in debugging or testing tools. The 'await websocket.send(\"\")' line after mimic completes is somewhat unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are present. The code operates solely on the WebSocket stream without external suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a WebSocket message logger and proxy, intended for debugging or testing purposes. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. The overall security risk is minimal.",
