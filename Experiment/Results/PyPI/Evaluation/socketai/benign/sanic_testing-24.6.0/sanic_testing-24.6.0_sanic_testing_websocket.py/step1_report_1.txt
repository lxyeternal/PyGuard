{
  "purpose": "This code creates a WebSocket proxy that can intercept and log messages sent and received through a WebSocket connection, optionally mimicking behavior during testing or debugging.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'connect' function to establish WebSocket connection, and from the 'websocket.recv' method when receiving messages. It also accesses 'kwargs' for the 'mimic' parameter and the 'url' parameter for connection.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from the WebSocket connection can be appended to internal logs ('client_sent' and 'client_received') and potentially sent back via 'websocket.send'. There are no external data leaks or network exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the WebSocket ('websocket.recv') into 'client_received', and from 'client_sent' into 'websocket.send'. When 'mimic' is used, data from the client is intercepted and logged before being sent, and incoming messages are logged after reception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious anomalies detected. The code performs standard WebSocket message interception and logging. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a WebSocket connection and wraps its 'send' and 'recv' methods to log messages. The 'mimic' parameter allows for custom behavior during communication. No data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code's structure is consistent with typical proxy implementations and does not include obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard WebSocket proxy with message logging and optional mimic functionality. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The primary purpose is debugging or testing, with no evident security risks or malicious intent.",
