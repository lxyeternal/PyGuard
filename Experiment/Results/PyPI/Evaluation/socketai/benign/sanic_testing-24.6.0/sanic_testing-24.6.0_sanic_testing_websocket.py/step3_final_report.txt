{
  "purpose": "A WebSocket proxy that intercepts, logs, and optionally modifies messages for debugging or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from websocket.recv() and the mimic function if provided.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via websocket.send() and the optional 'await websocket.send(\"\")' line; logs are stored internally in client_sent and client_received lists.",
  "flows": "Data flows from websocket.recv() to internal logs and to the caller; data from the mimic function or external sources can be sent via websocket.send(); the 'await websocket.send(\"\")' line sends an empty message after mimic completes.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'await websocket.send(\"\")' after the mimic block is unusual but not malicious; reassigning send and recv methods is standard in proxies.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a WebSocket proxy that wraps the send and recv methods to log messages. It supports an optional mimic coroutine for custom behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The dynamic method reassignment is typical for such proxies. The 'await websocket.send(\"\")' line is unusual but benign, possibly intended to keep the connection alive or trigger behavior. The code is consistent with debugging/testing utilities, with no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), justified by the proxy's capabilities but no inherent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign WebSocket proxy used for message logging and testing. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
