{
  "purpose": "The code implements a WebSocket proxy that intercepts and logs messages sent and received through a WebSocket connection, with an optional mimic function to modify behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading the URL parameter for connection, intercepting websocket.send and websocket.recv methods, and optional mimic function input.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via websocket.send, which could potentially be manipulated or used maliciously if the data is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input URL and arguments -> connect to WebSocket -> possibly override send/recv -> mimic function executes -> messages are intercepted and logged -> messages sent/received flow through overridden methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of obscure language features or misleading variable names. The code relies on external libraries for WebSocket handling, which is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a WebSocket connection, wraps send and recv methods to log message data, and allows a mimic function to modify behavior. No malicious code or suspicious activity is present. The data logging appears benign, intended for debugging or testing. The optional mimic function could modify message flow, but without malicious intent indicated. No hardcoded secrets, no network exfiltration, no backdoors, and no obfuscated code are detected. The code does not handle sensitive information directly, nor does it contain any covert or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward WebSocket proxy for logging and optionally modifying message flow, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign debugging tool rather than malicious malware.",
