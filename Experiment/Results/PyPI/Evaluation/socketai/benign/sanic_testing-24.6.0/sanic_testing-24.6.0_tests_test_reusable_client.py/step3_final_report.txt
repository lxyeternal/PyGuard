{
  "purpose": "A simple Sanic web application with a single route returning static text 'foo', tested using pytest and sanic_testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the test client request to the '/' endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Response body is static; no untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Test client sends GET request to '/', response returns static 'foo' with status 200.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Sanic app with a test case verifying the response. No external data, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior is present. The test uses standard libraries and patterns. No suspicious signals, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The response is static, and the test simply verifies expected behavior. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
