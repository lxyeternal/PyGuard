  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no use of untrusted data or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only module import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a third-party library and sets package version information. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of defining what to export and package versioning. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign module defining an export and version info. No malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
