  "purpose": "This code appears to define module metadata and import a specific class for testing purposes within the 'sanic_testing.manager' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from sanic_testing.manager import TestManager'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class but does not process or handle any untrusted data; flow is limited to import and metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a package, sets a version string, and defines the module's public API. There are no input sources that could be exploited, no data sinks that could leak information, and no suspicious flows. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical module setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with an import statement, version declaration, and __all__ definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
