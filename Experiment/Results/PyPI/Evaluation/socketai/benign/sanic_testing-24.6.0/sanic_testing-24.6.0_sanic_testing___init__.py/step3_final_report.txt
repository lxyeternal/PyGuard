{
  "purpose": "This code imports a class 'TestManager' from the 'sanic_testing.manager' package, defines a version string, and specifies the exportable symbols via '__all__'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'sanic_testing.manager' is the primary source of data input, but it is a static import from a trusted package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static definitions.",
  "flows": "The code does not process any untrusted input; it only imports a class and sets module-level variables, so no data flow from source to sink exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import, defines a version string, and sets the '__all__' export list. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external data handling. The import is from a presumably trusted package, and the code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The minimal structure indicates a module setup or export file, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The only minor inconsistency is the security risk score in one report, which should be adjusted to zero for accuracy.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
