{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class named TestManager from the sanic_testing.manager module and defines module metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from sanic_testing.manager",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being processed or sent to external sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only performs import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing an import from a presumably trusted third-party library and defining metadata variables. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The presence of only import statements and a version string indicates standard module setup. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It imports a class and defines version info, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
