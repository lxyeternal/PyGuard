  "purpose": "A testing utility for Sanic applications that manages server lifecycle, executes HTTP and WebSocket requests, and captures request/response data.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as host, port, app state, middleware, and external libraries like httpx and websocket_proxy.",
  "sinks": "Network requests via httpx, WebSocket proxy, middleware modifications, server startup/shutdown, and response handling.",
  "flows": "Input data (requests) flow through middleware and request methods, leading to network calls or WebSocket proxy, then responses are processed and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'verify=False' in httpx client disables SSL verification, which is insecure but common in testing. Dynamic port assignment with 'randint' could cause conflicts but is not malicious. Import of 'websocket_proxy' from an unusual module path may seem suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Sanic test client with server lifecycle management, request execution, and WebSocket support. It uses insecure SSL verification ('verify=False') typical in testing environments, which poses security concerns if misused outside testing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The dynamic port assignment and middleware manipulations are standard testing patterns. The overall structure is clear, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility for Sanic applications with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the use of 'verify=False' in the HTTP client, which is acceptable in testing but should be avoided in production. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
