{
  "purpose": "This code defines and tests various asynchronous endpoints and websocket routes in a Sanic web application, including lifecycle event listeners.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the route requests and websocket connections via app.asgi_client.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs are response assertions and event setting; no untrusted data output or leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Requests flow from test functions to app endpoints; websocket connections also establish a flow but no malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of pytest-based asynchronous tests for a Sanic app. It verifies request handling, websocket connection, and server lifecycle event triggers. There are no indications of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or code injections. All operations are confined to testing app behavior with no external or secret data manipulation. The code structure is straightforward, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test suite for a Sanic application without any malicious intent or security risks. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are observed.",
