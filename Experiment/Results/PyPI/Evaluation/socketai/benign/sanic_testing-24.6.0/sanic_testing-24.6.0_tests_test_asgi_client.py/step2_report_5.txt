  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as test cases for an ASGI app, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows suggest malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The WebSocket handler just sets an event.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes benign code with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent reasoning and high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still consistent.\n- Mentions response assertions and WebSocket handling, with no untrusted data processing.\n- Notes minimal security risk (0.2), possibly due to the general nature of testing code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2 (justified, as testing code might be misused, but no actual malicious activity is present)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but similar reasoning.\n- Correctly notes the absence of malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- Security risk score (0.1) is low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Also aligns with the code, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- Confidence is 0.9, appropriate for the straightforward test code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) across reports, justified by the fact that this is test code, which generally poses minimal security risk but could be misused if taken out of context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and reasoning.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard testing code, unlikely to pose real security threat)\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided, confirming the benign nature of the code.",
