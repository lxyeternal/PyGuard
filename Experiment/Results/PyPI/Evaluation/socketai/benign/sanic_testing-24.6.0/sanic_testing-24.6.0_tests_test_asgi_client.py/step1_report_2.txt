{
  "purpose": "This code contains tests for an ASGI web application using the Sanic framework, verifying HTTP methods, WebSocket communication, and server lifecycle event listeners.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method calls on app.asgi_client (e.g., GET, POST, WebSocket), and event handler decorators.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that check response properties and event set status; no data sinks that lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke app.asgi_client methods which trigger server request handling and event setting, then assertions confirm behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard testing patterns, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard pytest and Sanic testing patterns for asynchronous route testing, WebSocket handling, and server event listeners. No input is taken from untrusted sources outside test parameters, and no data is sent or received that could cause malicious behavior. All code constructs are typical for testing web applications, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code's structure and usage indicate it's meant for legitimate testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of asynchronous tests for a Sanic app, with no indicators of malicious or maliciously tampered behavior. It performs typical testing procedures without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
