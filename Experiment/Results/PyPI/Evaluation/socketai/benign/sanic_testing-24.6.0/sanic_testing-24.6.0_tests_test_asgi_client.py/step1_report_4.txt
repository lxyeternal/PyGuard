{
  "purpose": "The code contains tests for a Sanic web application, including HTTP methods, WebSocket communication, and server lifecycle event listeners.",
  "sources": "The code reads test parameters, app.asgi_client method calls, and event handler functions.",
  "sinks": "The test assertions check response attributes and event flag status; no untrusted data output or insecure sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (HTTP methods, WebSocket requests, lifecycle triggers) lead to server responses and event flags, with no untrusted data influencing critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured as a set of asynchronous tests using pytest and Sanic framework. It tests basic HTTP methods, WebSocket connections, and server lifecycle hooks. All data flows are within controlled test environments. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The test functions merely validate server responses and event triggers, with no insecure or suspicious code behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard, well-structured test code for a Sanic application, with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
