  "purpose": "Define a test manager class for Sanic applications to facilitate testing with different clients.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Sanic application object passed to the constructor.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input (Sanic app) -> __init__ method -> self.test_client and self.asgi_client attributes are set up.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The assignment of the test manager to the app object is standard for some testing setups.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Sanic and testing classes, then defines a TestManager class with a constructor that initializes testing clients for the Sanic app. It assigns the clients to instance variables and attaches itself to the app object. The code appears to be a straightforward testing utility without any malicious behavior or obfuscation. No sensitive data handling, insecure code practices, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup utility for Sanic applications with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
