There is no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate, with a very low security risk score justified by the typical pattern of exposing internal attributes during testing."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing infrastructure with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to testing-specific practices like SSL verification bypass, which are acceptable in controlled environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the testing context."
