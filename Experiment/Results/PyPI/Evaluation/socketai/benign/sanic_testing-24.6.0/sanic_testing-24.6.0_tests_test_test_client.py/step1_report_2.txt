  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for a Sanic web application, testing HTTP methods, WebSocket routes, and server lifecycle event listeners.",
  "sources": "Imports (asyncio, pytest, sanic, websockets), test functions, app.route decorators, and test client invocations.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on response data, WebSocket message exchanges, and event listener executions.",
  "flows": "Test client sends HTTP requests or WebSocket messages; server handlers process these requests and respond; test assertions verify the behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. The code structure follows standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of typical unit tests for a Sanic web application, including WebSocket handling and server lifecycle events. It does not include any data input/output that could be used maliciously, nor does it perform any network communications outside of the test client-server interactions. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be for testing purposes only, with no malicious intent or suspicious anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of unit tests for a Sanic web application, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is intended for testing server and WebSocket functionalities and does not pose security threats.",
