  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script.\n- Reads version info from a local `__init__.py` via regex.\n- Reads README.md for long description.\n- Sets up package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No network calls, dynamic code execution, or external inputs beyond local files.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. Correctly identifies the script as a standard setup.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Comments:** Accurate and thorough. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; no malicious behavior or anomalies. Uses regex to extract version info, which is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Comments:** Correctly identifies the script as benign.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup operations, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Comments:** Accurate assessment.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with no malicious code, no obfuscation, no external data flows.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion; straightforward, local file reads, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Review & Justification**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, all reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No, all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Malware justification:** The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network calls, code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports avoid assumptions and focus on actual code behavior.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward package setup script, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. All dependencies and operations are standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nAll reports are accurate and align with the code's behavior. The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware or security risks. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
