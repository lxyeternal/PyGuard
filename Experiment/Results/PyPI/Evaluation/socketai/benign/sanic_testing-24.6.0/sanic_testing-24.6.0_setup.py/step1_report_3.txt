{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the sanic-testing Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ from __init__.py, reading README.md, and defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data; no sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from source files, loading long description, passing dependencies into setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading version info, reading README content, and configuring package dependencies. It uses regex to extract version number, which is typical. No untrusted data is used in dangerous ways. The dependencies and metadata are straightforward. No network connections, no code execution, no sensitive data handling or leaks. Overall, this appears to be a benign setup script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
