  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sanic-testing' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading '__version__' from 'sanic_testing/__init__.py' and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or dangerous functions.",
  "flows": "Input from files (version info and README) is processed and used to configure package setup; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard setup and file reading procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info and description from local files, then configures package metadata. No code execution or external calls that could be malicious. The code reads local files and sets up package metadata, which is standard behavior. No hardcoded secrets other than contact info (email), which is normal. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Requirements and test dependencies are specified normally. No malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads local files and configures package setup parameters without executing any untrusted code or performing unsafe operations.",
