{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sanic-testing' Python package, handling version extraction, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the __init__.py file for version info; reading README.md for long description; user inputs via package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows appear to reach untrusted external systems or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reading version from __init__.py -> used in setup; Reading README.md -> used in setup; No external data flows or untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse version string is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads local files (__init__.py and README.md) to gather package metadata. It then calls setup() with collected data and predefined dependencies. The code is straightforward, with no external inputs beyond local files. No network operations, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of codecs.open() with explicit encoding is standard. Overall, this is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads version info and package data, then invokes setup(). No malware or supply chain threats are evident.",
