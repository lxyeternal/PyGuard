  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'sanic-testing' Python package, responsible for configuring package metadata, reading version info, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'sanic_testing/__init__.py' using regex; reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads local files to extract version and description, then passes metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks with local file reads and regex parsing. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or external data flows are present. The regex used is typical for version extraction. Dependencies are standard. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate.",
