  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sanic-testing' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from '__init__.py' with regex; reading 'README.md' file; no external inputs or user data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no sensitive information or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from source file -> setting package metadata -> no data flows involving external inputs or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward, standard setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading the version from a source file using regex, reading a README file, and configuring setup parameters. No external user input, no network communication, and no malicious code are present. The only potential concern might be regex reading version info, but it is a typical practice and not suspicious. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python setup script with no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks identified. It functions solely to prepare package metadata and dependencies.",
