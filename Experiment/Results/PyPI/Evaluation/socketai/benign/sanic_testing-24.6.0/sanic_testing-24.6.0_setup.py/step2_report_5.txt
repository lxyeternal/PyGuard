  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The script reads version info from `__init__.py` via regex, reads README for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No external or untrusted data is used in sensitive operations.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation. The regex-based version extraction is standard practice.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a typical setup script. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the straightforward nature of reading version info and description, with no external inputs or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, regex is standard.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard setup pattern—reading version, description, dependencies, no malicious activity.  \n- **Findings:** No external data, no code execution, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid conclusion.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern—local file reads, no suspicious code, no external data.  \n- **Findings:** Standard setup logic, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports—local file reads, no external inputs, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Findings:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code, straightforward setup.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation in any report.  \n- **Security Risks:** No risky behaviors, external data flows, or secrets.  \n- **Scores Consistency:** All scores are 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a typical `setup.py`-like script, performing file reads and invoking `setup()`.  \n- No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- The regex used for version extraction is common and not suspicious.  \n- The dependencies are standard, and no external inputs are used in a risky manner.\n\n**Estimated scores after review:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final note:**  \nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
