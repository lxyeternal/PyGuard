{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup and build script for the PyObjC framework, handling SDK detection, environment configuration, testing, and packaging for macOS.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), environment variables, SDKSettings.plist files, filesystem reads, dynamic module imports, sys.path modifications.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls for system info, file read/write operations, sys.path and sys.modules modifications, logging, build and test orchestration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands and build flags; system info gathered via subprocess; configuration files read; sys.path altered for testing; build/test commands executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated code; subprocess calls are standard for environment detection; no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build and test setup activities for a Python extension on macOS. All subprocess calls are for gathering system info, and file operations are for configuration. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage signs are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and typical for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and test setup script for PyObjC, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low risk score is appropriate given its environment manipulation and system info gathering, which are standard in build processes.",
