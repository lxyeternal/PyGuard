{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform unit tests for SafariServices framework, specifically testing enum types and version constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SafariServices modules; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Assertions used to verify constants and enum types; these are safe and intended for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test assertions verify predefined constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and SafariServices module, then defines a test class with methods to verify enum types and constants at specified OS levels. All functions are standard for testing frameworks, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The code strictly performs version and enum value checks, which are safe and typical for unit tests.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test suite for SafariServices version constants and enum types. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are present. It is purely for validation purposes within a controlled testing environment.",
