{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for SafariServices, specifically testing enum types and constants related to SFSafariServicesVersion.",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SafariServices, usage of imported constants and functions within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs assertions on predefined constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward test suite with no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and the SafariServices module, then defines a test class that checks the enum type and specific constant values for SFSafariServicesVersion. It uses standard testing assertions and conditional decorators based on OS version. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation; the code appears purely for testing purposes with no external or untrusted data interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test code snippet that verifies enum types and constants related to SafariServices. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior.",
