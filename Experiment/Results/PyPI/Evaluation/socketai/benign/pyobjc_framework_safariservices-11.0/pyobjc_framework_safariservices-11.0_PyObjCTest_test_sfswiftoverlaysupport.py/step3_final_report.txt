{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test suite verifying enum types and version constants within the SafariServices framework, ensuring they match expected values at specific OS levels.",
  "sources": "The code reads static constants and enum definitions from the SafariServices module.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network operations, or external data sinks; the code only performs static assertions.",
  "flows": "The code checks predefined constants and enum types without dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static unit test verifying constants and enum types. It imports testing utilities, performs assertions on known constants, and uses OS version decorators appropriately. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data handling is involved. All reports confirm the benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and appropriate given the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for framework constants with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
