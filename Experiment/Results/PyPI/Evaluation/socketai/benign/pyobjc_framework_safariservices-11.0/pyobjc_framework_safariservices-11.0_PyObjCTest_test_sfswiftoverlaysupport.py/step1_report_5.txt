{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for SafariServices framework, specifically testing enum types and constants related to Safari versioning.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SafariServices modules; no external or untrusted input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The code primarily performs assertions to verify enum types and constants; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple test class that imports testing utilities and the SafariServices framework. It includes a method to verify the enum type and another to test the values of version constants, using assertions. The use of decorators indicates conditional testing based on OS version. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code's purpose is to validate framework constants and enum types in a safe and standard manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard test code for verifying constants and enum types in the SafariServices framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe and benign.",
