{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for SafariServices module, specifically testing enum types and constants related to SafariServices versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools and SafariServices modules, and the test methods that access constants and enum types within SafariServices.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines tests and performs static checks on constants and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The use of version constants is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing utilities and the SafariServices module, then defines a test class with methods that verify enum types and constants for SafariServices versioning. The tests check the presence and correctness of specific version constants with no external input processing, network activity, or sensitive data handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be standard unit test code for a specific SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying SDK constants and enum types. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It is a typical test script with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
