{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for SafariServices framework, specifically testing enum types and version constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SafariServices modules; usage of version constants",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; test assertions are static and do not process external input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected; straightforward test definitions",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and SafariServices module, then defines a test class with two test methods. The first verifies the enum type SFSafariServicesVersion, and the second checks version constants for specific OS levels. The tests are static, rely on predefined constants, and contain no dynamic code execution or data processing. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious behavior identified. Overall, this appears to be a benign testing script for a framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for SafariServices framework constants and enum types, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
