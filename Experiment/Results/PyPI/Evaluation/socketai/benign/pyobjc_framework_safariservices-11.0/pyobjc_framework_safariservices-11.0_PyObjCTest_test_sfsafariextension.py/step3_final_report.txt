  "purpose": "Unit test verifying the method signature of getBaseURIWithCompletionHandler_ in SafariServices.SFSafariExtension.",
  "sources": "The code imports TestSupport utilities and SafariServices; uses assertArgIsBlock to check method argument type.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data transmission or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "The test verifies the argument signature of a system API method; no data flow or execution beyond signature check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward API signature verification with version gating.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test that uses assertArgIsBlock to verify the callback argument signature of a SafariServices API method. It does not process data, transmit information, or perform any operations that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The test is standard for SDK validation, and the code's purpose is benign. The scores from reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign, signature verification nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard API signature test with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
