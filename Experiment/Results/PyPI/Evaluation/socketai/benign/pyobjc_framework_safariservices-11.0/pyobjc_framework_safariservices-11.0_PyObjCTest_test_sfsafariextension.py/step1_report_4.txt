  "purpose": "Unit testing for SafariServices SFSafariExtension methods on macOS 10.14.4+",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport and SafariServices modules; method call to getBaseURIWithCompletionHandler_",
  "sinks": "assertArgIsBlock method indicating handling of callback functions",
  "flows": "No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data flows; test assertions invoke native API methods with callbacks",
  "anomalies": "Use of min_os_level decorator to conditionally run code based on OS version; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and SafariServices, defines a test case class with a method that checks the behavior of a Safari extension method, specifically ensuring the completion handler is a block with the correct signature. It uses OS version gating to ensure compatibility. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code appears standard for unit testing of an API.\n\nNo suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns identified. The code strictly performs a test of a system API's callback argument handling, which is normal in SDK testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test case for SafariServices API, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply verifies correct API usage within a controlled test environment.",
