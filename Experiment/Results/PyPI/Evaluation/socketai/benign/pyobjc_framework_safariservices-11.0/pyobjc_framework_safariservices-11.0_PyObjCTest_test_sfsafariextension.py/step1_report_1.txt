  "purpose": "Unit test for SafariServices.SFSafariExtension method getBaseURIWithCompletionHandler_ using min_os_level decorator.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase, min_os_level, and SafariServices; use of getBaseURIWithCompletionHandler_ method.",
  "sinks": "Method call to getBaseURIWithCompletionHandler_ with a callback argument.",
  "flows": "The test sets an argument as a callback block to getBaseURIWithCompletionHandler_ which may be invoked asynchronously.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertArgIsBlock to specify callback signature; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the SafariServices framework. It defines a test class with a method that applies a minimum OS version condition. Inside the test, it configures the SafariExtension's method to expect a callback block with a specific signature, which is standard for async Cocoa API testing. There are no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded secrets, and no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test setup for an Apple framework method.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign unit test for a Safari extension API method, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code uses typical testing patterns without any anomalies or harmful intent.",
