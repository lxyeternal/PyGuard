  "analysis": "The code is a simple comment string with no executable content, data flows, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the absence of code, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the content. No anomalies or issues are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a comment. All reports are accurate, and the security risk is nonexistent. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
