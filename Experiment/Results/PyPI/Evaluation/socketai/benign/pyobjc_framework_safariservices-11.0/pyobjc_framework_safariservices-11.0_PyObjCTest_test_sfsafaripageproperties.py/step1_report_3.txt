{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for the SafariServices framework, specifically testing properties of SFSafariPageProperties.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SafariServices modules, used for testing and interfacing with SafariServices.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only performs assertions on framework properties.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only checks framework-defined properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the SafariServices framework, then defines a test case class that checks the boolean nature of specific properties of SFSafariPageProperties. The @min_os_level decorator ensures tests run only on OS versions 10.12 or above. The assertions verify that 'usesPrivateBrowsing' and 'isActive' are boolean values. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data leaks. The code is standard for a unit test suite focused on framework property validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test script for the SafariServices framework with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
