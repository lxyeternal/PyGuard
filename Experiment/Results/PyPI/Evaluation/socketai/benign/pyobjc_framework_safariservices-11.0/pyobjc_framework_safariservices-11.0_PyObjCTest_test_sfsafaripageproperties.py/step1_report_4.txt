{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the SafariServices framework, specifically testing properties of SFSafariPageProperties.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SafariServices modules, including test decorators and class properties.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external communications are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely performs static assertions on property types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the SafariServices framework, then defines a test class with a method that verifies two boolean properties of SFSafariPageProperties. The test uses a decorator to specify OS version constraints. The assertions check that certain properties are boolean results. The code functions as a static test case for property types without executing any external or system-altering actions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, harmless test code for verifying property types within the SafariServices framework. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
