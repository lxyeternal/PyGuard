  "purpose": "Verify that specific properties of SFSafariPageProperties return boolean values as expected in a unit test.",
  "sources": "Import statements, property accessors in the test method",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external data or network operations",
  "flows": "Test method calls property getters and asserts their boolean result",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward property type assertions, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test verifying property return types; it imports testing utilities, applies a version check decorator, and asserts that two properties return boolean values. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is clear and standard. No anomalies or risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test verifying property types in the SafariServices framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
