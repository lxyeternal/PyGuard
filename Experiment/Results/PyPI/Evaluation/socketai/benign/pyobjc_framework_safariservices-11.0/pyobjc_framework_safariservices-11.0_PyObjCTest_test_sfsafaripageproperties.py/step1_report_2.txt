  "purpose": "Unit tests for SafariServices.SFSafariPageProperties properties using the TestSupport framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport and SafariServices modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from source to sink in the test code.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, primarily testing boolean result types; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and the SafariServices framework, then defines a test case class with a method that asserts certain properties of SFSafariPageProperties return boolean results. The test is conditioned on a minimum OS level. No dynamic execution, data manipulation, or network activity is present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign unit test suite for SafariServices API properties, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
