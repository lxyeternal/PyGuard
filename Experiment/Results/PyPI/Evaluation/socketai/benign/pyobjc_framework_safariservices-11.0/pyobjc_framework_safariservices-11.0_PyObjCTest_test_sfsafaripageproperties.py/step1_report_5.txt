{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test for SafariServices framework's SFSafariPageProperties class, specifically testing method return types.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase, min_os_level, and SafariServices; usage of SafariServices.SFSafariPageProperties.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks; it only verifies method return types.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink involving untrusted input; the test confirms method properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present; the code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and SafariServices module, then defines a test class with methods checking the return types of properties 'usesPrivateBrowsing' and 'isActive'. The '@min_os_level' decorator indicates platform version check. The code performs standard unit testing without any dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign unit test for verifying property types in SafariServices; there is no malicious behavior or security risk.",
