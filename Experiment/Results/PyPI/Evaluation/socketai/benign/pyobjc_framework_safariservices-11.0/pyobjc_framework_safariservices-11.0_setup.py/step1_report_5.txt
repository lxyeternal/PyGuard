{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure Python bindings for the SafariServices framework on macOS using pyobjc.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script file (__file__), directory listing of 'Modules', importing os, sys, and pyobjc_setup, and reading package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands. Setup configuration does not execute code with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows that involve untrusted data. The code primarily prepares installation parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated segments, or suspicious dynamic behaviors. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, modifies sys.path, defines package version, and calls setup() with configuration details for the pyobjc framework. It reads module filenames for dependencies and sets extra link arguments. All operations are typical for a setup script for a Python package that wraps a system framework. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script for wrapping the SafariServices framework. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and typical for such package configuration.",
