{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and installing a Python wrapper for the macOS SafariServices framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reading the file system for modules ('os.listdir'), reading the script's directory ('os.path.dirname(__file__)'), and the script's own docstring (__doc__).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or used in commands.",
  "flows": "The script gathers module dependencies from the filesystem and uses them to configure the package build process. No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code is a standard setup script with typical usage of setuptools and pyobjc.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, importing necessary modules, setting up package metadata, and defining build extensions. It reads the module files from the local filesystem, but this is a standard practice. No signs of malicious intent such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The script does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted input, or modify system files outside the scope of package installation. The code's purpose aligns with normal packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for a Python wrapper around macOS's SafariServices framework. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
