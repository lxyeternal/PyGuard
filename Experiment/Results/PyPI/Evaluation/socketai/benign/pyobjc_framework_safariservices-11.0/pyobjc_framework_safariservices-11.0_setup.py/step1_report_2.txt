{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for building and installing the 'pyobjc-framework-SafariServices' package, providing wrappers for the SafariServices framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), sys.path.insert(0, ...), __doc__",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code primarily involves package setup and imports without executing untrusted input or performing network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly handles package configuration and file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code performs standard setup tasks for a Python extension package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and modifies sys.path to include the current directory, then imports setup functions from pyobjc_setup. It defines package metadata, including name, description, OS requirements, package list, extension modules, dependencies, and versioning. The extension module depends on Objective-C source files in the Modules directory and links against the SafariServices framework. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script, with no evidence of malicious activity, hidden behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script for a Python wrapper around the SafariServices framework. It does not contain any malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.",
