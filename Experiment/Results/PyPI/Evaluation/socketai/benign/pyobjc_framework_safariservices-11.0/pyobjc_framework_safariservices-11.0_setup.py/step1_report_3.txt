{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package that provides wrappers for the SafariServices framework on macOS, intended for installation and distribution via package managers like pip.",
  "sources": "os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), and the import statements (pyobjc_setup, sys).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage are present. The code mainly sets up a build extension and does not handle user input or external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply reads module files and configures build parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path for module access, defines package metadata, and sets up an extension module for building the wrapper using pyobjc. It dynamically lists files in the 'Modules' directory to determine dependencies and specifies linker arguments to include the SafariServices framework. There are no inputs from external sources that could be malicious, and no data processing or transmission is performed. The code follows typical patterns for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python framework wrapper, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply configures build parameters and dependencies without processing untrusted data.",
