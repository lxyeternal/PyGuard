{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and installing the pyobjc-framework-SafariServices package, which provides Python wrappers for the SafariServices framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Reads from __file__ (file path), os.listdir('Modules'), and environment variables via sys.path manipulation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks or external networks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; primarily static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code performs standard setup procedures using established Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies sys.path, imports setup functions, and configures a package build for a macOS framework wrapper. It dynamically depends on files in the 'Modules' directory and constructs extension modules accordingly. No network activity, data leakage, or suspicious code behavior is present. The code is typical for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging a macOS framework wrapper. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
