  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code behavior, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for packaging a Python wrapper around the macOS SafariServices framework.\n- The code only performs filesystem operations, imports, and package configuration.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or code execution based on external input is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are detected.\n- The purpose is clearly for packaging and distribution, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Valid; it's a setup script for the SafariServices wrapper.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or dangerous sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code is benign, standard package setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low, justified by the nature of setup scripts).\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the code is typical for a setup script.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately describes the code as standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No issues.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the script is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately describes the code as standard setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), justified because setup scripts are inherently low risk, serving only configuration purposes.\n\n**Overall, the assessments are accurate and consistent.** No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** 0.05–0.1 (minimal, as it's a setup script with no external data or network activity)\n\n**Final note:** The scores reflect the benign nature of the code, which is purely for packaging a system framework wrapper.",
