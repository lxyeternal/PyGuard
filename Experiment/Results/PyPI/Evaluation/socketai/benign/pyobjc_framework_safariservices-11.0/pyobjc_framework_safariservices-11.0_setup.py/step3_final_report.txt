  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python wrapper around the macOS SafariServices framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reading of module files from 'Modules' directory, os.path.dirname(__file__), and __doc__ for description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or external command execution present.",
  "flows": "Reading module filenames and configuring extension modules; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, dynamically includes module files, and configures build parameters. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute code based on external data. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is solely to facilitate package installation, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration for packaging a macOS framework wrapper. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are accurate and justified.",
