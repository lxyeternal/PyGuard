  "purpose": "Unit test for SafariServices.SFSafariExtensionManager's method getStateOfSafariExtensionWithIdentifier_completionHandler_",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SafariServices; test method invocation",
  "sinks": "assertArgIsBlock call which checks argument type of a method",
  "flows": "Method getStateOfSafariExtensionWithIdentifier_completionHandler_ with a block argument passed to assertArgIsBlock",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed; code appears to be a straightforward test setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and the SafariServices framework, then defines a test case that verifies the signature of a specific method using PyObjCTools. The focus is on testing method signature correctness, not on executing or exploiting functionality. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is typical of a unit test for verifying method signatures in macOS/iOS Objective-C bindings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test verifying method signatures in SafariServices. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious activities present.",
