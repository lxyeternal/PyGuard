  "purpose": "Verify that the method getStateOfSafariExtensionWithIdentifier_completionHandler_ has the correct callback signature using a unit test.",
  "sources": "The method getStateOfSafariExtensionWithIdentifier_completionHandler_ and its argument, verified via assertArgIsBlock.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The test checks the method's argument signature; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward signature verification test.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and SafariServices, defines a test class with a method decorated for macOS 10.12+, and uses assertArgIsBlock to verify the callback argument's signature. It does not handle external data, perform network activity, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The purpose is solely to verify API correctness. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious activity or security risks. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1 to 0.9) is justified given the nature of the code, but a score of 0 is appropriate since no security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying method signatures within SafariServices. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and all reports' assessments are accurate. Final scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.",
