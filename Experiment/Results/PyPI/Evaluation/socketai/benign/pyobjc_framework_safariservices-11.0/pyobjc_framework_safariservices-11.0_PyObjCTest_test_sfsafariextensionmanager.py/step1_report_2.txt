  "purpose": "Unit test for SafariServices.SFSafariExtensionManager methods with minimal OS level requirement",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools and SafariServices; method call to getStateOfSafariExtensionWithIdentifier_completionHandler_",
  "sinks": "Method call that involves a callback/block, but no untrusted data processing or output occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; test asserts block argument type",
  "anomalies": "Use of @min_os_level decorator to conditionally run tests; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that verifies method signature and callback block type for Safari extension manager API on macOS 10.12 or later. It does not read external input, write data, or perform network operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The focus is on validating method signatures and OS level requirements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test with no malicious intent or security risks. It checks the method signature and callback type for a macOS API without any suspicious or harmful code.",
