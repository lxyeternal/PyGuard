{
  "purpose": "Define a test helper class and a test case for Safari extension handling, focusing on protocol existence and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools and SafariServices, class method definitions, assertions on protocols and method arguments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code mainly defines structure and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary testing and Safari framework modules, defines a helper class with placeholder methods that are expected to be implemented, and a test case class that verifies the existence of protocols and correct method argument types. The assertions check for protocol presence and block argument signatures, which are typical in test scenarios. No data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior is observable. No obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies that suggest sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup for Safari extension protocols and methods, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and serves its purpose for unit testing.",
