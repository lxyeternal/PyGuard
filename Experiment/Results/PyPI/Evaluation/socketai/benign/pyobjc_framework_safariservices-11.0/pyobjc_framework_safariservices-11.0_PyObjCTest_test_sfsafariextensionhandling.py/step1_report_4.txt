{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for Safari extension handling, specifically defining a helper class and testing protocol and method existence with certain argument types.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it imports modules and defines classes/methods for testing purposes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow paths leading to data leaks, system modification, or external communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the code solely defines test stubs and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs detected. The code uses standard testing patterns and library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and SafariServices modules, defines a helper class with placeholder methods, and a test class that verifies protocol existence and method argument types. No data input, external communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. All methods are placeholders with no logic that could be malicious. The use of 'assertArgIsBlock' checks for method signatures in testing context, not executing malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for Safari extension interfaces, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
