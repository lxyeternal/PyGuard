{
  "purpose": "The code defines a helper class with placeholder methods for Safari extension handling and a test class that verifies protocol existence and method signatures, serving as a unit test scaffold for Safari extension API conformance.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and defines methods, but does not process data or user input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code contains no external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only verifies protocol and method signatures without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present; the code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign unit test setup verifying the existence of protocols and method signatures for Safari extension handling. It contains no malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The methods are placeholders, and the test assertions are standard. No external data or network interactions are involved. The code's purpose is solely for API conformance testing, with no security risks or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test scaffold with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
