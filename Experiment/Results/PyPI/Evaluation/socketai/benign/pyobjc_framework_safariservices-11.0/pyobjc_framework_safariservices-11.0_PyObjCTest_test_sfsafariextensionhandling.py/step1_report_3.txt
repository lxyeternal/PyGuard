  "purpose": "Define a helper class and test case for Safari extension handling, including protocol existence checks and method signature validations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport and SafariServices modules, class method definitions, and assertions within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; the code primarily sets up tests and method signatures without processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code sets up method signatures and test assertions without data flow between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code appears to be standard test setup code with no unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to testing and Safari services, defines a helper class with placeholder methods, and a test class with version-specific checks for protocol existence and method argument validation. All methods are stubs with no implementation that could be malicious. The assertions verify method signatures and protocol presence, typical for unit tests. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The code appears benign and focused on testing Safari extension handling capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing setup for Safari extension handling, verifying protocol existence and method signatures. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
