{
  "purpose": "The code defines a helper class for handling Safari extension events and a test case for the Safari extension handling protocol.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools and SafariServices; class method definitions; assertions on protocol and method existence",
  "sinks": "Assertions on protocol and method existence; no data flows or untrusted inputs are processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code primarily sets up tests and protocol checks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; use of test framework assertions and protocol checks is standard for testing; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a helper class with placeholder methods, and a test class that verifies the existence of a protocol and certain method signatures with block arguments. The use of min_os_level decorators indicates compatibility checks. All methods and assertions are standard for testing Safari extension protocols and methods, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalous code activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign unit test setup for Safari extension handling protocols and methods. There are no suspicious behaviors, no data leaks, no malicious intent, and no obfuscated code. It solely verifies the presence of specific protocols and method signatures, typical in testing environments.",
