  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a helper class with placeholder methods and a test case verifying protocol existence and method signatures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard testing code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign unit test setup, verifying protocol presence and method signatures. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard testing practices with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates that the code is a straightforward test setup with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on the absence of data flows or external interactions, confirming benign test scaffolding.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms the code is standard test scaffolding, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code matches the description—it's a test suite for Safari extension protocols, with no actual implementation logic beyond method signatures.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** No data leaks, external communication, or security-sensitive operations.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** All reports agree on zero risk, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nThis analysis confirms the reports are accurate and consistent with the benign intent of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign unit test setup for Safari extension protocols. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
