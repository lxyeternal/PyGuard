{
  "purpose": "The code defines a helper class and a test class for Safari extension handling, specifically for testing protocol existence and method signatures related to Safari extension functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools and SafariServices, method definitions within classes, assertions on method arguments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code is primarily defining test scaffolding and protocol assertions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard test code for macOS Safari extension support.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing tools and SafariServices, then defines a helper class with methods that are placeholders (no actual implementation). The test class checks for protocol existence and validates method argument types, specifically that certain methods accept blocks with specified signatures. The use of min_os_level ensures compatibility checks for macOS 10.12 or later. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. All code appears consistent with standard testing practices for macOS Safari extension development.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test setup for Safari extension protocols and methods, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is normal test scaffolding code meant for validation of API conformance.",
