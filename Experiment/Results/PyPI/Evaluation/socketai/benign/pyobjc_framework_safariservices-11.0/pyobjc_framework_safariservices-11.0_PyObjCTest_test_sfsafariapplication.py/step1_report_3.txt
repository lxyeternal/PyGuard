  "purpose": "Unit tests for SafariServices framework functions related to Safari app extensions and message handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestSupport and SafariServices modules; methods calling SafariServices functions with specific arguments.",
  "sinks": "Assertions calling functions that register callbacks (blocks) with SafariServices methods.",
  "flows": "Method calls to SafariServices functions with callback parameters; no untrusted data inputs or external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns. The code strictly tests SDK functions and their argument types.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class for SafariServices, specifically testing methods related to Safari extension applications, with OS-level constraints. It sets up assertions to verify argument types (blocks) for specific functions, with no data processing, user input handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The focus is on method signature verification for framework functions. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit testing script for SafariServices SDK functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. The code's purpose is to validate correct method signatures and OS level constraints.",
