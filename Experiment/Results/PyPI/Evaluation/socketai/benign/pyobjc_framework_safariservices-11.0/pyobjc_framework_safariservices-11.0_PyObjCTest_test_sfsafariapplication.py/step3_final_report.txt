{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying method signatures, argument types, and constants within the SafariServices framework, primarily for API validation and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Method calls to SafariServices.SFSafariApplication functions, constants such as SFExtensionMessageKey and SFExtensionProfileKey.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network communication, or data leaks are present; the code only performs assertions on method signatures and constants.",
  "flows": "The code does not process data flows; it verifies method signatures and constants without data input or output flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for API testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite verifying API signatures and constants in SafariServices, with no data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior. All assertions are standard for API validation, OS version checks are appropriate, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard API validation test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and align with the code's benign nature.",
