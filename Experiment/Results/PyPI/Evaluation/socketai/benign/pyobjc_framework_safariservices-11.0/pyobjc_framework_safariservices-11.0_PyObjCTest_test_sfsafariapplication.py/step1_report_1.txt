  "purpose": "Unit tests for SafariServices framework functions related to Safari app extension management, ensuring correct argument types and constants.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: PyObjCTools.TestSupport, SafariServices.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flow, network communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code contains test assertions without data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying method argument types and constants in the SafariServices framework. It uses decorators for OS version checks and asserts for argument types, which are typical in test scenarios. No input reading, data processing, or external communication is present. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for SafariServices API with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
