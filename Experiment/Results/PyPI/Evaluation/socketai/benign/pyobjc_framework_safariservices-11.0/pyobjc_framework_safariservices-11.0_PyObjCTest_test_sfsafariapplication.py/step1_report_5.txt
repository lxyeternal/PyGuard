  "purpose": "Unit testing for SafariServices framework functions related to Safari application interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from PyObjCTools and SafariServices; method calls within testMethods and other test functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that validate callback blocks and constants; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily performs assertions and type checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The use of 'assertArgIsBlock' is standard for testing callback signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities and SafariServices modules, then defines test cases that verify the correct setup of callback blocks for Safari application methods at various OS versions. All methods are well-structured, utilizing appropriate assertions to ensure callback signatures. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code serves solely as a test suite for verifying method signatures and constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for SafariServices framework with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code segments. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
