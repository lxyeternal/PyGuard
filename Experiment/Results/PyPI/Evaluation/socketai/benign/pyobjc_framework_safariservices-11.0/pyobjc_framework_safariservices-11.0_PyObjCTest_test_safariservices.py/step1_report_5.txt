  "purpose": "Unit test for callable metadata sanity check in SafariServices module",
  "sources": "Import statements for PyObjCTools.TestSupport and SafariServices",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform critical actions",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code performs a simple test invocation without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing support and SafariServices modules, then defines a test case that calls a method to verify callable metadata. This is a straightforward unit test with no input/output handling, external data processing, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for module metadata validation with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
