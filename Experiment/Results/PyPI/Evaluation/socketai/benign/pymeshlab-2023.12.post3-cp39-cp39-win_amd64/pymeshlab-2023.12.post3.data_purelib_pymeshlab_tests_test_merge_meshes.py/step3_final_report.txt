{
  "purpose": "Load two 3D mesh files ('bone.ply' and 'airplane.obj'), merge them, and save the resulting mesh.",
  "sources": "Files 'bone.ply' and 'airplane.obj' loaded via ms.load_new_mesh() using paths from samples_common.",
  "sinks": "ms.save_current_mesh() writes the merged mesh to disk; no untrusted data sinks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Input files loaded into MeshSet, merged with generate_by_merging_visible_meshes(), then saved to output path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward use of standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard mesh loading, merging, and saving operations with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It relies on external modules for path management, which appears benign. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score of 0.1 are consistent with the benign, routine nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe 3D mesh processing script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and justified based on static analysis.",
