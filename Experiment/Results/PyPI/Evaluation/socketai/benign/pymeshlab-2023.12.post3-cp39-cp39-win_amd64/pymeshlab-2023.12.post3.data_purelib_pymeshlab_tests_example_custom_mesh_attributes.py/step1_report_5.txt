{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates creating and manipulating custom mesh attributes using the pymeshlab library, including reading a mesh, computing new attributes, and saving the mesh.",
  "sources": "Reads a mesh file ('cube.obj') from a path determined by samples_common.samples_absolute_path().",
  "sinks": "Saves a mesh file ('cube_custom_attr.ply') with custom attributes, and prints numpy arrays containing attribute data.",
  "flows": "Loads mesh from file -> computes and adds custom attributes -> saves mesh with attributes -> creates and adds numpy array as custom attribute -> retrieves and prints attribute data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. Uses relative import and external library functions normally associated with mesh processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard operations with pymeshlab to manipulate mesh attributes. It imports data from a local sample path, processes mesh attributes, and saves outputs in common formats. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The usage of numpy arrays and attribute management appears legitimate and intended for mesh processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate mesh processing functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware or security risks within this code segment.",
