{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load a 3D mesh, compute and save custom scalar and point attributes, and modify the mesh by adding custom vertex attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads mesh data from 'cube.obj' file and reads from and writes to output directory; accesses vertex and face attribute arrays.",
  "sinks": "Saves modified mesh to a ply file, prints numpy arrays; no data leakage or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Mesh loaded -> computes attributes -> stores attributes in numpy arrays -> saves mesh -> adds custom vertex attribute from numpy array -> retrieves and prints attribute",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Use of relative imports and numpy is standard; no obfuscated code or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical mesh processing tasks using the pymeshlab library and numpy for data handling. It loads a mesh, computes custom attributes, and saves results. The code only interacts with local files and does not establish network connections or handle untrusted input beyond reading from a known file. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or hidden behavior. The code structure and function calls are standard for mesh processing workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate mesh processing script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It only performs data manipulation and storage operations without any signs of malware or security risks.",
