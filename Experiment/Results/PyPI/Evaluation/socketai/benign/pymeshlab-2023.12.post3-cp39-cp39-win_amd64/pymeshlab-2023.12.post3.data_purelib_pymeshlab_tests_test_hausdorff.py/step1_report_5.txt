{
  "purpose": "The code loads 3D mesh files and performs Hausdorff distance calculations between meshes, likely for comparison or analysis of 3D models.",
  "sources": "Reads mesh files from a path specified by samples_common.samples_absolute_path() and loads them into the MeshSet object.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted input data or output sensitive data; the code mainly performs computations and prints results.",
  "flows": "Mesh files are loaded from the filesystem (source), and the results are printed (sink). No untrusted data flows into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. Use of local file paths and standard library functions appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library (pymeshlab) for mesh processing, loads specific mesh files from a path returned by a common utility, and performs a geometric comparison. There are no indications of malicious intent, code injection, or data exfiltration. The operations involve standard file loading, mesh processing, and printing results, all of which are typical for such scripts. The code does not contain any suspicious network activity, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward mesh comparison utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations within its scope and does not exhibit any anomalies or malicious indicators.",
