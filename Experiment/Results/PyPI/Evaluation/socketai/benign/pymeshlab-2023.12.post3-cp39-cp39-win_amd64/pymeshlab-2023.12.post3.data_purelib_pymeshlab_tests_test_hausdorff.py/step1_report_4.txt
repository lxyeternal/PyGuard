{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to load 3D mesh files and perform Hausdorff distance analysis between them using the pymeshlab library.",
  "sources": "Reads sample mesh files ('cow.obj', 'bone.ply') from a specified path via samples_common.samples_absolute_path().",
  "sinks": "Uses the pymeshlab library functions to process meshes and compute distances; no direct data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Loads mesh files -> applies remeshing -> calculates Hausdorff distance -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears straightforward and intended for analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script loads mesh files from a known sample directory, performs remeshing, and computes Hausdorff distances between meshes. All operations use the pymeshlab library, which is standard for mesh processing. No suspicious input handling, no data exfiltration, no network communication, and no hidden behaviors are evident. The code strictly pertains to 3D mesh analysis and does not include malicious or maliciously-inclined functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate mesh processing tasks without any malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It relies on external sample files and a standard library, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
