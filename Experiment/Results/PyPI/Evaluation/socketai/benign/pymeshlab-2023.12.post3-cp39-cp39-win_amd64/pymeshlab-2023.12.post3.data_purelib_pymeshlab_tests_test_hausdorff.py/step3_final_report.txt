{
  "purpose": "The code loads specific mesh files, performs remeshing, and calculates Hausdorff distances for mesh analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads local files ('cow.obj', 'bone.ply') via samples_common.samples_absolute_path().",
  "sinks": "Outputs to console via print statements; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Reads mesh files -> processes meshes (remeshing, distance calculation) -> outputs results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward mesh analysis script utilizing standard library functions. It operates solely on local files with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. All operations are typical for 3D mesh processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, performing standard mesh processing without malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to hardcoded file paths which are typical in test scripts.",
  "confidence": 1,
