{
  "purpose": "The code modifies filter names within Python or Jupyter Notebook files by replacing specified strings based on a key-value mapping loaded from a file.",
  "sources": "Reads from the script input path, the 'keys.txt' file for key-value pairs, and the content of Python or Notebook files for modification.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified content back to the original files; no external data transfer or output to network observed.",
  "flows": "Loads key-value pairs from 'keys.txt' -> Reads script or directory files -> Replaces specified strings -> Writes back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. The replace_all function performs straightforward string replacements without executing or evaluating data. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file reading and string replacement operations based on key-value pairs loaded from an external text file. It handles both individual files and directories, updating files in place. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate automation of filter name updates, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing straightforward file content modifications based on external configuration. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical utility script for batch text replacement.",
