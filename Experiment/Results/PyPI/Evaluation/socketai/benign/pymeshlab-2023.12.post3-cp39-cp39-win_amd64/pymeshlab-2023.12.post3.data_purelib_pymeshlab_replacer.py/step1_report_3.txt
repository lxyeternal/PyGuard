{
  "purpose": "The code modifies Python or Jupyter Notebook scripts by replacing filter names based on a key-value mapping loaded from a file.",
  "sources": "Reads the input script file(s) specified by a path, loads the 'keys.txt' file for replacement pairs, reads the script content.",
  "sinks": "Writes the modified script back to the original file(s).",
  "flows": "Loads 'keys.txt' -> Reads input script(s) -> Performs string replacements -> Writes back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed. Uses straightforward file I/O and string manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a configuration file 'keys.txt' to create a dictionary of replacements, then applies these replacements to a script or scripts. It performs file system operations like checking if the input is a file or directory, reading text content, and writing back. There is no indication of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The operations are standard for batch text processing and script modification.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for updating filter names in scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
