{
  "purpose": "The code replaces filter names in Python scripts or notebooks based on a mapping defined in 'keys.txt'. It processes files either individually or in a directory, modifying the content and saving the changes.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'keys.txt' file to load replacement mappings; reading the content of input script or notebook files using Path(f).read_text().",
  "sinks": "Writing modified content back to the same files with open(f, 'w') as myfile, potentially overwriting original code.",
  "flows": "Load replacement keys from 'keys.txt' -> Read file content -> Perform string replacements -> Overwrite original files with updated content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The script performs straightforward text processing without external network access, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script loads key-value pairs from 'keys.txt' to replace specific filter names in provided Python or notebook files. It reads files either directly or from a directory, applies replacements, and rewrites the files. The operations are limited to file I/O and string replacement, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or data theft. The functions used are standard and do not include obfuscated or malicious constructs. There are no hidden backdoors or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for updating filter names in code files, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs text replacements based on a provided mapping. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
