{
  "purpose": "This script loads string replacement mappings from 'keys.txt' and applies them to specified script files or notebooks, overwriting the original files with updated content.",
  "sources": "Reads 'keys.txt' for replacement pairs; reads input script or directory of scripts for modification.",
  "sinks": "Overwrites original files with modified content; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Loads replacement pairs from 'keys.txt' -> applies replacements to script files -> writes back to same files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior; external 'keys.txt' could be manipulated to introduce malicious replacements, but this is a configuration risk, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O and string replacements based on external input. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or obfuscate logic. The only potential security concern is the external 'keys.txt' file, which could be maliciously crafted, but this does not constitute malware. The script's behavior is deterministic and limited to static text processing.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for batch renaming within scripts/notebooks. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only minor security consideration is reliance on external 'keys.txt', which could be manipulated, but this does not imply malicious activity.",
