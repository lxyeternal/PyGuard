{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process Python or Jupyter Notebook scripts to replace filter names based on a key-value mapping stored in a text file.",
  "sources": "Reading from the local file system: 'keys.txt', input script files or directories provided as arguments",
  "sinks": "File write operations that overwrite the original scripts after modifications",
  "flows": "Read 'keys.txt' -> generate replacement map -> read script files -> replace patterns -> write back to files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The code uses straightforward file I/O and string replacements.",
  "analysis": "The script loads replacement mappings from 'keys.txt', then applies these replacements to either a specific script file or all scripts in a directory. It reads text content, performs string replacements, and writes the modified content back to the files. All operations are standard and do not involve executing untrusted code or communicating over the network. No obfuscated code or hidden functionality is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script designed for batch updating filter names in script files. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Its purpose is to modify scripts based on a predefined mapping, with no indications of security risks.",
