{
  "purpose": "This script replaces filter names in Python or Jupyter Notebook files based on mappings provided in an external keys.txt file.",
  "sources": "Reads input script or directory path from the argument, reads text from files in the directory, reads 'keys.txt' file for replacement mappings.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified text back to the same files, outputs status messages to console.",
  "flows": "Reads file paths and content (sources), performs string replacements (processing), writes back to files (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Uses external 'keys.txt' file for mappings, which could be manipulated to replace code with malicious content, but no direct malicious behavior is evident in the code itself. No network, system, or credential handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads from provided file paths and a 'keys.txt' file, then performs string replacements based on mappings. It modifies files in-place, which could be risky if 'keys.txt' contains malicious instructions or replacements. However, there is no evident malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or privilege escalation. The code is straightforward and designed solely for renaming filter functions or parameters within scripts. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script's functionality is limited to renaming filter identifiers within Python or Jupyter Notebook files. There is no indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The main concern is the reliance on an external 'keys.txt' which could be manipulated, but this alone does not constitute malware. Overall, the code appears benign.",
