  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'requests_pkcs12', including reading version info, description, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'version' file, reading long description from 'README.rst' file",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks",
  "flows": "Source (file reads) -> setup configuration, no untrusted data flows into dangerous functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read files for version and description is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. Dependencies listed are typical, though note that 'cryptography (>=42.0.0)' should be 'cryptography>=42.0.0' (missing '>' symbol).",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup configuration for a Python package, reading version and description from files and specifying dependencies and metadata. No dynamic code execution, no malicious functions, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The only concern is the potential typo in the 'install_requires' list where 'cryptography (>=42.0.0)' should likely be 'cryptography>=42.0.0'. This appears to be a formatting mistake rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard for packaging a Python library, with no malicious code or suspicious behaviors present. The only notable issue is a formatting error in dependencies, which is unrelated to security but should be corrected for proper functionality.",
