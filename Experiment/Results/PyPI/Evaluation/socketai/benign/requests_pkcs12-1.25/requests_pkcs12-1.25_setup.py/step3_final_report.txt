  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading version and description from files, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'version' file, 'README.rst' file, and defines dependencies and metadata within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external system calls or network activity",
  "flows": "File reads supply version and description; dependencies are specified but contain a syntax typo",
  "anomalies": "Typo in dependencies: 'cryptography (>=42.0.0)' instead of 'cryptography>=42.0.0'; no malicious code or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation. The only issue is a syntax error in dependency specification, which could cause installation failure but is not security-related. No suspicious logic, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The reports correctly assign malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a low security risk (~0.1) due to the syntax typo. Overall, the code is benign and safe, with a minor formatting mistake that should be corrected for proper package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is a syntax typo in dependencies, which does not pose a security threat but should be fixed to ensure proper installation. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0.1 is appropriate given the minor syntax issue.",
