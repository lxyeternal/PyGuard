  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is a syntax typo in dependencies, which does not pose a security threat but should be fixed to ensure proper installation. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0.1 is appropriate given the minor syntax issue."
