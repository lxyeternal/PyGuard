  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'requests_pkcs12' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from 'version' file and long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description files during setup; no data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading version and description files, specifying dependencies, and defining package metadata. No code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious constructs are present. Dependencies are listed with version constraints, and no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code are detected. The only potential concern is reading files at setup time, which is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
