  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'requests_pkcs12' Python module, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'version' file, reading long description from 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('version' and 'README.rst') into package setup parameters; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. Use of standard setup tools and straightforward file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. Files are read to populate version and description fields, which is typical. No code execution, no network activity, and no handling of untrusted input are present. The dependencies are standard Python packages, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
