  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility for managing PKCS#12 certificates and making secure HTTPS requests. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. It is safe for use in supply chain contexts, assuming proper handling of sensitive data in deployment."
