      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility for managing PKCS#12 certificates and making secure HTTPS requests. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. It is safe for use in supply chain contexts, assuming proper handling of sensitive data in deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is a syntax typo in dependencies, which does not pose a security threat but should be fixed to ensure proper installation. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0.1 is appropriate given the minor syntax issue."
