  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"0.1.11\"`).\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, or external interactions in any report.\n   - The code is standard for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - None of the reports identify any errors or flaws. The logic is straightforward and correct.\n   - The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, and anomalies are consistently described as benign and typical.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they recognize the code as a standard version declaration.\n   - No report suggests any hidden or obfuscated behavior, which aligns with the code.\n\n5. **Critical Observations**:\n   - The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n   - No modifications or higher scores are warranted.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk associated with this code snippet)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate** aligns perfectly with the reports:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
