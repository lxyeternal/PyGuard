  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a simple string assignment.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a direct assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. The code is minimal, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The simplicity and lack of suspicious features confirm the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are consistent and accurate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
