  "purpose": "Initialize the geneblocks package by importing specific classes and variables from submodules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .proglog and .version modules",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; import statements do not process external input",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simply imports modules and variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements to load specific classes and variables from internal modules. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling that could lead to security issues. The commented out '__all__' line has no effect and does not introduce risk. Overall, this is standard package initialization code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward import operations for package setup and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not pose any security risk.",
