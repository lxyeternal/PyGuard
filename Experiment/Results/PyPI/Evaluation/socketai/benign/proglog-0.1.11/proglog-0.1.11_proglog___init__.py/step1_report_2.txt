  "purpose": "Initialization and import of specific classes and variables from internal modules for the geneblocks package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .proglog and .version modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurring.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file that imports specific components for package initialization. It imports various logging classes and a version string, with no suspicious or malicious activity present. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed, and no sensitive data handling occurs. The structure and content are typical for package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply exposes certain classes and variables for external use.",
