  "purpose": "This code serves as the package initializer, importing various classes and variables from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .proglog and .version modules, reading internal module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Static import of internal module attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out __all__ line; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports specific classes and variables for package setup. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malicious intent or security issues. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package initializer with no security risks or malicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
