{
  "purpose": "This module initializes the geneblocks package by importing various loggers, progress bar handlers, and version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .proglog and .version",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data input or output mechanisms; no external data sinks detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and variables related to logging and progress indication. It does not process user input, handle files, or perform network operations. The absence of any runtime logic, dynamic code execution, or external data handling suggests a benign purpose. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initializer that imports logging and version components. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
