  "purpose": "This module initializes the 'geneblocks' package by importing specific classes and variables from submodules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .proglog (various logger classes and functions), and __version__ from .version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains import statements to expose components of the package. It does not execute any logic, read input, or handle untrusted data. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present. The structure is straightforward, and the code aligns with typical package initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
