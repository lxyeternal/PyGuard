{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the use of the proglog library's TqdmProgressBarLogger to visualize progress in nested loops, with the option to ignore certain progress bars.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the range objects for the loops (main=range(10), sub=range(10)). No external data sources or user inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could leak data or perform unsafe actions are identified. The logger message is a simple print statement.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the range objects into the nested loops, and the logger's iter_bar method controls progress bar visualization. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Usage of time.sleep is benign and intended for demo purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code uses the proglog library to display progress bars during nested loop iterations. The first section displays both 'main' and 'sub' progress bars; the second section disables the 'sub' progress bar via ignored_bars parameter. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The code is straightforward, with clear intent, and uses external library functions safely. No hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for progress visualization during loop execution. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
