{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the TqdmProgressBarLogger to display progress bars for nested loops, with an option to ignore certain bars.",
  "sources": "Imports time module and TqdmProgressBarLogger from proglog; reads data from range objects in loops.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, system calls, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input from range objects flows into loop iterations; progress bar logger methods are invoked during loops; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; code performs straightforward progress bar visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a third-party progress bar library. It creates a logger instance and iterates over nested loops, updating progress bars. It then repeats with ignored bars, but no malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident. The code's structure is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The functionality is typical for progress visualization and monitoring purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely for demonstrating progress bar usage with the proglog library. No malicious intent or security threats are present.",
