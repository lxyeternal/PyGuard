{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the usage of the TqdmProgressBarLogger to show progress bars during nested loop execution, both with and without ignoring certain bars.",
  "sources": "The code reads the range objects for loop iteration, and the logger messages for progress display.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to potential data leaks or effects; the logger messages are straightforward console outputs.",
  "flows": "Input source: range objects for loops; Data flows through logger.iter_bar calls; Output is printed progress bars and messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is simple and clear.",
  "analysis": "The code imports time and a progress bar logger library, then runs nested loops with sleep delays, displaying progress bars. It uses logger to display progress for both outer and inner loops, with an option to ignore certain bars. No untrusted data input, malicious code, or suspicious operations are present. The code is primarily educational or demonstrative, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to demonstrate progress bar usage with the proglog library. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
