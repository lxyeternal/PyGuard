{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates usage of the 'proglog' library for nested progress bars with options to ignore certain bars, serving as a simple example or educational demonstration.",
  "sources": "Range objects in nested loops, logger.iter_bar calls, message parameter in logger for status updates",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or data leaks detected",
  "flows": "Range inputs -> loops -> logger.iter_bar -> console output / progress bars",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of progress bar visualization using a third-party library, with nested loops and optional ignoring of certain bars. It uses standard constructs like range, sleep, and logging messages. No external data sources, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code's intent is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The use of sleep simulates work being done; the logger manages progress display. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for demonstration purposes. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
