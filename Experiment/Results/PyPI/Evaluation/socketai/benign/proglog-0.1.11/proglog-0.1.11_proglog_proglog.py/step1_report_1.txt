{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for logging progress, including progress bars for console and notebooks, with support for custom callbacks and state management.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration settings, input data for progress iterations, and update values for progress bars and state variables.",
  "sinks": "Writes logs to files or standard output, updates progress bars via tqdm, and stores state in memory or in external job objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., iterations, configuration) flows into state updates and progress bar updates; log messages flow into output or files; callback functions may perform additional actions upon state changes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures are present. The code uses standard libraries (tqdm, collections, time) without obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution. No indications of data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for progress logging, including console and notebook-compatible progress bars. It uses standard Python libraries and patterns, with no suspicious network calls or data leaks. Callbacks and storage mechanisms are designed for extensibility and are safe. The use of tqdm for progress visualization and file operations for logs are common and benign. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified. The code appears well-structured for its purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of progress logging utilities with no malicious behavior detected. It operates within expected patterns for such utilities, with no signs of malware, data theft, or security risks.",
