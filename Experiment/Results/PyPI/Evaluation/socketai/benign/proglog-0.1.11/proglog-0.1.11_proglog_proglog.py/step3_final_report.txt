{
  "purpose": "Provides progress logging classes and progress bar visualization, supporting console and notebook interfaces.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from iterables, updates internal state, writes logs to files or stdout, interacts with external job objects for progress data storage.",
  "sinks": "Writes logs to files or console, updates progress bars, updates external job metadata.",
  "flows": "Input iterables -> progress updates -> logs and progress bar updates; external job object -> progress data storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (tqdm, collections, time), with well-structured classes for progress logging. Callbacks and storage methods are designed for extensibility. No network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious data flows. External interactions with job objects are typical for task progress tracking. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard progress logging utility with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The high security risk score in the initial report (0.95) is inflated; a more accurate risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal external interactions but no actual security threat.",
