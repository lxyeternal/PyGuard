  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, scoring appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Clearly states the code provides progress logging classes, with no malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Uses standard libraries (tqdm, collections, time). No obfuscation or hidden logic.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (0.95). No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** This is a well-founded, accurate assessment. The code is a standard progress logger with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code is for progress monitoring, with no external network activity or malicious behavior. Mentions external job objects but no data exfiltration or backdoors.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still high. Security risk is minimal (0.1), which seems acceptable given the code's nature.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The mention of storing progress data in external job objects (e.g., in RqWorkerProgressLogger) could be a minor concern if the external job object is untrusted, but in isolation, this is a common pattern. No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; the slight security risk is justified due to external storage, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports; confirms no malicious behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The risk score is slightly above zero, justified by the potential for logs or progress data to be sensitive, but no actual security issue.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, confirms no malicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Focuses on standard progress visualization, safe use of external libraries.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very high confidence (1).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** The minimal security risk is justified, mainly because logs can contain sensitive info, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar assessment—no malicious activity, straightforward progress management, no obfuscation, no network activity.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** The absence of any suspicious features supports these scores.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code uses standard libraries, no obfuscated or suspicious logic.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the potential sensitivity of logs or external storage, but no real security risk is present.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (No signs of malware or malicious code)  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (Code is straightforward, no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (Minimal, mostly due to potential sensitive info in logs or external storage, but not a security threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified in their scoring. The code is a standard, safe progress logging utility with no malicious intent.",
