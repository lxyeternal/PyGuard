{
  "purpose": "Provides classes for progress logging and visual progress bars, including console, notebook, and asynchronous (RQ) integrations.",
  "sources": "Reading input data: None explicitly, but internal data structures and optional file operations in dump_logs. No external input sources like network or user input are evident.",
  "sinks": "Writing logs to file via dump_logs, printing messages in notebooks or console, updating progress bars (potentially revealing internal progress states).",
  "flows": "Method calls update internal state; logs and progress updates are communicated via print, file, or progress bar updates. No external data flow or untrusted input handling is explicitly evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names. The code primarily manages progress visualization and logging without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines progress logging classes, including progress bars for console and Jupyter notebooks, with optional file logging. It manages internal state updates, optional file output, and visual progress display. No network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for progress visualization and logging, with customizable callbacks and handling for progress bars, including ignored or logged bars. Overall, it functions as a standard progress logger with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard progress logging utility with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is designed for logging and visualizing progress during tasks and does not contain any harmful operations or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
