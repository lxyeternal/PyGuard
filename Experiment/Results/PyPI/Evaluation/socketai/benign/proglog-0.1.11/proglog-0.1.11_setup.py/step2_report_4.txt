  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- The main point of concern across reports is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `version.py`.\n- None of the reports identify actual malicious activity or code, only potential risks associated with executing external code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence:\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code provided.\n- The use of `exec()` to load version info from `proglog/version.py` is consistent.\n\n### Are the reported issues present?\n- **Yes.** The primary \"issue\" discussed is the use of `exec()` for dynamic version loading, which is a known pattern but can be risky if the `version.py` file is compromised.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports correctly identify that `exec()` could be a security concern if the `version.py` file is malicious. However, they also correctly note that this pattern is common in setup scripts.\n- No report claims that malicious code is present; they only mention potential risks.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with their conclusion that no malicious activity is detected.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the potential concern with `exec()`.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the standard nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the reports assign a malware score of 0, and the code contains no actual malicious code, a malware score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The potential risk from `exec()` is acknowledged but not considered malicious, so the overall risk score should remain low.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent but acknowledge the potential risk associated with executing external code.\n- This is reasonable and aligns with best practices for cautious security assessment.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the conclusions of each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code is a typical setup script.**  \n- **The main concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which could be risky if the version file is compromised.**  \n- **No actual malware or malicious behavior is present.**  \n- **Scores assigned are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to the `exec()` pattern, which could be risky if the version file is compromised, but is common practice)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. They correctly identify the standard nature of the code, the potential security concern with `exec()`, but find no evidence of malicious activity. The scoring aligns well with the findings.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low security risk score (~0.2) to reflect the potential concern with executing external code, but overall, the code is safe in its current form.",
