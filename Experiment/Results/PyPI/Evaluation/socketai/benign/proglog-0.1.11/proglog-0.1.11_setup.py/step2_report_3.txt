  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies, standard setup script, no malicious behavior, uses exec() for version loading which is common.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0 — justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Uses exec() to load version info, which could be risky if 'version.py' is malicious.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.8.  \n- **Analysis:** The risk stems from exec(), but it's a common pattern. The report correctly notes that unless 'version.py' is malicious, there's no actual threat.  \n- **Verdict:** The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the potential, but not confirmed maliciousness.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to above, standard setup script, uses exec() for version.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.  \n- **Analysis:** Slightly lower risk score, which is appropriate given the context.  \n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern, no malicious activity, standard setup.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Confidence=1.  \n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies no security risk.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard setup, exec() usage is common but could be risky if 'version.py' is compromised.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Confidence=0.9.  \n- **Analysis:** Consistent with prior reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports assign malware=0, which aligns with the code's behavior. No actual malicious code or network activity is detected.  \n- **Obfuscated code:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; all assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Risk scores:** The only concern is the use of 'exec()' to load version info. While common, it could be risky if the 'version.py' file is compromised or malicious. The reports assign a low risk score (0.1-0.2), which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n**Overall,** the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent. The main security concern is the use of 'exec()' for version loading, which is a known pattern but could be exploited if the source file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — slightly elevated due to 'exec()' usage, but standard practice in many setup scripts, assuming trusted source files.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious setup script with a minor security concern related to executing external code for versioning. No malware or obfuscation present. The risk score could be marginally increased if there were doubts about the integrity of 'version.py', but as it stands, 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, with a note that replacing 'exec()' with safer alternatives (like importing the version directly) could mitigate this minimal risk.",
