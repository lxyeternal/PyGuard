  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'proglog' Python package, including versioning, description, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'proglog/version.py' via exec(), reads long description from 'pypi-readme.rst'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or user input involved.",
  "flows": "exec() executes code from 'version.py' to assign version; file reading for description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info could execute malicious code if 'version.py' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script. It uses exec() to dynamically load version info, which is common but can be risky if the source file is malicious. No other suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code reads local files and performs package setup tasks. The potential security concern is the exec() call, which could execute arbitrary code if 'version.py' is malicious or altered. No network activity or data leaks are evident. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The risk score could be slightly elevated due to exec(), so approximately 0.2 is justified, assuming the source files are trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with a minor security concern related to the use of exec() for version loading. No malicious activity is present. The scores should be: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, consistent with the potential risk from exec() usage.",
