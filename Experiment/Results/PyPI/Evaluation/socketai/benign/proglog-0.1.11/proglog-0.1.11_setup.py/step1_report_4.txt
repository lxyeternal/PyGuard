{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'proglog', including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'proglog/version.py' file for version info; reading 'pypi-readme.rst' for long description; static imports and function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used; all data sources are static or local files.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file → passes version to setup; reads long description from local file → used in setup; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard setup tasks with safe file reads and no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools, dynamically loads version info via exec (which is common in setup scripts), and reads a README file for long description. All file accesses are local and static. There are no user inputs, network connections, or data manipulations that could lead to security issues. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads local files for versioning and description, using common patterns in Python packaging.",
