{
  "purpose": "To demonstrate the usage of the proglog library's progress bar functionality with nested loops and simulated delay.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'iterations' and 'logger'; the 'time.sleep' function.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The 'logger.iter_bar' generates progress bars from input data; 'time.sleep' introduces delay but no data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, runs nested loops with progress bars, and simulates processing time with sleep. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The logic is benign, serving as a demonstration of a progress bar library. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malware-like activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign demonstration of progress bar usage with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply shows progress bar rendering with simulated delays.",
