{
  "purpose": "The code runs a demonstration of progress bars using the proglog library, iterating over a range and a list of animals with simulated delays.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'iterations' parameter and the 'animal' list for the loop.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects external systems, leaks, or causes harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters into loops, with no external or untrusted data influencing the behavior beyond predefined inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code uses a third-party library without suspicious modifications. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard time and a third-party progress logging library. It defines a function to run nested loops, displaying progress bars, with simulated delays. The loops iterate over a numeric range and a static list of animals. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data processing. The code appears to be for demonstration purposes only, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign demonstration of progress bars using a third-party library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
