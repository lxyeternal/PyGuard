{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates usage of the 'proglog' library to run nested progress bars with simulated delay.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'iterations' parameter and the 'logger' string parameter; calls 'logger.iter_bar' with 'range(iterations)' and a list of animals.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink functions or untrusted data flows; no data leakage or external data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (iterations, logger) influence the progress bar loops; no data flows outside the local scope or to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard usage of a known progress logging library; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a timing function and a progress bar logger from a third-party library. It defines a function to run nested loops with progress bars, simulating work with time.sleep. The code uses user-defined parameters for iterations and logger type but does not process or transmit untrusted data or perform any insecure operations. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of a progress bar library with simulated delays. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
