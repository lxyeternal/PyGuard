  "purpose": "Demonstration of nested progress bars using the proglog library with simulated delays.",
  "sources": "Standard input via function parameters, proglog's iter_bar method, time.sleep for simulation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to iter_bar calls, which generate progress updates; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of third-party library and standard functions without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, defines a routine that runs nested progress bars with simulated delays, and executes it. No external data handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The use of third-party progress bar library is standard, and the delays are for simulation only. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign, demonstrative nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
