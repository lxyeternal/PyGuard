  "purpose": "Demonstration of progress bar logging using 'proglog' library with simulated workload.",
  "sources": "Standard library 'time' for sleep; 'proglog' for progress bars and logging.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Progress loops from 'my_routine' to 'logger.iter_bar' with sleep delays; no external data flow or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, runs nested progress bars, and simulates workload via sleep. No external data, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The logic is simple and intended for demonstration. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of progress bar usage with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
