  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of the Proglog library for progress bar logging during iterative routines.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'time' module and 'proglog' library; function parameters and logger initialization within 'my_routine' and test functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external data exfiltration. No network, file, or environment variable usage found.",
  "flows": "Input to 'my_routine' via 'iterations' and 'logger' parameters; 'logger' flows into the iteration process; no external flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code employs standard logging and sleeping functions with no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries for progress logging and simulates workload via time.sleep. It uses safe and typical patterns for progress indication. No hardcoded secrets, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior detected. The 'proglog' library is a legitimate package used for progress bars. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The code is straightforward and intended for demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning solely to demonstrate progress bar logging with no malicious intent or security issues.",
