{
  "purpose": "The code patches pytest source files to replace calls to 'callable()' with 'py.builtin.callable()' for Python 3.1 compatibility.",
  "sources": "Environment scanner to locate pytest installation, reading source files (e.g., runner.py).",
  "sinks": "Modifies source code files by regex replacement.",
  "flows": "Environment detection → file reading → regex matching → source code modification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious activity; straightforward regex-based source patching.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment scanning to find pytest, then reads the target source file, identifies lines calling 'callable()' via regex, and replaces them with 'py.builtin.callable()'. It ensures safe file handling and only modifies specific lines for compatibility. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The purpose is legitimate, and the code is clear and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, targeted patching utility for pytest compatibility. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The activity is limited to source code modification for a known purpose, with no malicious intent.",
