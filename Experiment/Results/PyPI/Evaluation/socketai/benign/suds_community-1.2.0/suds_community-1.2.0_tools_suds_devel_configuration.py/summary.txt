  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration utility with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. The only improvement would be to update the deprecated 'readfp' method to 'read_file' for future compatibility, but this does not impact security."
