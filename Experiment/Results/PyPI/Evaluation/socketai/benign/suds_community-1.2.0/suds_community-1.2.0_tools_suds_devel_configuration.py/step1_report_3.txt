  "purpose": "This script provides configuration handling support for development utility scripts, including reading environment variables, configuration files, and managing project and script folders.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via 'Environment' class, reads configuration file from specified path.",
  "sinks": "Reads data from configuration files and environment, but does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration file -> parses options -> loads environment commands -> sets internal attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code. Use of 'print' for status message is harmless. No dynamic code execution or external network connections observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads configuration files and environment variables, handles errors properly, and performs no suspicious or malicious actions. No hardcoded secrets, external data transmission, or backdoors are evident. The imported modules are standard or non-suspicious. The code's structure is conventional and maintains security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration management utility without malicious intent or security risks. It reads local configuration files and environment variables securely and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
