  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header, module documentation, and author metadata, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "N/A (no data input or external data sources present).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink data flows).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only comments, docstring, and author info present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments, a module docstring, and author metadata, with no executable statements or data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The content is purely informational and standard for package headers. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence is high (1) due to the straightforward and non-executable content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, non-executable header or license comment block with no security concerns, malicious activity, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
