  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header or metadata comment block for a Python package, describing licensing and authorship information.",
  "sources": "No executable code or data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input-output paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, or data handling makes the code structurally benign. No suspicious or unusual code segments are identified.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a module docstring. There are no functions, data processing, or data input/output mechanisms present that could be exploited or contain malicious logic. The comments are standard licensing notices, and the docstring describes the module's purpose. Without executable code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. Therefore, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is harmless, containing only license information and a descriptive docstring. It does not include any executable or malicious code. No security risks are present based on this snippet.",
