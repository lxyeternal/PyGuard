  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and primarily consists of licensing comments and a docstring. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated content are present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing information, a module docstring, and author metadata. There are no executable statements, input/output operations, or third-party library calls. It appears to be a boilerplate or stub file meant for documentation and package structure. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a descriptive or structural part of a larger project. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. The lack of executable content or data handling indicates a very low risk profile.",
