  "sinks": "exec() call on 'version.py' to load version info.",
  "flows": "Source: read_python_code() -> exec() on 'version.py' -> package setup routines.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute local version file; creation of dummy files for setup process.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup script that performs environment validation, package discovery, and loads version info via exec(). The use of exec() on a local, controlled file like 'version.py' is common in setup routines but could pose a security risk if the file is tampered with. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious code is present. The dummy file creation is benign. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscated score is zero; the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to exec(). Overall, the code appears legitimate, with minimal security concerns primarily centered on the integrity of 'version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is executing local code via exec(), which is standard but should be secured by verifying the 'version.py' file. No evidence of supply chain compromise or malware is present.",
