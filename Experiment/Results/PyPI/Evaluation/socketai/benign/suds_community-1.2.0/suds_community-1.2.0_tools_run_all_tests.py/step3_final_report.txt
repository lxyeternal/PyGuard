  "purpose": "A development script used to run tests across multiple Python environments for the suds-jurko project, orchestrating build and test commands.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (setup.cfg), environment objects (env), and external command executions via env.execute()",
  "sinks": "External commands executed through env.execute(), which invoke setup.py and pytest",
  "flows": "Configuration reading -> environment setup -> execution of build/test commands -> status reporting",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward testing orchestration script that manages environment configurations, executes build and test commands, and reports outcomes. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications. External command execution is standard for such scripts and is controlled within a testing context. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's purpose and behavior are consistent with benign development utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard testing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code's content and behavior.",
