  "purpose": "Manage Python version-specific dependency requirements for the project, ensuring compatibility across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads system version info via sys.version_info; imports custom utility functions for requirement specification.",
  "sinks": "Generates requirement specification strings; does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → requirement_spec calls → requirement strings",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that checks the Python environment version and yields dependency requirements accordingly. It imports standard modules and project-specific utilities, performs simple comparisons, and generates requirement specifications. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or code execution that could be malicious. The code is well-documented, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign dependency management script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static dependency specification utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for use.",
