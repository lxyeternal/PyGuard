  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily about dependency management, version compatibility, and requirement specification.\n- It imports standard modules (`sys`) and project-specific utilities (`suds_devel.parse_version`, `suds_devel.utility`).\n- The functions generate version-specific requirement strings based on `sys.version_info`.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network or file operations, and no code execution beyond version comparisons.\n- The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose is clearly to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility.\n\n**Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious code, payloads, or behaviors. The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n- **Obfuscated:** The code is straightforward, well-commented, and uses clear logic. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** The code does not process untrusted input, access sensitive data, or perform risky operations. The only potential concern could be dependency on external modules, but they are imported explicitly and are part of the project.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The code does not process or output untrusted data.\n- It does not execute external commands or modify the environment beyond generating requirement specifications.\n- The license comments are standard and do not contain malicious content.\n- The functions rely on system version info and utility functions, which are presumably safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a benign dependency management utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code is a typical, safe utility for dependency specification based on Python version, with no signs of compromise or malicious behavior.",
