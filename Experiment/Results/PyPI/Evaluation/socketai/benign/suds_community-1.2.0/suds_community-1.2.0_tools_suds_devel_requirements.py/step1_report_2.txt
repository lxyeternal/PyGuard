{
  "purpose": "The code provides package requirements and version compatibility checks for a Python project, mainly for dependency management and environment setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's Python version info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading system version info and generating dependency requirements based on that info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code mainly handles version checks and dependency specifications.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and custom utility functions, then defines a class and a function to generate dependency requirements based on Python version info. There is no code that reads external input, interacts with networks, or executes untrusted code. It appears to be a typical dependency management utility with version-specific logic, and it does not contain obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for dependency specification based on Python version. It contains no malicious behavior, no hidden backdoors, and no security risks. It simply manages dependencies for compatibility purposes.",
