  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a version parsing utility adapted from setuptools, intended to convert version strings into comparable tuples.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, well-documented, and performs version normalization without external side effects.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, data leaks, or obfuscation are detected.\n- The code uses standard regex and string processing techniques, with no external network calls or data handling beyond internal parsing.\n\n**Confirmations and issues:**\n\n- The code does not contain any signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The logic is clear, and the reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned for malware (0) and security risk (0) are appropriate based on the provided code.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n\n- The only possible point of contention could be the handling of version strings, but since the code is a known utility from setuptools and the parsing logic is standard, this does not constitute a security issue.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly set to 0.\n- The overall security risk score is appropriately 0, as there's no indication of vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- The detailed analysis supports that this is a standard version parsing utility with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
