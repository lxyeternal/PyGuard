  "purpose": "Utility for converting version strings into a directly comparable tuple, facilitating version comparison and normalization.",
  "sources": "Reads version string input passed to parse_version, internally uses regex splitting and string normalization.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; processes data internally without network, file, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> regex split and normalization -> yield parts -> assemble tuple for comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, adapted from setuptools, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex to tokenize version strings, normalizes pre-release tags, pads numeric parts for comparison, and appends a final marker. It is a standard utility for version normalization, with clear comments and no external data handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is safe, well-understood, and consistent with benign version parsing functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented version string parser adapted from setuptools. It performs no malicious actions, contains no obfuscation, and poses no security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
