{
  "purpose": "The code is a utility for converting version strings into a comparable tuple format for sorting and comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads version strings passed to the parse_version function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows to external systems or outputs; it only processes and returns data.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> _parse_version_parts -> parse_version (main flow: parsing and transforming version strings) -> output tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns. The license comments and code structure are standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 're' for regex operations and defines functions to parse and normalize version strings for comparison. It compiles a regex pattern for tokenizing version components, and uses a mapping 'replace' for specific pre-release tags. The functions split the input string into components, normalize them by padding numeric parts, and handle pre-release identifiers systematically. No external data is fetched, nor are there any code injections or obfuscated patterns. The overall structure is consistent with a version parsing utility, with comments explaining its purpose and logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for version string parsing, with no indications of malware or security risks. It is well-documented and does not contain suspicious behaviors or external communications.",
