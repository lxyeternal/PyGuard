  "purpose": "Utility for converting version strings into a directly comparable tuple for sorting and comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "Import of 're' module; input version strings to the 'parse_version' function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform data output, network operations, or external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> '_parse_version_parts' parsing -> 'parse_version' processing -> output tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a regular expression module and defines functions to parse and normalize version strings into sortable tuples. It includes version replacement mappings and handles pre-release identifiers and numeric padding for comparison. There are no external calls, network operations, or data leaks. The code is well-structured, includes licensing comments, and is consistent with standard version parsing logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code insertion are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version string parsing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves a benign purpose for version comparison and sorting. There are no indicators of malware or security issues.",
