  "purpose": "Utility for converting version strings into a directly comparable tuple for sorting and comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input version strings passed to the parse_version function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not output untrusted data or perform any data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> _parse_version_parts -> parse_version, producing a tuple for comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code solely performs string parsing and transformation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports re for regular expressions, defines a regex for splitting version strings, and a replace mapping for certain version labels. It defines functions to parse version parts, pad numeric parts, and convert version strings into sortable tuples. The functions do not perform any external actions, data collection, or malicious activities. The code appears to be a standard, well-documented version parsing utility adapted from a known package (setuptools), with no suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version string parser, intended to facilitate version comparisons. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a benign utility function with no security concerns.",
