  "purpose": "Utility for converting version strings into a directly comparable, sortable tuple for version comparison.",
  "sources": "Import of 're' module, use of 're.compile' to create regex pattern, functions '_parse_version_parts' and 'parse_version' processing input version strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data handling or external data streams identified.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> regex split -> version parts transformation -> output tuple for comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscation; code is straightforward and intended for version string parsing. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module to compile a regex pattern that splits version strings into components. The '_parse_version_parts' function replaces certain pre-release indicators with canonical forms, filters out irrelevant parts, pads numeric parts for consistent comparison, and adds a final token to standardize version order. The 'parse_version' function orchestrates the parsing process, transforming version strings into tuples that can be compared chronologically. The logic is clear, purposeful, and does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no data leaks, network communications, or hidden behaviors. All operations relate solely to version string processing with no external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for parsing version strings into comparable tuples. It is a known pattern adapted from setuptools code, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
