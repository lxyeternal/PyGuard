  "purpose": "Utility for converting version strings into a directly comparable, sortable tuple",
  "sources": "import re, variable definitions, regex pattern, replace function, _parse_version_parts, parse_version",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to process untrusted input in a way that would lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities. No external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input version string is split, processed, and transformed into a tuple for comparison; no external data flow or output is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code strictly performs string parsing and version normalization without hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library (re) and defines regex patterns for parsing version strings. It includes a replace mapping for version tags, and functions for parsing and converting version strings into comparable tuples. The logic handles pre-release tags, numeric padding, and string normalization. There are no code injections, data leaks, network activity, or malicious functions. The functions are straightforward and serve version comparison purposes. The code lacks external data interaction, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility for version string handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for version string parsing and comparison. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is safe and aligns with open-source version handling practices.",
