{
  "purpose": "Provide utilities for compressing folder contents into a zip archive, primarily for packaging or backup purposes.",
  "sources": "User-defined folder path input via function parameters; no direct external data sources read by the code itself.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to zip files using zipfile.ZipFile.write() and writestr(), which are safe; no external data sink that leaks data or executes code.",
  "flows": "Folder path input is used to generate zip archives; no flow from untrusted sources to critical functions that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of sys.version_info for compatibility is standard. The code handles zip compression dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The script implements folder zipping functionality with careful handling of folder structures and compatibility considerations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior detected. No external data is processed beyond standard filesystem operations. The code's purpose is benign, aimed at archiving directory contents.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility for compressing folders into zip archives. It exhibits no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
