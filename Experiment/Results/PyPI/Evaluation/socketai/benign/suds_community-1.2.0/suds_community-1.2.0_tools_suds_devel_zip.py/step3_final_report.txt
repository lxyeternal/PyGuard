  "sinks": "zipfile.ZipFile.write() and writestr() methods for adding files and directories to the archive.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data flows from os.walk through add_folder_with_files() into the zip archive via write and writestr methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation detected. External utility 'path_iter' appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard directory traversal and zipping operations with proper resource cleanup and error handling. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates benign utility code. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The external dependency 'path_iter' is a typical utility for path handling and does not introduce risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for creating ZIP archives from folder contents. It exhibits no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a minimal security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
