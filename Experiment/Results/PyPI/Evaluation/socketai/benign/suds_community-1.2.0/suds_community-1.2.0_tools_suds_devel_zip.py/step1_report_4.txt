  "purpose": "Utility functions for zip file creation and folder archiving.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'folder' path input, system modules (os, sys), and zipfile module.",
  "sinks": "Uses zipfile.write() and writestr() to add files and folders to a zip archive.",
  "flows": "Input folder path -> os.walk -> files list -> zipfile.write() / writestr() -> zip archive.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No network activity, no data exfiltration, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utilities for zipping folder contents, constructing zip archives, and handling folder structures. It dynamically determines compression method based on environment. The code appears well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. No inputs are directly used in a harmful way, and file writing operations are limited to creating zip archives from specified directories. The code does not include any network activity, external data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. All functions perform standard file and directory handling for compression purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for folder compression. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indications. There are no security risks or suspicious patterns present. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use.",
