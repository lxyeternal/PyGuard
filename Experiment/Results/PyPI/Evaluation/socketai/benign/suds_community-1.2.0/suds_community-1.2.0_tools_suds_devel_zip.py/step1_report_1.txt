  "purpose": "Utilities for zipping folder contents, including creating zip archives with proper folder structure.",
  "sources": "Reads input directory paths, folder names, and files from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Uses zipfile.ZipFile.write() to add files to archive; potentially writes to specified zip file location.",
  "flows": "Folder path and file list inputs → add_folder_with_files() → zipfile.ZipFile.write() / writestr() → zip archive creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls. Uses standard libraries only. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script provides functions for creating zip archives from specified folders, handling directory traversal with os.walk(). It manages zip file creation and cleanup, including removing incomplete zip files if errors occur. No user input parsing, environment variables, or network communication observed. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated sections. It does rely on external library 'suds_devel.utility' for 'path_iter', but this appears to be a utility function for path iteration, not suspicious. No evidence of malicious behavior or security issues such as data leakage or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard zip archiving functions with proper resource management. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign utility module.",
