  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in utility modules, specifically for environment setup errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists involving external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward Python class definitions for custom exceptions. It contains licensing information, comments, and a single class with an initializer. There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution. The code adheres to standard Python practices without any signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python utility module defining exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
