  "purpose": "Define custom exception class for environment setup errors in utility modules.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition for a custom exception inheriting from Exception, with an init method that calls the parent constructor. There are no external data sources, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behaviors. The licensing comments are standard legal notices and do not pose security risks. The overall structure is simple and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for Python modules.",
