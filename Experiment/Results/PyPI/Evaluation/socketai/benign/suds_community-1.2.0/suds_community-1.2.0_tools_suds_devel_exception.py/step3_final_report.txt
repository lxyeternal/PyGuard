  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'EnvironmentSetupError' for signaling environment setup failures.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; the class constructor takes a message parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input message flows from constructor parameter to base Exception class; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard exception class with licensing comments and docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python exception class with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It contains licensing comments and a simple constructor that forwards a message. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is purely to signal environment setup errors, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python utility class defining a custom exception with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate, and no modifications to scores are necessary.",
