{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tabulator' Python package, configuring installation, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package version from 'VERSION' file, reading README.md for long description, defining dependencies, and setting up entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no code execution, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Read files -> define package info -> call setup() with configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. Use of 'io.open' is standard for reading files. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity embedded.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files for package metadata and dependencies, then invokes setuptools.setup() with the collected data. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed. The dependencies are standard and explicitly listed, with no indication of malicious or obfuscated code. Entry point specifies a console script, which is typical for CLI tools. No code injections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code performs normal package setup operations with no suspicious elements.",
