  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that prepares the package for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading package version from a VERSION file, reading README.md for long description, importing setup utilities, and defining dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; all data sources are static files or predefined variables.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> setting package metadata and dependencies -> configuring setup() -> defining entry points for command-line interface.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to follow standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package version and README content from static files, then configures setup parameters such as package info, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The dependencies listed are standard, well-known packages. The setup configuration appears conventional and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
