  "purpose": "The code is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'tabulator', including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package files (e.g., README.md, VERSION) and defining package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, user input, or environment variables are present.",
  "flows": "The script reads package information from files, then passes configuration data to the setup() function for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code strictly handles setup configuration without dynamic code execution or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup via setuptools, reading static files and defining dependencies and metadata. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data. No malicious code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code structure aligns with standard package setup scripts, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and solely for package configuration purposes.",
