  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup configuration for 'tabulator', reading static files and defining dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external data flows; static files are read, and configuration data is passed to `setup()`.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard for packaging.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, safe, and standard. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, correctly describes reading static files and setting up package info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; static files and predefined variables are used.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; use of `io.open` is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard setup script. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the script reads version info and README, then configures setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; static files and variables are used.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard packaging practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, benign, and standard. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; reads version and README, sets dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external command execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; straightforward setup code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious elements; standard setup script. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; static data is used.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard, with no malicious behavior. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the script as a benign setup configuration.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the consistent, standard nature of this setup script, and the absence of any suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:** The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
