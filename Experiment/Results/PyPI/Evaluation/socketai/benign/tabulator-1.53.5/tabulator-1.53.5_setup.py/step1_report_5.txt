{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tabulator' Python package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and entry points for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Read function reads the README.md and VERSION files; other data comes from static strings and variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; no code executes untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Reading files for version and README; static data used for setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; the code follows standard setup.py practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a helper to read files, and prepares package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious patterns. The dependencies are specified with fixed version constraints. Entry points for CLI are standard. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It primarily manages package metadata and dependencies without executing any malicious or suspicious code.",
