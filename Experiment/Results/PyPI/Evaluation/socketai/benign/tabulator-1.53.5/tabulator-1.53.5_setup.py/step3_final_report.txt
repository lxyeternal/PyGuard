{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup configuration script for the 'tabulator' Python package, responsible for reading static files (README.md, VERSION) and defining package dependencies, metadata, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static files such as README.md and VERSION, as well as predefined variables for dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted input or perform external actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Reading static files into variables, then passing these variables to the setup() function; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard practices for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It reads static files for versioning and description, defines dependencies, and configures package metadata and entry points. There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. The use of io.open and find_packages is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
