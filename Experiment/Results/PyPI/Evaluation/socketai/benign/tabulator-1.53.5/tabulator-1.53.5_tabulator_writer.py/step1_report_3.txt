  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data writers with methods to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "sources": "None, no input data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this code as it only declares an abstract class with method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of future imports and six library for compatibility suggests code intended for cross-version compatibility; no unusual or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Writer' intended for subclassing to implement specific data writing behavior. It includes abstract method 'write' with parameters for source, target, headers, and encoding. No data processing, input/output operations, or network activity is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are observable. The structure appears typical for a plugin or API interface definition, with no suspicious or anomalous code. No obfuscated code or malware-like patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard abstract class definition for data writers, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
