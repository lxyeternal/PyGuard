  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data writers with customizable options and a write method.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code defines an abstract class structure, not data input points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class only declares an interface without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of future imports, six, and abstract base class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. It uses standard Python compatibility imports and defines an interface for subclasses. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The class is designed solely for extension, with no embedded code that could be malicious or obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard abstract class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
