{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data writer implementations.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; code does not read external input or data.",
  "targets": "None; no data is written or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Code uses `from __future__` imports and six for compatibility; no suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class `Writer` with an abstract method `write`. It imports modules for compatibility and abstracts data writing functionality without performing actual operations. There are no input/output reading, data leaks, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless abstract class definition for data writers, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
