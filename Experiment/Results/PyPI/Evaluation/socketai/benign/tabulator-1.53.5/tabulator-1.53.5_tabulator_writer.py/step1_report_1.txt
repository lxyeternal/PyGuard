{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data writers that can be extended to support different file destinations.",
  "sources": "None, the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None, the code does not write data or send data to untrusted locations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard class definition and abstract method declarations; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, uses six for compatibility, and defines an abstract class 'Writer' with an options attribute and an abstract 'write' method. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data handling is present. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured base class intended for extension.\nThere are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The structure is clear, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. It does not perform any actions beyond class and method definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract base class intended for defining data writers. It contains no malicious or suspicious code and poses no security risks. It serves as a foundation for further implementation.",
