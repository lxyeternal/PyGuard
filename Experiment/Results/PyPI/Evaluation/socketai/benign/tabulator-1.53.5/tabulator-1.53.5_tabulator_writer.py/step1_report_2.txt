  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data writers with a method to write data from source to target.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input data read operations present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is written or transmitted in this code.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of abstract methods and class structure is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Writer' with an abstract method 'write'. It uses standard Python features, including future imports and six for compatibility. No input/output operations, network access, or handling of untrusted data is evident. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured abstract class definition intended for subclassing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
