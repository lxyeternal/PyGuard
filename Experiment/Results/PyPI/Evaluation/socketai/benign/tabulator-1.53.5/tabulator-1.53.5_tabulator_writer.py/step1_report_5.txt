{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Writer' for data writing implementations, allowing subclasses to implement the 'write' method for writing source data to a target.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameters in the 'write' method: 'source', 'target', 'headers', and 'encoding'. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'source' data and 'target' location where data is written. The actual writing logic is not implemented here, as this is an abstract class.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'source' and 'target' could flow into subclasses' implementation of 'write'. Since this is an abstract class, no specific flow logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code uses standard imports and defines a typical abstract base class with no unusual code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, uses 'six' for compatibility, and defines an abstract class 'Writer' with an abstract method 'write'. It provides a clear template for subclasses. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured base class for data writers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract class defining a template for data writers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no malicious code, and no security risks identified. It is a benign, structural piece of code meant to be extended.",
