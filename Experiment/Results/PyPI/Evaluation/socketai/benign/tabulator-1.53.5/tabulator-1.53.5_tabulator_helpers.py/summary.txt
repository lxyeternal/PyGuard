  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions typical in data processing pipelines, with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The potential misuse of dynamic import and URI functions warrants cautious input validation in production, but overall, the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use. The scores are justified and should remain as is."
