  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores based on the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for source detection, encoding, stream handling, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Use of URL parsing, environment variables, streams, dynamic import.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, only standard utility functions. Dynamic import_attribute could be misused if given malicious paths, but it relies on trusted input.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard utility code. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2 (low, due to dynamic import potential misuse)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. The only slight concern is the dynamic import, but it's a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with emphasis on data source detection and encoding.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import_attribute and requote_uri handling untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, only standard functions. The dynamic import and URI functions could be misused but are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, safe utility functions.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2 (due to dynamic import and URI handling)  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, similar scope.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potentially unsafe URL handling and dynamic import.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, just standard utility functions. The dynamic import and URL functions could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, including hashing, stream handling, dynamic import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses import_module, os, hashlib, which could be misused if given malicious input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code; functions are standard. Dynamic import is a potential risk but not malicious in itself.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, with emphasis on dynamic import and URI handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Dynamic import_attribute and requote_uri.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, but dynamic import and URI functions could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Still, no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, but a note on cautious handling of untrusted input.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** The consistent 0.2 reflects the minor potential misuse of dynamic import and URI functions if untrusted input is provided. This is a reasonable and cautious assessment.\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions typical in data processing pipelines.\n- No malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation is evident.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only caveat is the use of dynamic import and URI handling functions, which should be used with validated input in a real-world scenario, but this does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My Personal Scores:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (due to potential misuse, but not malicious)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, well-structured, and safe for use in a supply chain context, with only minor potential misuse considerations that do not elevate the risk to a significant level.",
