  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no malicious code, benign behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The functions are standard, no malicious payloads. The only minor concern is the dynamic import_attribute, which could be misused if given malicious paths, but this is a controlled pattern assuming trusted input.\n- **Assessment:** The score seems appropriate. The low security risk reflects the potential misuse of dynamic import, but overall benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, standard operations, potential misuse in dynamic import and URI handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above; no malicious code detected. Dynamic import and requote_uri are standard but could be misused if inputs are malicious.\n- **Assessment:** Scores are reasonable. The risk score remains low, given no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no malicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Same as above; functions are standard, no malicious code, minimal security concern.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, potential concern with dynamic import and URL processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Dynamic import and URL requoting are standard but could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Still, no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score remains low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, dynamic attribute access, potential exploitation if untrusted input is provided.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** The main concern is the dynamic import_attribute and getattr, which could be exploited if supplied with malicious module or attribute names. However, within the scope of this code, no malicious payloads are present.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration activities.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports, reflecting potential misuse of dynamic import and URI functions if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slight potential if untrusted inputs are fed into dynamic functions, but overall low.\n\n**Note:** The only area warranting cautious handling is the dynamic import_attribute function, which could be exploited if external input is malicious. However, in the context of this utility module, such risks are well-understood and manageable.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are reasonable and justified based on the code review. The code is standard utility code with no malicious intent or behavior. The minor security concern relates to the potential misuse of dynamic imports and URI processing, but this does not elevate the risk score significantly given no evidence of actual malicious activity.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. No adjustments needed.",
