  "purpose": "Utility functions for detecting data source schemes, encoding, HTML, resetting streams, handling directories, URI requoting, dynamic imports, options extraction, value stringification, and a wrapper class for bytes stats tracking.",
  "sources": "Reading from streams, string inputs, URL parsing, file system checks, encoding detection, and dynamic attribute imports.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe URL handling via requote_uri, dynamic import_attribute, and OS operations like ensure_dir.",
  "flows": "Input data (streams, strings, URLs) processed through detection and normalization functions; dynamic imports and file system operations are performed, with some data potentially used for network or file handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of dynamic import and URL manipulation functions could be misused in certain contexts, but are standard utility functions. No obfuscated code or suspicious data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for data handling, encoding detection, URL processing, directory creation, and dynamic attribute import. The functions perform legitimate tasks without suspicious logic or malicious intent. There are no signs of malware such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage code. The URL requote function uses 'requests.utils.requote_uri' safely, and other functions involve straightforward file and data processing. The dynamic import and option extraction are typical patterns, not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be benign and intended for data source detection and normalization.",
  "conclusion": "This source code consists of utility functions for data handling and detection, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs legitimate operations common in data processing libraries. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
