  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details provided and the context of supply chain security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for source detection, encoding detection, stream handling, URI processing, dynamic importing, options extraction, value stringification, and byte stream stats tracking.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; standard utility functions. Dynamic import_attribute could be exploited if given malicious paths, but relies on trusted input.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, due to potential misuse of dynamic import with untrusted input.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is benign, with standard practices. The dynamic import is a potential vector if misused, but within this code, it appears controlled.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions, with emphasis on data source detection, encoding, stream handling, URI processing, and dynamic imports.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code; functions are straightforward. The dynamic import and URI functions could be misused if given malicious input, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above, standard utility code with minimal risk. No signs of malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for source detection, encoding, HTML detection, stream resetting, directory handling, URI requoting, dynamic import, options extraction, and value stringification.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; standard practices. The dynamic import_attribute and requote_uri could be misused if fed malicious data, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Safe utility functions; potential misuse exists but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for source detection, encoding, stream handling, URI processing, dynamic import, options extraction, and byte stream stats.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code; employs safe practices. Dynamic import_attribute could be exploited if given malicious input, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Standard utility code, no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar utility functions, with emphasis on data source detection, encoding, stream management, URI requoting, dynamic attribute import, and options extraction.\n- **Findings:** The dynamic import and `requote_uri` functions could be exploited if given malicious input, but no malicious code is present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The code is benign; potential risks are theoretical and depend on input validation.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature—utility functions with no malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, correct given the straightforward nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly above zero (0.2), mainly due to the potential misuse of dynamic imports and URI functions if provided with malicious input. However, these are standard utility functions and do not inherently pose a risk.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- The dynamic import and URI requoting functions, while standard, should be used with validated, trusted input to prevent potential exploitation.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack, malicious code, or malware is present.\n- The overall risk profile is very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final verdict:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.2** (consistent with the reports, considering potential misuse)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, well-structured, and typical of utility modules used in data processing pipelines.**",
