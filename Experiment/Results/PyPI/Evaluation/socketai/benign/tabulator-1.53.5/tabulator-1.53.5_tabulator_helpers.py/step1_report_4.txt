  "purpose": "Utility functions for data source detection, encoding detection, stream handling, URI processing, dynamic import, options extraction, and byte stream wrapping.",
  "sources": "Reads from source variables (strings, file-like objects), environment variables (via os), and external modules (imported modules like requests.utils).",
  "sinks": "Uses 'hashlib' for hashing data, 'os' for filesystem operations, and 'import_module' for dynamic imports; potential indirect influence on system or external modules.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sources such as strings or streams, through detection or normalization functions, into hashing or file operations; dynamic import functions could load arbitrary modules if given malicious input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code imports modules conditionally and uses dynamic import but within typical utility scope. URI requoting is based on external libraries; no evidence of malicious behavior. The BytesStatsWrapper updates hash and size info during read operations, which is standard for checksum validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions related to source detection, encoding, stream management, and import. It employs safe practices for stream resetting, directory creation, and encoding normalization. The dynamic import attribute function uses a fully qualified string but does not execute untrusted code directly. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are evident. The hashing wrapper class correctly updates hash and size stats during read operations. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected. The code appears to be well-structured utility code with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is standard utility code with no indications of malicious behavior or malware. It performs common tasks such as detection, normalization, and dynamic import safely within expected bounds. There is no evidence of supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. Overall security risk is very low.",
