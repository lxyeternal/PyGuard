  "purpose": "Utility functions for source detection, encoding detection, stream handling, URI processing, dynamic attribute import, options extraction, value stringification, and byte stream statistics tracking.",
  "sources": "Reading input streams, string sources, URL parsing, environment variables, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules, URL requoting, stream seeking, directory creation, and hash calculation.",
  "flows": "Source data (e.g., URL, stream, string) flows through detection functions, possibly into dynamic import or URL requoting functions, and stream reset or hash update methods.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code or obfuscation; potential misuse of dynamic import and URI functions if fed malicious input, but no actual malicious activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions used in data source detection, encoding detection, stream management, URI processing, dynamic module attribute import, options handling, value string conversion, and byte stream hashing. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import_attribute and requote_uri functions could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but within this code, they are used in a controlled manner. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature, with minor potential misuse considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions typical in data processing pipelines, with no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The potential misuse of dynamic import and URI functions warrants cautious input validation in production, but overall, the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use. The scores are justified and should remain as is.",
