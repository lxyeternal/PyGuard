{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration constants, supported formats, loader, parser, and writer mappings for a data processing application or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'VERSION' file to set the VERSION variable; otherwise, it mainly loads constants and mappings from hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present; no data is sent, received, or leaked in this code.",
  "flows": "The code sets static mappings and constants; no data flows from sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code constructs, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets beyond configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of defining constants, supported formats, and class path strings for loaders, parsers, and writers. The 'VERSION' is read from a local file, which is a standard practice for versioning. The mappings of string identifiers to class paths are typical in modular plugin systems. No user input, network operations, or data handling occurs here. No suspicious code, malicious payloads, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign configuration and mapping setup for a data processing library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply defines constants and class references for use elsewhere in the application.",
