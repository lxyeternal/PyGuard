  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a static configuration module, primarily defining constants, supported schemes, and mappings from string identifiers to class paths.\n- It reads a 'VERSION' file for versioning, which is a common practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs here.\n- The class path strings suggest a plugin architecture, but no actual dynamic loading is shown.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code appears to be straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-report review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** No issues, benign configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as Report 1, consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also consistent with previous reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) due to reading a version file, but this is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Reading a version file does not pose a security risk; it's standard. The score might be slightly overestimated, but it's not unreasonable.\n- **Verdict:** The score seems marginally high; a score of 0.0 or 0.05 might be more accurate, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores Estimation**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports agree on 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Given the code's static nature, no real security risk exists. The only point is reading a version file, which is benign. Therefore, **scores should be 0 or very close to 0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- The current scores are generally accurate, with the exception of Report 5's securityRisk being slightly high.\n- I would assign the following **final scores**:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0             |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risk:** Minimal, primarily due to reading a version file, which is standard practice.\n\n**Final verdict:** The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this, especially lowering the securityRisk in Report 5 to 0.",
