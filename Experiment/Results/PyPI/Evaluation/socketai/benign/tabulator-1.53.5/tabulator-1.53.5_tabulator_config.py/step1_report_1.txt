{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration constants, supported schemes, loaders, parsers, and writers for a data processing application or library.",
  "sources": "Reads VERSION file to determine version; no other external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output destinations are explicitly present; no untrusted data is written or sent over network.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code mainly sets static configuration variables and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code primarily loads configuration data and mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility and reads a version string from a file. It sets several constants for supported schemes, algorithms, and headers, which are typical for configuration modules. Loader, parser, and writer dictionaries map string identifiers to class paths, but no dynamic execution or untrusted data handling is present. No obfuscation or malicious logic is observed. The code appears to be a standard configuration setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward configuration module defining constants and mappings for data processing components. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and does not contain obfuscation or hidden malicious intent.",
