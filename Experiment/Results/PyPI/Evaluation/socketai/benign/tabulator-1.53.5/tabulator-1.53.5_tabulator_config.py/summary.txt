  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal risk score (around 0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by the benign file read but can be considered effectively zero. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose."
