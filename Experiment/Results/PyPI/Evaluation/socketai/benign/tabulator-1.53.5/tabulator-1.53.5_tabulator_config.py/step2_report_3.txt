  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall conclusion.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a configuration module defining constants, supported schemes, and mappings for loaders, parsers, and writers.\n- It reads a 'VERSION' file for version info.\n- It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network operations, or data processing logic.\n- Class references are stored as strings for dynamic loading, which is a common pattern.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard setup/configuration component of a larger data processing library.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Configuration constants, mappings.\n- Source: Reads VERSION file, no other external input.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static configuration, no data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard configuration, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Source: Reads VERSION file; no other external data.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static mappings.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard plugin setup, no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Benign configuration.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Configuration constants, mappings.\n- Source: Reads VERSION file.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical static configuration, no suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Source: Reads VERSION file.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard configuration, no malicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Configuration/constants.\n- Source: Reads VERSION file.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Only reading from filesystem.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical configuration; no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) perhaps due to reading from the filesystem, but still benign. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is appropriate given the code is purely configuration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All agree on 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** All are very low, mostly 0, with the last at 0.1, which is reasonable given the code only reads a version file.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The only minor point is the small security risk (0.1) in the last report, justified by reading from the filesystem, but this is benign in context.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code or payload.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.05** — very minimal, mainly due to filesystem read, but entirely benign.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the low security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are well-reasoned and accurate; I concur with their assessments.",
