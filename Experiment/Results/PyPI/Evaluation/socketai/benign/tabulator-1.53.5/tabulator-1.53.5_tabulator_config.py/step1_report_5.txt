{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a configuration or setup module for a data processing library, defining constants, supported schemes, and class paths for loaders, parsers, and writers.",
  "sources": "Reads the VERSION file from the filesystem to determine version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads VERSION from the filesystem; no other data flows to external systems or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code segments detected. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Usage of class paths as strings is typical for dynamic loading but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets constants and mappings for file handling, compression, hashing, HTTP headers, and parsers/loaders/writers. It reads a version string from a local file without processing sensitive data. The loader, parser, and writer mappings use string references to class paths, which is a common pattern for dynamic import and plugin systems. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is apparent. There are no signs of sabotage or malware, and the structure is straightforward. It is purely configuration with no runtime logic that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for a data processing package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable activity is reading a version file, which is benign.",
