{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration constants, supported formats, and mappings for loaders, parsers, and writers in a data processing library.",
  "sources": "File reading for VERSION; environment variables or configuration files are not explicitly read or used in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident in this code; no output, network, or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets constants and configuration mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The usage of string paths and format lists is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, reads a version string from a file, and defines various configuration constants for supported schemes, compression algorithms, hash functions, headers, and file parsers/writers. It also sets up mappings from identifiers to class paths, which are typical in plugin-based architectures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code is purely declarative, defining static configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration/setup snippet for a data processing library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited. Therefore, it appears safe.",
