{
  "purpose": "This code defines static configuration constants, supported schemes, class path mappings for loaders, parsers, and writers, and reads a version string from a file. It serves as a setup module for a larger data processing framework.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'VERSION' file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of constants and mappings; no data flow or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining constants, supported schemes, and class path strings for dynamic loading. It reads a version string from a file, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network communications, or suspicious patterns. The class path strings suggest plugin architecture but are not executed here. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal risk score (around 0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by the benign file read but can be considered effectively zero. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
