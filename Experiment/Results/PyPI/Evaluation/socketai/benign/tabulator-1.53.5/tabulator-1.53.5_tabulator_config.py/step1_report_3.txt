{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants, supported schemes, and mappings for loaders, parsers, and writers in a data processing library.",
  "sources": "File reading for the VERSION file, environment variables, and hardcoded constants within the code.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or untrusted data handling points are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks are evident in the static code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be straightforward configuration and setup for a data processing package.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets constants, configuration options, and mappings for loaders, parsers, and writers. There is an environment variable read for VERSION. No user input handling, network communication, or code execution based on untrusted input is present. The usage of string literals, file reads, and static lists does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clean, well-structured, and typical for configuration modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a configuration setup for a data processing library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It reads a version file and defines constants and mappings. There are no suspicious data flows or anomalous code behaviors.",
