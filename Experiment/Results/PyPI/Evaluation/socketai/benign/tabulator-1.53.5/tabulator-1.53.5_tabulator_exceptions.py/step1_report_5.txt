  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a module related to file and data handling, including deprecated aliases.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the code; it only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution flows involving untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions without any suspicious or unusual code structures. Usage of __future__ imports is for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides exception class definitions for handling various errors related to file parsing, scheme, format, encoding, compression, and loading errors. It includes deprecated aliases for some exception classes. There are no input or output operations, network calls, or data processing logic. The code is well-structured, conventional, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of exception class definitions intended for a larger application. It poses no security risks, does not contain malware, and shows no signs of malicious intent.",
