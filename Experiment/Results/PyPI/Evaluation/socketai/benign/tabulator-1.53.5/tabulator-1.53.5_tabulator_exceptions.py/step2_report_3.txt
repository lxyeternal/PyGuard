  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code only defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - It uses `__future__` imports for compatibility.\n   - No input/output operations, network calls, dynamic code execution, or data processing are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The code includes some deprecated aliases, which is common in evolving codebases.\n\n2. **Security Implications:**\n   - Since this code solely establishes exception classes, it cannot directly introduce security vulnerabilities.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n   - The lack of data flow, sinks, or sources means there's no attack surface here.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward and readable.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified; the code does not pose any security risk or supply chain threat.\n\n4. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural and error handling related.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are supported by the code content.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.\n   - The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are appropriate and should remain at 0.\n   - The code is benign, standard, and unlikely to impact supply chain security.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- I agree with the current assessments.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe and does not contribute to any security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and does not introduce security concerns.",
