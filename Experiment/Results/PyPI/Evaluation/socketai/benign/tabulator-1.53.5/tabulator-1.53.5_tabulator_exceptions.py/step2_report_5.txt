  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to file handling errors.\n- No input/output, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data processing occurs.\n- The code uses `__future__` imports for compatibility, which is standard practice.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with some deprecated aliases.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No evidence suggests malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk:**\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- Since the code is purely structural, defining exception classes, there is no reason to adjust these scores.\n\n**Potential for Misinterpretation:**\n- No claims in the reports are based on assumptions; they all correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code snippet is a typical, harmless part of a larger project, serving as error handling scaffolding. It does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
