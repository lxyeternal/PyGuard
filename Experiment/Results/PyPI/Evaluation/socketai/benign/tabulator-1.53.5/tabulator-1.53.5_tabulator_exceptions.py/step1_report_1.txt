{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to file parsing, scheme, format, encoding, and compression in a tabulator module.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted data sources are read; the code primarily defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code only establishes exception class hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception class. It uses future imports for compatibility and defines a structured hierarchy of custom exceptions related to file handling errors. No input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in a larger application. It shows no malicious behavior or security risks.",
