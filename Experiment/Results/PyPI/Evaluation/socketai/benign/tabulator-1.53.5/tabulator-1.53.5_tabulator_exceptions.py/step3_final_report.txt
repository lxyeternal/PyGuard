{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling related to file parsing, encoding, compression, and loading errors in a Python module.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only declares class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code consists solely of class declarations without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with some deprecated aliases, standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, with no input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It uses __future__ imports for compatibility. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The classes serve as error types for a larger application. The code is purely structural and does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It poses no threat to supply chain security and is typical of error handling scaffolding in Python projects.",
