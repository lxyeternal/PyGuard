  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a module related to file handling, parsing, and error management.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data inputs; the code only defines classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definitions do not involve runtime data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, including some deprecated aliases. There are no data inputs, outputs, or execution logic. The imports are standard future statements for compatibility. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, non-malicious set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The code is purely structural and does not contain any malicious behavior.",
