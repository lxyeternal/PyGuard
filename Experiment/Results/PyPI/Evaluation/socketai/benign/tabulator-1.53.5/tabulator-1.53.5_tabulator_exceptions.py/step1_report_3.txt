  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a tabulator module to handle various errors related to file parsing, encoding, compression, and loading issues.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output generation present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility and defines multiple custom exception classes, including some deprecated aliases. It is purely structural, serving as error handling scaffolding without any logic that could be malicious. No data input, network communication, or system manipulation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for error handling in a module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and unrelated to supply chain security threats.",
