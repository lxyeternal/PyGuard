  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Each Report:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions for error handling related to file parsing, encoding, compression, and loading errors.\n- They consistently note the absence of input/output operations, network activity, data flows, or any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly assign a confidence of 1, with no obfuscation, malware, or security risks detected.\n- The code is considered benign, structural, and part of a larger application framework.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the descriptions: it's purely class definitions for exceptions, with no dynamic or malicious code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign and non-malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None. All scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since there's no evidence of malicious behavior, the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code as non-malicious.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Code Content:**  \nPurely class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\nGiven the comprehensive analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is benign, and no security concerns are evident.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
