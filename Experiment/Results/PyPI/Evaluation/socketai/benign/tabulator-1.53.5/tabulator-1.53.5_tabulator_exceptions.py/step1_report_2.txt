  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a module related to file parsing, encoding, compression, and loading errors.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data dynamically; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs are used or affected.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external input or untrusted sources, as this code only establishes class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exception handling, with no input/output operations, external data access, or dynamic execution. It uses standard Python practices and imports for compatibility, but no risky behaviors or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for exception classes with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger project that handles various error conditions. No indicators of malware or security threats are present.",
