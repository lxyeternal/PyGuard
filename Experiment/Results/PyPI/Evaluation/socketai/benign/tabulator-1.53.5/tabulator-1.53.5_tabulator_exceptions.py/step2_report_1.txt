  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - The code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception.\n   - It includes some deprecated aliases for backward compatibility.\n   - It uses `__future__` imports for compatibility across Python versions.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as an error handling framework.\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n   - No external data sources or sinks that could be exploited.\n   - The exception classes are standard practice in Python for error handling.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-risk behaviors.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1.0), and all indicate zero malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The analysis in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes, the potential attack surface is negligible.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is benign and poses no security threat in the supply chain context.",
