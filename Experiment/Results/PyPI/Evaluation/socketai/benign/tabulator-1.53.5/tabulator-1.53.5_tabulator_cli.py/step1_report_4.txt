{
  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface for data extraction and display from various sources (e.g., files, databases) with customizable options.",
  "sources": "Input source specified by the 'source' argument, options provided via command-line parameters, and environment if applicable.",
  "sinks": "Data output to the console using click.echo; potential data leakage if sensitive data is printed unintentionally.",
  "flows": "Source (input data) is processed through tabulator.Stream, headers are read and printed, rows are iterated and printed line-by-line.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard libraries and no malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CLI command using click to read data from a source via tabulator.Stream. It normalizes options, handles exceptions, and outputs data to the console. No external network calls, no data exfiltration mechanisms, no suspicious code patterns. The code primarily focuses on data display with user-provided parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility for data reading and display. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
