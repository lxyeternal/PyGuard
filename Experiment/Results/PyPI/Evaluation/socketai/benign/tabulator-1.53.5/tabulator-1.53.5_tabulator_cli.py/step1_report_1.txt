{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for reading and displaying tabular data from various sources (e.g., files, databases, APIs) using the tabulator library.",
  "sources": "The 'source' argument, options such as '--sheet', '--resource', '--property', and stream headers, which are used as inputs for data sources and configurations.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'click.echo' to output data, which is standard; no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident. The only data output is data read from sources.",
  "flows": "Source (input data or configuration options) flows into the 'tabulator.Stream' object, which reads data from the source; then data is output via 'click.echo'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code handles data processing and output normally. Exception handling only logs errors and exits.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries and functions to process input data. The code normalizes options, attempts to convert certain options to integers, then opens a data stream. It outputs headers and rows, respecting a limit if specified. Error handling is straightforward. No suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or security flaws are evident. The code does not execute untrusted code, nor does it contain hidden network activities or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI utility for data processing, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It securely handles inputs and outputs, with proper exception handling. No signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks are observed.",
