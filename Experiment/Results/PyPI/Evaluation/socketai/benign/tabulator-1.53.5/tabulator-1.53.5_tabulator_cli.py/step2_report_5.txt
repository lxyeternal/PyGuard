  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a CLI utility that reads data from various sources using the `tabulator` library and outputs it via `click.echo`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The data output is from untrusted sources, but the code handles this in a straightforward manner.\n- Exception handling is standard.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The potential for data leakage exists if sensitive data is printed, but this is typical for such tools.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code appears correct and functional.\n- No security vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious logic are present.\n- The normalization of options and exception handling are standard practices.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning states no malicious or suspicious behavior. The low risk score (0.1) is appropriate, considering minimal risk of data leakage or misuse.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Similar reasoning, consistent with the previous. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to potential data leakage if sensitive data is printed. This is a normal concern for CLI tools displaying untrusted data.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning as above; no malicious activity, just standard data display.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others; potential for data leakage but no malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score analysis:\n- All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Risk score:\n- The scores range from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low but present potential for data leakage.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity, these scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2, consistent with the potential for data leakage in CLI tools handling untrusted data.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since data leakage potential exists but no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports' assessments are accurate.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No modifications or corrections are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, safe CLI utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low risk score appropriately reflects the minimal security concern.",
