  "purpose": "A command-line utility to read and display tabular data from various sources using the tabulator library.",
  "sources": "Input source specified by the 'source' argument, options such as 'sheet' and 'resource' which are cast to integers.",
  "sinks": "Output via click.echo to stdout, displaying headers and rows from the data stream.",
  "flows": "Data read from tabulator.Stream (source) flows to stdout through click.echo, with headers and rows printed sequentially.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that reads data from various sources and outputs it. It normalizes options, handles exceptions, and outputs data. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data output could leak sensitive info if data is confidential, but this is inherent to such tools. The code's simplicity and proper exception handling indicate low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data display CLI utility with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
