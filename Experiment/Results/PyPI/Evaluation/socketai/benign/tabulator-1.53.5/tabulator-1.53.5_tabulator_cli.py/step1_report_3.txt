{
  "purpose": "The code implements a command-line interface for a data tabulation tool, allowing users to load data from various sources with multiple configurable options.",
  "sources": "Input source specified by the 'source' argument; options provided via command-line arguments and environment variables (implied through options).",
  "sinks": "Data outputs via 'click.echo'; potential data leakage if sensitive data is printed, but no untrusted data is directly written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'source' flows through 'tabulator.Stream', which reads data; data is then processed and printed to the console via 'click.echo'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a CLI for data extraction and display, primarily using the 'tabulator' library. It processes user inputs securely, with proper exception handling. No sensitive data handling or insecure patterns observed. It does not include external network calls, file modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of 'click' for CLI and 'tabulator' for data handling are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. There is a potential for data leakage if sensitive data is printed, but this is a normal feature of CLI tools. No signs of malware, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI data processing script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe for use from a supply chain perspective.",
