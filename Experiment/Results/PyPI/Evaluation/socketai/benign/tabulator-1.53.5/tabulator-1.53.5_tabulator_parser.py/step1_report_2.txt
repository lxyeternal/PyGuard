{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract parser class for data file support, meant to be inherited by specific parser implementations.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains class definitions and import statements only.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "None; as there are no operational data flows or execution paths with untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard abstract class definition with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, uses six for Python 2/3 compatibility, and defines an abstract class with placeholder methods for a parser interface. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or input handling within this code snippet. The class methods are unimplemented, serving as an API contract, and do not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard abstract class definition serving as an interface for data parsers. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger data processing library.",
