{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for data parsers, specifying required methods and properties for subclasses that handle file reading and parsing.",
  "sources": "No specific data sources are read directly in this code; it primarily defines an interface for subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code; it sets up method signatures without actual implementation.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are implemented here; this code is purely structural with abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard imports and class definitions for an API interface.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility and six for cross-version support, then defines an abstract class with several abstract methods and properties that subclasses must implement. There are no executable or data-processing components; it serves as a template for parsers. The code does not perform any I/O, data handling, or network operations. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are detected. Since it is an abstract interface, it cannot be exploited or malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a structural interface for parser implementations and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include executable code that could be exploited or malicious. Its purpose is to define method signatures and properties for subclasses, with no evident security concerns.",
