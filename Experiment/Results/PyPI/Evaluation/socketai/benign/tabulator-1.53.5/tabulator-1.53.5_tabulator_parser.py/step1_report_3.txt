{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Parser' for data parsers that support reading, resetting, and closing file sources with extended row iteration.",
  "sources": "Loader instance passed to the constructor; source argument in 'open' method",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; methods do not process untrusted data directly",
  "flows": "Input source path and options flow into 'open' method; external file streams are managed internally; extended_rows provides an iterator over parsed rows",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. Use of six and abc for compatibility is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is an abstract class defining an interface for data parsers, including properties and methods for opening, closing, resetting, and retrieving extended rows. There is no implementation or logic that could be malicious. No suspicious imports or code patterns are present. The code does not include any network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. It appears to be a straightforward interface definition for a data parsing framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard interface for parsers without any malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, suspicious code, or security risks within this fragment.",
