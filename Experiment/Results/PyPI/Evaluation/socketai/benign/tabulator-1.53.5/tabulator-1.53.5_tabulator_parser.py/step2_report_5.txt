  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a pure abstract class defining an interface for data parsers.\n   - No executable logic, data processing, or data sources are present.\n   - Uses standard imports (`six`, `abc`, `__future__`) for compatibility.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious or security issues. This aligns with the code's nature as an interface definition.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the assessments are consistent and thorough.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as a standard, safe API interface.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable. The code does not perform any operations that could pose a security risk.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that since this is an abstract class with no implementation, it cannot be malicious. This is correct.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or exploits based on this code snippet, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The reasoning is sound; the code is a boilerplate interface with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard abstract class serving as an interface for parsers. It contains no executable logic, no data handling, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. The uniform reports correctly identify it as benign and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are no security issues, malware, or obfuscation present in this code snippet. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
