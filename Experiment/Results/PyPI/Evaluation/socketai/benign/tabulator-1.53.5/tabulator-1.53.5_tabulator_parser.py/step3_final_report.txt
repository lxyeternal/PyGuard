{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract class for data parsers, serving as an interface for subclasses to implement specific parsing logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only declares method signatures and properties for subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; as an interface, it does not process data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard imports and abstract methods.",
  "analysis": "The code is a pure abstract base class defining an interface for parsers, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. It uses standard compatibility imports and abc for abstract methods. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The class attributes and methods are correctly defined for subclass implementation. Given its nature as an interface, it cannot perform malicious actions or pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API interface with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
