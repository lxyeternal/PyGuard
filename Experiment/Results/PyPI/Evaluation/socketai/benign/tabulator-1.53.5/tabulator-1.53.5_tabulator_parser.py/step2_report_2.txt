  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines an abstract class for data parsers.\n- **Analysis:** No data sources or sinks, purely interface with abstract methods.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Score Justification:** The code is a standard abstract class, with no executable logic or data handling, so malware and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining an abstract parser class.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no data processing, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Score Justification:** The class is a template, no malicious activity possible; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Again, an interface for data parsers.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow, no code execution, no suspicious imports or behaviors.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Score Justification:** As with previous reports, this is a benign abstract class.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar parser interface.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime data handling, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Score Justification:** No malware or security concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code, no data processing, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Score Justification:** Appropriate to assign zero scores.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify this code as a benign interface with no malicious behavior. The malware score should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely an interface with no executable or data handling logic, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores given in all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign abstract class serving as an interface for parser implementations, with no security concerns.",
