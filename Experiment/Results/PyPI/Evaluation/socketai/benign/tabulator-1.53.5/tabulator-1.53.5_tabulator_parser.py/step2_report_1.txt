  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is an abstract class defining a parser interface, with no data processing, no I/O, and no malicious behavior.\n- They note the use of future imports, six library, and abc module, which are standard for compatibility.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is purely structural, serving as a template for subclasses.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain executable logic or data handling, only method signatures.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or security risks are evident.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The code appears correct for its purpose as an interface. No errors or flaws are apparent.\n- The only minor point is that the `options` attribute is initialized as an empty list at the class level, which might be intended as a class attribute but could be more appropriately an instance attribute; however, this is not a security concern.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the code is purely an interface with no executable or risky behavior.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. They align with the analysis that this code is benign, structural, and non-executable.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No higher scores are justified because there's no malicious, obfuscated, or risky code present.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they recognize the code as an interface template.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet, as an abstract interface, does not pose any security threat or contain malicious content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard abstract class for data parsers, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
