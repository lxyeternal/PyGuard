{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Parser' for data parsing implementations, outlining the structure and required methods for file parsing support.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data directly; it defines class structure and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, since this is purely class interface definition without executable data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard Python features, including future imports, six library for compatibility, and abc module for abstract classes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class definition used as a template for subclasses implementing specific parsers. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present. The use of future imports and six library indicates compatibility handling, not malicious obfuscation. The code is structurally sound and typical for an API interface in a package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, structural code defining an abstract parser class for data files. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be safe and intended for extension by other modules.",
