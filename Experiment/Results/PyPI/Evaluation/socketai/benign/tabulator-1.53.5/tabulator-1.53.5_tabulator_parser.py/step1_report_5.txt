  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data parsers used in a file processing module.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code does not read input or data directly. It defines an interface for subclasses that will handle data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the class itself does not process untrusted data directly but provides methods to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows within this code snippet since it's purely an interface definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard abstract class with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. Usage of 'six' for compatibility and 'abc' for abstract classes is common and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract class 'Parser' with methods to be implemented by subclasses for handling file streams. It uses standard Python features, including the 'six' library for compatibility and abstract base classes. There are no dynamic code evaluations, no network calls, no embedded secrets or credentials, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be a boilerplate interface intended for extension, with no malicious behavior. It does not perform any operations on untrusted data or system resources.\n\nNo signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard interface definition for data parsers with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
