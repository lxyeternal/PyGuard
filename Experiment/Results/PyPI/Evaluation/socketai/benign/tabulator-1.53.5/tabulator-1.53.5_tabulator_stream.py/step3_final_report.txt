{
  "purpose": "A data streaming and parsing framework that handles sources like files, URLs, compressed files, with header detection, filtering, sampling, and saving capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads from file paths, URLs, streams, compressed archives, and HTML pages.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via user-defined writers, saving to local files or streams.",
  "flows": "Source (file/URL/stream) -> loader -> parser -> processors (filtering, sampling, transformations) -> output (save or iterate).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code patterns. Use of dynamic module loading via external helpers could be exploited if malicious modules are supplied, but this is standard plugin architecture.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, flexible data processing library supporting multiple formats, compression types, and customizable loaders, parsers, and writers. It performs header detection, filtering, sampling, and data output. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation patterns are present. The reliance on external modules via dynamic import functions is a known pattern in plugin systems but could be exploited if external components are malicious. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic. The sampling and header detection mechanisms are standard, and no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure, and well-designed data processing framework with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external modules loaded dynamically, which is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low, approximately 0.2, reflecting the typical risks associated with plugin architectures.",
