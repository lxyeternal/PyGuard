  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure, and well-designed data processing framework with no malicious intent. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external modules loaded dynamically, which is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low, approximately 0.2, reflecting the typical risks associated with plugin architectures."
