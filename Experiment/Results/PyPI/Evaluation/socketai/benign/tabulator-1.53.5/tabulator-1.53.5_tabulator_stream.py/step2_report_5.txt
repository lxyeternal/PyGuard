  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a data streaming and parsing framework, handling sources, headers, filtering, and saving. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected. The main concern is potential misuse via custom loaders/parsers/writers, which is outside the code scope.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low).  \n  **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate given the potential for external component misuse.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dynamic module loading, format detection, and filtering. No malicious activity observed. The main concern is the use of dynamic imports, which could be risky if configured maliciously.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent. No malware or obfuscation present. The low risk score is reasonable, considering the external dependencies could be malicious if misused, but not within this code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's support for various sources, formats, and filtering. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or network activity. The dynamic import pattern is standard but warrants caution.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  **Justification:** Correctly identifies the code as benign. The risk score is appropriate given the extensibility and potential for external malicious components, but no direct malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the code's comprehensive data handling capabilities, no malicious activity, and standard design patterns. No signs of malware or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  **Justification:** The assessment is accurate. The low risk score reflects the safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar overall conclusion: a flexible, safe data ingestion module with no signs of malicious behavior. No malware, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  **Justification:** The reasoning is consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0. No evidence of malicious code, network activity, or sabotage.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All agree on 0. No obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting potential risks if external components are malicious, but no issues within the code itself.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning across all reports and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable given the code's nature. No changes needed.",
