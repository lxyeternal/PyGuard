{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a Python module by importing future features, defining a version, and importing various submodules and exceptions for a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, local module imports (.cli, .stream, .loader, etc.), and configuration import (config).",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data are present; no network, file, or system command executions are evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily establishes module structure and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard boilerplate for a Python package; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of import statements and a version assignment. It employs __future__ imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, or input/output handling present. All imported modules seem to be part of the package’s structure, and no external or suspicious code is referenced. The structure indicates typical package initialization, with deprecated imports possibly for backward compatibility. No anomalies or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports modules and defines a version, with no dangerous operations detected.",
