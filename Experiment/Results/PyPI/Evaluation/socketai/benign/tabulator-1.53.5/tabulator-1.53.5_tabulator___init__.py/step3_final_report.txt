{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing various components and setting the version based on configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version assignment from config",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Importing modules and setting version without dynamic execution or data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard boilerplate code, deprecated exception imports are benign",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of import statements, version setting, and API exposure. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing occurs. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The minimal security risk arises from its nature as boilerplate setup code, which inherently carries negligible risk. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect zero malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of 0 due to the lack of any operational threat.",
