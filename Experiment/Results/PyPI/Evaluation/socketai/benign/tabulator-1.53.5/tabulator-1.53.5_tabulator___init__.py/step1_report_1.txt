{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports and configuration for a Python package, including versioning, API components, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules such as config, cli, stream, loader, parser, writer, validate, and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules (like config) to exported variables (like __version__) and from imported components (like cli, Stream, Loader, etc.) to the package's API.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily manages imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version setting, and exporting key components of a package API. It does not execute any runtime logic, network operations, or dynamic code evaluation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is apparent in this fragment. The presence of deprecated exception imports may warrant further review of related modules, but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for a Python package, primarily handling imports and exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this fragment.",
