{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data loaders, intended to support different data source schemes.",
  "sources": "Input sources are specified via the 'load' method parameter 'source' (a string path).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no data is written or sent out.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'source' parameter in 'load' to the implementation in subclasses; no direct data flow is visible in this abstract class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward abstract class with no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class using standard Python practices, with no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network operations. It imports compatibility features and a metaclass utility but does not perform any I/O, network access, or data manipulation within the class itself. No potential attack vectors or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious abstract class definition for data loaders. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior and does not introduce security risks.",
