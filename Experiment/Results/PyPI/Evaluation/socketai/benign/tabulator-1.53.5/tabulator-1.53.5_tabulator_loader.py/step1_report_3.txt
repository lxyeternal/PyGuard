{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data loaders supporting various schemes.",
  "sources": "Constructor (__init__) and load() method arguments (source, mode, encoding).",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling evident in the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (source, mode, encoding) flow into load() method, but the implementation is abstract.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ imports and six for compatibility, but no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Loader' with an initializer and an abstract load() method. There are no implementations that process data, no hardcoded secrets, and no network or file operations shown. It is a standard pattern for extensibility, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign abstract class defining an interface for data loaders. No malicious or security risks are present.",
