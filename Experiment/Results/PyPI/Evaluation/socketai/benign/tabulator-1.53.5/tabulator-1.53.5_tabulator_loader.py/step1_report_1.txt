{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data loaders to support various data source schemes (e.g., ssh).",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, six, and abc modules; class constructor and abstract load method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or output present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the class only defines structure without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports compatibility modules, defines an abstract class 'Loader' with an options attribute, constructor, and an abstract load method. No data is processed, no network or file operations are performed within this code fragment. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a framework for data loaders without any malicious intent or security risks. It merely establishes an interface for subclasses to implement loading mechanisms. No malware, suspicious activity, or security issues are detected.",
