  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class 'Loader' for data source implementations, serving as an interface for subclasses.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'source', 'mode', and 'encoding' in the 'load' method; class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in subclasses' implementations of 'load' where 'source' may be used insecurely, but not in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows depend on subclass implementations; this code only defines the interface, not actual data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard imports and an abstract class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard abstract class for data loaders, with no data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. It uses common compatibility imports and defines an interface for subclasses. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, and it does not perform any runtime actions. The security and malware assessments are consistent across reports, all indicating no malicious activity or security risks. Potential vulnerabilities depend on subclass implementations, but these are outside the scope of this fragment. Overall, the code is benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence level of 1.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class serving as an interface for data loaders. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
