{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for data loaders that support different data schemes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the __init__ method and the load method (source, mode, encoding).",
  "sinks": "None apparent in the provided code; no untrusted data is being processed directly into vulnerable operations.",
  "flows": "The load method takes a source, mode, and encoding as input but contains no implementation, so no data flow occurs within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code contains standard use of future imports, six library, and abc module for abstract classes, with no suspicious code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract class 'Loader' meant to be extended for specific data source loaders. It employs common Python practices for compatibility and abstraction. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network operations, and no data leaks. The code is straightforward and appears to be a typical boilerplate for a plugin interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract class definition with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It serves as an interface template for data loaders without performing any operations itself.",
