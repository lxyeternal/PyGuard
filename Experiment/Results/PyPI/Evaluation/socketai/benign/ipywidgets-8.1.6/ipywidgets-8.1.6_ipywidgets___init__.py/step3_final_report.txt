  "purpose": "Setup and registration of communication channels for Jupyter widgets within the IPython environment.",
  "sources": "Version info imports, environment detection via get_ipython(), and widget module imports.",
  "sinks": "Registration functions that set up communication targets with the Jupyter kernel.",
  "flows": "Initialization functions check for IPython environment and register communication targets if present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Jupyter widgets, involving environment detection, version handling, and communication registration. It imports known libraries and defines functions to register communication channels with the kernel, executing automatically if in a Jupyter environment. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical widget setup procedures. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for Jupyter widgets with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1—are justified and appropriate given the code's nature.",
