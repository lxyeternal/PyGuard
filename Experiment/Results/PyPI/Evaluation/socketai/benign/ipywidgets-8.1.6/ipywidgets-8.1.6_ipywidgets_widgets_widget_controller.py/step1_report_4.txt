  "purpose": "Define widget classes for gamepad or joystick controllers in a Jupyter Notebook extension.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.valuewidget, .widget, .domwidget, .widget_core, .trait_types) and traitlets; class attribute definitions; class registration decorators.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations. The code primarily defines classes and properties.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative class definitions with no dynamic execution or input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual patterns observed. Usage of traitlets for property definitions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines widget classes for gamepad controllers, including Button, Axis, and Controller, with their associated properties and registration. All properties are defined with static types and default values. There are no dynamic data handling, input processing, or external data fetching. The imports are from local modules and standard traitlets library, with no indication of malicious code or behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward declaration of widget classes for game controller representation in a Jupyter environment. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and appears safe. No security risks or malware indications detected.",
