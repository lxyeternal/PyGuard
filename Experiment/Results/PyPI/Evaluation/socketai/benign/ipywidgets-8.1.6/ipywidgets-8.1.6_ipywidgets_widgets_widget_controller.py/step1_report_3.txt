  "purpose": "Define classes for gamepad or joystick controller widgets used in a Jupyter environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from local package and traitlets for widget traits.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating potential malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears standard for widget class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines widget classes for a game controller interface, utilizing standard traitlets and widget registration functions. No external input handling, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on well-established libraries and patterns, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected. The code is straightforward and serves as a UI representation for game controllers, with no apparent security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard widget class definitions for representing gamepad controls, with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
