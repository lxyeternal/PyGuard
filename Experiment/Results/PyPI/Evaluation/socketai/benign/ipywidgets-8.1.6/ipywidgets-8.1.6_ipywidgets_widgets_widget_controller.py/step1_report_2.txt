  "purpose": "Define widget classes for representing gamepad or joystick controllers in a Jupyter notebook environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (.valuewidget, .widget, .domwidget, .widget_core, .trait_types, traitlets) and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow pathways; the code mainly defines classes and attributes with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions that utilize standard widget frameworks for Jupyter, with no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or sensitive data handling. The import statements are typical for such widget classes. All attributes are set up with type annotations and help descriptions, adhering to standard practices. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of widget classes for game controller representation, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
