  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for a Python package that imports setuptools and calls setup() when executed directly.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input or data; it only imports setuptools and executes setup() if run as main.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sources are used; setup() is called with no arguments, performing no harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: import setuptools -> if __name__ == '__main__': call setup() with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, minimal setup script for Python packaging. It contains no dynamic or malicious behavior, no data processing, and no network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and adherence to common practice justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python setup file with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
