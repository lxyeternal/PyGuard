  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distribution of a Python project (likely IPython/Jupyter related).",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'setuptools' and execution of setup() in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() could potentially be a sink if malicious code was injected, but here it is a standard packaging call.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'setuptools' as source, then runs setup() if executed directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a minimal and standard setup script with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() if run as the main program. No external inputs, environment variables, or malicious code present. The comments indicate copyright information. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected. The code is minimal, typical of Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
