  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call, which is invoked if the script is executed directly.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which could process package metadata; no untrusted data handling evident.",
  "flows": "The script executes setup() when run directly; no data flow from external sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no unusual behavior. The script is minimal and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script that imports setuptools and calls setup() if run as the main module. It lacks any input handling, environment variable usage, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply invokes setuptools to manage package installation.",
