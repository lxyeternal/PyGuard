{
  "purpose": "Defines a ValueWidget class for interactive input in Jupyter notebooks, inheriting from Widget.",
  "sources": "Imports from .widget and traitlets, and the class itself where 'value' is assigned and returned.",
  "sinks": "Return of self.value in get_interact_value() method.",
  "flows": "The value stored in self.value is returned directly for use in interactive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code is straightforward and typical of widget definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class inheriting from Widget, and declares an 'Any' trait for 'value' with a help description. The get_interact_value method simply returns this value, which is standard for widget data retrieval. The _repr_keys method customizes the order of representation keys. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical widget class used for interactive purposes within Jupyter notebooks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard widget class definition for Jupyter, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
