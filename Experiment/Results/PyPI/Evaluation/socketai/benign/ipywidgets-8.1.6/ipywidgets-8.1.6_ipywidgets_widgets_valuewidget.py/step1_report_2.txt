{
  "purpose": "Define a widget class for interactive functions in a Jupyter environment, allowing for user input and value retrieval.",
  "sources": "Imports from .widget and traitlets; class attributes such as 'value'; methods 'get_interact_value' and '_repr_keys'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data assigned to 'value' property; 'get_interact_value' returns 'value' for use in other functions; '_repr_keys' provides representation keys.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors; code appears standard for a widget class with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a widget class with a 'value' property for user input, a method to retrieve that value, and a method for representation. It imports standard libraries, inherits from a base widget class, and overrides a representation method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leaks. The functionality is typical for UI widget components in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for user input handling within a Jupyter interface. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
