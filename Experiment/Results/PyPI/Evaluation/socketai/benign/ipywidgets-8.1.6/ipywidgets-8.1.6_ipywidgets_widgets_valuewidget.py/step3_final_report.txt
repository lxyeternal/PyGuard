  "purpose": "Defines a widget class for interactive input in Jupyter notebooks.",
  "sources": "The 'value' trait, accessed via 'self.value' in get_interact_value().",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'self.value' to 'get_interact_value()' and '_repr_keys()' methods internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Jupyter widget class with a 'value' trait and methods for retrieving and representing this value. It contains no malicious logic, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent. All signals point to a safe, well-structured widget class with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard widget class with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The slight variation in risk scores (0 or 0.1) can be adjusted to 0 for consistency, as there are no security concerns.",
