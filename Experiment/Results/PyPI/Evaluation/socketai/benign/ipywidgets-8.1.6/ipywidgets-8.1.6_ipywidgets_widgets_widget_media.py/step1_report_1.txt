  "purpose": "Define media widget classes for displaying images, audio, and video in a Jupyter environment, supporting file loading and URL input.",
  "sources": "Reading from filenames, file-like objects, and URLs (via string or bytes).",
  "sinks": "Assignment to self.value; potential data leaks if untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "Input sources (filenames, URLs, file-like objects) -> _load_file_value or URL encoding -> self.value; potential display/render in front-end.",
  "anomalies": "Use of raw file reading methods; no explicit security checks on file contents or URL validation; no encryption or credential handling; no suspicious or obfuscated code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines media widget classes for displaying images, audio, and video, with methods to load data from files or URLs. File reading uses standard open() calls, and URL strings are encoded as UTF-8 bytes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration code. The URL handling is basic, with no validation or sanitization, but that alone is not malicious. The code relies on standard Python modules (mimetypes, open) and does not include any network connections or data transmission beyond setting the value for front-end display. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of media widgets for Jupyter notebooks with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It primarily handles data input and presentation without performing any risky operations.",
