{
  "purpose": "Define media widget classes (Image, Video, Audio) for Jupyter notebooks, allowing display of media data via byte strings or URLs.",
  "sources": "Methods reading files (`_load_file_value`, `set_value_from_file`), URL input in `from_url` methods, `mimetypes.guess_type` for format detection.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to `self.value`, potential network URL handling in `from_url`, file reading operations, mimetype guessing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file or URL sources into `value`, which is then used for media display; file reading functions load data into `self.value`. URL input is converted to bytes and assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `mimetypes.guess_type` to infer file types; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; standard file and URL handling. No suspicious code paths or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for media widgets with functions to load media data from files or URLs, updating `value` attributes accordingly. The methods employ standard Python libraries (`mimetypes`, `open`) for file handling and type guessing. URL inputs are encoded as UTF-8 bytes and assigned directly, suitable for front-end display. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious code injections are present. The use of mimetypes is standard for format detection, and the overall structure aligns with typical widget definitions. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of media display widgets for Jupyter, with standard file and URL handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs typical data handling functions securely.",
