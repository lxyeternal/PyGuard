  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, correctness of logic, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code defines media widgets for images, audio, and video, with file and URL loading. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**:  \nThe code is straightforward, handling media data with standard Python libraries. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The slight security risk score (0.2) seems to reflect the potential for untrusted data to be displayed, but this is inherent in media display widgets.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on safe file handling and MIME type guessing. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:  \nAgain, standard code with no suspicious behavior. The low security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, focusing on safe data handling. No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:  \nNo issues found. The code is typical for media widgets.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Same general structure, with attention to safe handling. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**:  \nAppropriate given the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to others, standard media widget implementation with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Security risk**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**:  \nNo issues detected.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores** across all reports are 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores** are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores** are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting potential issues with untrusted data display but not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Systematic Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1-0.2 (standard for media display widgets handling untrusted data)\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion**, the provided scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of media widgets with no signs of malicious or obfuscated activity.",
