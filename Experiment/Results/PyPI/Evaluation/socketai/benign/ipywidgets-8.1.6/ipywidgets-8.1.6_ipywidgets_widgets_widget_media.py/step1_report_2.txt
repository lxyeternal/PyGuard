{
  "purpose": "Define media widget classes for display of images, videos, and audio in Jupyter notebooks, supporting file loading and URL input.",
  "sources": "Methods that load files (_load_file_value), URL inputs (from_url), and file path parameters in from_file and set_value_from_file.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to self.value, file reading operations, mimetypes.guess_type for format inference.",
  "flows": "File reading methods feed data into self.value; from_url encodes URL strings; _guess_format interprets file extension to MIME type.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code relies on standard libraries and typical widget class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for media widgets with standard file input, URL input, and MIME type guessing. File loading and URL encoding are typical, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The code handles input validation cautiously and uses safe file handling practices. No indicators of malicious intent, such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code's structure is straightforward, and no anomalous or suspicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of media widgets for Jupyter notebooks, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs common libraries and practices for handling media data, file input, and URL processing. Overall, it appears safe and intentionally designed for media display purposes.",
