{
  "purpose": "Defines media widget classes for images, videos, and audio in a Jupyter environment, allowing display and data loading from files or URLs.",
  "sources": "Input sources include file objects (via read method or filename string), and URLs (via from_url method).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks for untrusted data; it handles data display and file loading internally without network transmission or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file or URL sources into widget 'value' attributes, with optional format guessing based on filenames. No external or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard for media handling in Jupyter widgets.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes for media widgets, allowing loading media data from files or URLs, with format inference. The URL encoding process is straightforward and safe. File reading occurs with standard Python open, no user input sanitization issues. No network transmission or data exfiltration code is present. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. Overall, the code is typical for its purpose with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of media display widgets with safe handling of file and URL data sources. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module for media display in Jupyter notebooks.",
