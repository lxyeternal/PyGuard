{
  "purpose": "Defines media widget classes for displaying images, audio, and video in Jupyter notebooks, supporting loading from files and URLs.",
  "sources": "File reading methods (_load_file_value, set_value_from_file), URL encoding in from_url.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to self.value, MIME type guessing, URL encoding.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from files or URLs into self.value, with MIME type inference or URL encoding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity beyond setting display data.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and practices for handling media data, with straightforward file and URL processing. No dynamic code execution, network connections, or obfuscated patterns are present. URL inputs are encoded but not validated, which is typical for such widgets but not malicious. The code's purpose is purely to load and display media content, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of media display widgets for Jupyter, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the analysis and appropriate for this context.",
