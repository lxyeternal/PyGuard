  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Standard media widget classes with methods for loading from files and URLs. No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity beyond setting the value for display.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The logic is straightforward; no malicious behavior detected. The low risk score seems appropriate given the functionality.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on safe file handling and MIME type guessing. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign. The very low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard media widget classes with safe handling of file and URL inputs. No suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, with standard handling and no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar, standard media widget classes, safe data handling, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, benign implementation of media widgets for Jupyter notebooks.\n- **Malware Score:** All are zero, which is justified given no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's functionality—loading and displaying media data from files or URLs—these low scores are appropriate. The only minor concern could be unvalidated URL inputs, but that is typical and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is benign.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**, **0**, and around **0.1-0.2** respectively.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard handling, minimal attack surface)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' consensus and the code's straightforward nature.",
