  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code defines classes for media widgets in Jupyter: `_Media`, `Image`, `Video`, `Audio`.\n- Data loading is done via `_load_file_value`, `from_url`, and `set_value_from_file`.\n- No network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution beyond data handling.\n- Use of standard libraries (`mimetypes`, `open`) with no obfuscation.\n- URL inputs are encoded as UTF-8 bytes, which is standard.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard media widget classes.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, straightforward implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion that there's no malicious activity is correct. The low security risk (0.2) is justified given the potential for untrusted URLs or files, but no actual malicious code exists.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, safe use of standard libraries.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, no malicious behavior. The very low security risk score aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar media widget classes.\n- **Analysis:** Safe handling, no malicious code, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous findings. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar functionality.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, safe data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo concerns. The slightly higher security risk (0.2) is acceptable, considering potential untrusted URL input, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, standard handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code is purely for media display with no malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the potential for untrusted URL inputs, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious code are present.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly higher than zero due to untrusted URL handling, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's content and analysis.",
