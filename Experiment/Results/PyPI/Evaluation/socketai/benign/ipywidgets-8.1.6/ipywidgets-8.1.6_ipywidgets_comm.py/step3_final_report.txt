  "purpose": "Compatibility shim for ipykernel versions below 6.18, managing communication objects within IPython/Jupyter environments.",
  "sources": "sys.modules['ipykernel'], get_ipython(), comm, ipykernel.comm import Comm",
  "sinks": "get_ipython().kernel.comm_manager, comm.create_comm, Comm constructor",
  "flows": "Version check -> conditional import -> return comm_manager or create Comm object",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity; straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check on ipykernel, conditionally imports modules, and returns or creates communication objects. It uses standard IPython interfaces for compatibility. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is simple, readable, and adheres to typical patterns for environment compatibility. No external data or network activity is involved, and no secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim for IPython/IPykernel environments, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
