  "purpose": "Provide compatibility shim for ipykernel versions less than 6.18 in IPython environments.",
  "sources": "import sys, get_ipython() from IPython, comm module, ipykernel.version_info",
  "sinks": "get_ipython().kernel.comm_manager, comm.get_comm_manager(), comm.create_comm()",
  "flows": "Code checks for ipykernel version, retrieves comm manager or creates comm object based on environment conditions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, standard version check, conditional imports and function calls are typical for compatibility layers",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defining functions to check ipykernel version and select appropriate communication mechanisms. It performs a version check against ipykernel's version_info to determine compatibility, then retrieves or creates communication objects accordingly. The use of conditional imports and environment checks are typical for compatibility shims. No obfuscated code, no suspicious data handling, no external network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing solely on IPython kernel compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim for IPython/IPykernel versions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely within the IPython environment to manage communication objects without any data leaks or external connections.",
