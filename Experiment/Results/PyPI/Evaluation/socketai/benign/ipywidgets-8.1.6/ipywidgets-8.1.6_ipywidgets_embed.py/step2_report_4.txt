  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for generating embeddable HTML/JS for Jupyter widgets. No suspicious activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. Uses trusted CDNs. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard for widget embedding, with proper escaping and trusted URLs. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on safe serialization, escaping, and CDN URLs. No network or system calls, no malicious intent. Slightly lower confidence but still high.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The report notes that the URL is configurable but defaults to reputable CDNs, and the escaping is standard. The slight risk score reflects minimal concern about external URLs, which is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score of 0.1 is justified, given the reliance on external CDN URLs, but no malicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion—safe widget embedding, proper escaping, trusted CDN URLs, no malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is appropriate, considering external URL usage and safe data handling.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard widget embedding code, safe escaping, trusted CDNs, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with previous reports. The low risk score reflects the minimal security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar findings—safe serialization, trusted external URLs, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) perhaps due to the mention of external URLs, but still no malicious activity or obfuscation. The increase is marginal and acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code. The code is mainly about data serialization, escaping, and HTML generation.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slight variations, mostly 0.1 or 0.2, justified by external URL usage. No significant security risks are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (No malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (Code is clear, standard)\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** (Minor concerns about external URLs, but overall safe)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering external CDN URLs are trusted but still external dependencies)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects the reliance on external CDN URLs, which are reputable in this context.",
