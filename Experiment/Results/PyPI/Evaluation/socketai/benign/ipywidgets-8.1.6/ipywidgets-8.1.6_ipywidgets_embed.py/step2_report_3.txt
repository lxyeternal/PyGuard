  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the presence of issues, the correctness of reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** The report concludes that the code is legitimate, with no malicious behavior, and that it uses safe practices like escaping scripts and loading scripts from trusted CDNs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code's purpose is to generate embeddable widget HTML snippets, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The external URLs are from reputable CDNs, and the script escaping function is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on safe serialization, escaping, and CDN use. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) is justified given the dynamic URL construction and script embedding, but overall, the code remains safe. No malicious activity is identified.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** The report states the code is secure, with proper escaping, trusted CDN URLs, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The only minor concern is the dynamic URL assignment, but it defaults to trusted sources.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** The code is described as a benign utility for widget embedding, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code handles data securely, escapes scripts properly, and loads scripts from reputable CDNs.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary & Findings:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe practices and trusted external resources.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is acceptable considering the external URL flexibility, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Critical Review:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual issues or malicious behavior. The code is standard for widget embedding, with proper escaping and use of CDN resources.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reasoning in all reports is sound, consistent, and aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are zero, which is appropriate given the analysis. The obfuscated flag is correctly zero; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1-0.2) reflect minor concerns about dynamic URL handling but do not indicate real security risks.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that aren't supported by evidence. The escaping functions and trusted CDN URLs mitigate common risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to dynamic URL handling but overall low risk.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1-0.2** — Minor, justified by the use of external URLs and configuration options, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe implementation for embedding Jupyter widgets, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I agree with the provided reports' assessments and scores. They are consistent, justified, and reflect the code's benign nature.",
