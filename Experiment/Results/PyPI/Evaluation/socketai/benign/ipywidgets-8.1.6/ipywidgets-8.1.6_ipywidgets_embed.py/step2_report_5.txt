  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions for generating embeddable HTML/JS for Jupyter widgets. Sources include widget states, configurations, and external URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from widget instances into JSON, then into HTML snippets, with external scripts loaded from CDNs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. External URLs are from reputable CDNs. The code escapes scripts to prevent injection.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The analysis concludes the code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious behavior, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected) — justified.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.  \n- **Logic:** Fully consistent with the code's purpose and analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on widget embedding. Sources include widget states, URLs, and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Embeds JSON data into HTML snippets, escaping scripts, and loading scripts from CDNs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL usage, or obfuscation. Uses standard regex escaping.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report states no malicious activity, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still high.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the reliance on external CDN URLs, which are standard and safe.  \n- **Logic:** Sound, consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose; sources include widget states, view specs, and URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar data serialization and embedding approach, with escaping.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL usage, or obfuscation. Uses standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by external CDN reliance.\n- **Logic:** Fully aligned with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; sources include widget states, view specs, and external URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Embeds JSON data into HTML snippets, with safe escaping.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, standard escaping, CDN URLs from reputable sources.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, justified by safe URL choices.\n- **Logic:** Consistent and sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; sources include widget data, external script URLs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates HTML snippets, loads scripts from CDN.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, uses standard escaping.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still justified, considering reliance on CDN URLs.\n- **Logic:** Fully aligned with the code's intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code or reports.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) due to reliance on external CDN URLs, which is acceptable and standard practice.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code; all analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, justified by external CDN dependencies, which are common and trusted sources.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
