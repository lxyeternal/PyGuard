  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as generating embeddable HTML/JS for Jupyter widgets, matching the code's functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that data flows into JSON structures, escaped, and embedded into HTML. External URLs are from trusted CDNs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The code uses standard escaping (`escape_script`) and trusted CDN URLs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report rightly states the code is legitimate, with high confidence (1), and no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No issues.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with a focus on widget view generation and data serialization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly describes JSON serialization, escaping, and HTML generation. External URLs are CDN links.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. Use of regex for escaping is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Also concludes the code is safe, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still high.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code. No malicious behavior.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly elevated but justified given external URL handling).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose; the description matches the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes data serialization, escaping, and embedding.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious URL usage. The escaping is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected; high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes data serialization, escaping, and HTML output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscated code, and trusted CDN URLs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity; high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; matches code functionality.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly describes the data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious URL usage, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe and legitimate; confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a standard widget embedding utility.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) for external URL handling are reasonable given the use of CDN links, but no actual risk is introduced.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, due to reliance on external CDN URLs, but these are reputable sources, and no insecure practices are evident.\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility for embedding Jupyter widgets into HTML documents. It employs safe practices, such as escaping scripts and using trusted CDN URLs, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1             |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the content of the code.",
