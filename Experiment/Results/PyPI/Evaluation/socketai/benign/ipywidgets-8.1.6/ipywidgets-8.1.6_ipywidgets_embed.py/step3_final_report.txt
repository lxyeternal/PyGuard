  "purpose": "Functions for generating embeddable HTML/javascript of a widget, primarily for rendering Jupyter widgets in HTML documents.",
  "sources": "Widget instances, widget states, external CDN URLs for scripts, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML snippets, JSON data embedded within script tags, external script loads from CDN URLs.",
  "flows": "Widget data is serialized into JSON, escaped, and embedded into HTML templates; external scripts are loaded via URLs; widget view specs are escaped and inserted into HTML.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. External URLs are from reputable CDNs. Escaping functions are standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code handles widget state serialization, escaping, and HTML generation securely. It loads scripts from trusted sources, escapes script content to prevent injection, and does not execute untrusted code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The external CDN URLs are standard and reputable, reducing external dependency risks. The overall structure and data flow are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for embedding Jupyter widgets into HTML documents. It employs safe practices, uses trusted CDN URLs, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external CDN sources, which are reputable. The malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minor external dependency considerations.",
