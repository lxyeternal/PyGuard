  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious activity in Reports 1 and 2, warranting cautious scoring. Benign reports are appropriately scored. Slightly increasing malware score in Report 2 from 0.5 to 0.6 aligns better with suspicion level. Overall, the scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, indicating moderate security concern primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code usage."
