  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, hardcoded strings, input parameters, suspicious imports, network calls, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, subprocess executions, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data to sinks like network calls or system commands, possibly via dynamic code execution or obfuscated variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval, exec, obfuscated variable names, suspicious strings, network activity hints, minimal or no code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports indicate signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network or system interactions in Reports 1 and 2, leading to moderate malware and security risk scores. Benign reports (3, 4, 5) show no suspicious activity, with scores reflecting low risk. The suspicion levels justify malware scores around 0.5-0.6 and obfuscation scores around 0.7, with overall risk scores around 0.6 for suspicious reports. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors and analysis, with no significant discrepancies requiring adjustment.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits signs of obfuscation and potential malicious activity in Reports 1 and 2, warranting cautious scoring. Benign reports are appropriately scored. Slightly increasing malware score in Report 2 from 0.5 to 0.6 aligns better with suspicion level. Overall, the scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, indicating moderate security concern primarily driven by obfuscation and dynamic code usage.",
