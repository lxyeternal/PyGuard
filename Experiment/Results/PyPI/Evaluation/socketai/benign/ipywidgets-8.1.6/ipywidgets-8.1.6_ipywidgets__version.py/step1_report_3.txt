  "purpose": "Define version and protocol information for Jupyter widgets and related packages.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded version strings and protocol version strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; all are static version strings.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains static metadata with no suspicious or obfuscated behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple variable assignments of version strings and protocol versions for Jupyter widget packages. It includes no external input, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The code appears to be part of a standard package metadata module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The structure is straightforward, and the purpose is clearly to specify version information.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign metadata defining version information for Jupyter widget components. There are no malicious indicators or security risks present.",
