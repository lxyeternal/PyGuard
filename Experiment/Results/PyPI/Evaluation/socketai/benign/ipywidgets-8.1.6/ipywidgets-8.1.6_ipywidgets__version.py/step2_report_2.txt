  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static variable assignments defining version constants and protocol versions.\n- No untrusted data input, external dependencies, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is standard for package versioning and metadata declaration.\n\n**Review of the reported issues:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the content: malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores are all 0, and confidence is 1.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues are detected; the reports are accurate.\n- The risk scores are appropriate given the code's static, metadata-only nature.\n- Malware score is correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The overall security risk is correctly marked as 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is purely metadata, with no security concerns.\n- The reports' reasoning and scoring are justified and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, standard version declaration code, and poses no security threats.",
