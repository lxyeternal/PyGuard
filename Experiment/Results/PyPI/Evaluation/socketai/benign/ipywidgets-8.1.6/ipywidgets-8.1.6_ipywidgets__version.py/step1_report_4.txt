  "purpose": "Define version and protocol information for Jupyter widgets and related packages.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments defining version numbers and protocol versions.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; the code is straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments of version numbers and protocol versions, with comments clarifying their context. No dynamic execution, external data reading, or suspicious behavior is present. The structure is simple, readable, and typical for package metadata. No malicious intent or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata defining version information for Jupyter packages. It contains no malicious or suspicious code. The overall security risk is negligible.",
