  "purpose": "Define version constants and protocol versions for a Jupyter-related package or module.",
  "sources": "These are hardcoded string assignments defining version numbers and protocol versions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only assigns static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and typical for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for versioning purposes, with no dynamic execution, user input, or external dependencies involved. It is standard practice to declare such constants for package management and compatibility checks. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are apparent. The code does not contain any obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving as a version declaration section for a Jupyter package or module. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and poses no security risk.",
