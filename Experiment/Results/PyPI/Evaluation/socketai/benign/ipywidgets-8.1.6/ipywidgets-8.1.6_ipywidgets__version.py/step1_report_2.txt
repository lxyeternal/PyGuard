  "purpose": "Define and document version information for Jupyter widget packages and protocols.",
  "sources": "Constant variable assignments setting version strings and comments explaining protocol versions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; static version definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of version variables is normal; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static string values to version-related variables and contains explanatory comments. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, no external calls, or other behaviors that could be malicious. All variables appear to serve configuration or documentation purposes. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration and documentation snippet for a Jupyter package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
