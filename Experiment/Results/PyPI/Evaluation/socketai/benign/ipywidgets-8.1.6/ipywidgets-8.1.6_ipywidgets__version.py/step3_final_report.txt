  "purpose": "Static version and protocol declarations for a Jupyter package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments defining version numbers and protocol versions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow or external input.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static variable assignments with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments indicating version and protocol information for a Jupyter package. There are no dynamic elements, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is typical for package metadata and poses no security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata for versioning with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with its content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
