  "sources": "Static metadata fields such as name, version, author, description, URL, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with static package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It does not include dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated elements. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code aligns with standard packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a safe, standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
