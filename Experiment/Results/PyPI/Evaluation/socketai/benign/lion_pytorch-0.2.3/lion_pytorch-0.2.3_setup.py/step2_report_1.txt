  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe provided setup.py script is a standard Python packaging configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and other relevant info. All data appears static, hardcoded, and consistent with typical packaging practices. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original and functions as a typical setup script.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; static data and standard practices.\n- **Data flow or untrusted input:** None detected.\n- **Anomalies:** None; the code is conventional.\n\n### Analysis of each report:\n- **Report 1:** Completely benign, no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. Confidence 1.\n- **Report 2:** Same conclusion; standard setup script, no issues. Confidence 1.\n- **Report 3:** Same, no anomalies or malicious signs. Confidence 1.\n- **Report 4:** Again, standard packaging code, no suspicious behavior. Confidence 1.\n- **Report 5:** Consistent with previous, no signs of malicious activity. Confidence 1.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, and given the static, straightforward nature of the code, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or suspicious elements.\n- The dependency on 'torch>=1.6' is standard for ML packages and not suspicious.\n- No external data sources, no code obfuscation, no embedded malicious code.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No adjustments needed. The reports are consistent, and the code is safe.",
