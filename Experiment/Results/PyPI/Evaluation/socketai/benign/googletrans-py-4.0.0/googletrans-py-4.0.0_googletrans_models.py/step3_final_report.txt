{
  "purpose": "Data models for translation and language detection responses",
  "sources": "No active data input; the code defines classes with constructors and string/dict methods",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data handling",
  "flows": "Instantiation of classes with provided parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The __dict__ methods are non-standard (should be renamed to to_dict()), but this is stylistic, not security-related",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple data classes modeling translation and detection results, with no network calls, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The import of Response from httpx is unused, which is harmless but unnecessary. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The __dict__ methods are misnamed but do not pose security risks. The code is straightforward and safe, serving as data containers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Minor stylistic improvements could be made, but they do not impact security.",
