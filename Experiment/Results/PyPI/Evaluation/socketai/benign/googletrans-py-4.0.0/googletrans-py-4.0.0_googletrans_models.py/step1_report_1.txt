  "purpose": "Data structures and classes for handling translation and language detection responses.",
  "sources": "Response object in Base class constructor; input parameters in Translated, Detected classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flow manipulation, network calls, or external data processing within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code mainly defines data containers without processing untrusted input in a dangerous manner.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward, primarily data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for representing translation results and language detection results. There are no external calls, no data manipulation beyond object attribute assignment, and no dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of response objects is limited to storing and representing data without processing or transmitting it maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data model for translation and language detection results with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
