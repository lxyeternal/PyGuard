{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for handling translation and language detection results, mainly for organizing and representing data related to translation responses.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or untrusted data directly; it relies on data passed into constructors.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks, code execution, or other effects. No output functions or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the initialization parameters to internal class attributes and through __str__, __unicode__, and __dict__ methods for representation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The classes serve as data containers for translation and detection results. They include methods for string representation and dictionaries but do not perform any operations that could lead to security risks. There are no external data reads, network operations, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard data modeling code for translation results with no malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or dangerous.",
