  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily data modeling classes for translation and language detection responses.\n- No network operations, external data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating the reviewers are quite certain about the benign nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The use of the Response object is limited to storage; no untrusted data is processed insecurely.\n- The code's purpose is solely data encapsulation and representation.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The only minor point is the `__dict__` method in the data classes, which is unconventional (usually `__dict__` is a built-in attribute). However, this is not inherently malicious or risky, just a naming concern. It doesn't affect security but might be confusing or lead to misuse.\n\n**Score evaluations:**\n- The malware scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just because it’s a data model with minimal risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
