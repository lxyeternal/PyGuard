{
  "purpose": "Data models for translation and language detection results, including classes for response handling and object representations.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), class attributes, and potentially input parameters such as response objects and data passed to constructors.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no code writes untrusted data directly to outputs or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs into class attributes; no data flows into dangerous sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data container classes with constructors to initialize attributes. It includes string representations (__str__, __unicode__) for debugging or display purposes, but no code execution, network calls, or data processing that could lead to security issues. The response class is only imported but not used directly in the code shown. Overall, it appears to be straightforward data modeling code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data model classes for translation and detection results, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious code. It functions as structured data containers without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
