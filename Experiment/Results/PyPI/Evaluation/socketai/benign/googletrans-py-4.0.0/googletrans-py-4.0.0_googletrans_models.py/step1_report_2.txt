  "purpose": "Define classes for handling translation results and language detection data.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameters to class constructors, such as Response objects and string/ list arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data being used insecurely or being sent over the network within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into class attributes; no data processing or transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data model classes with constructors and string representations. It handles input parameters for translation and detection results. No network calls, no external data fetching, nor any insecure handling of data is present. The classes are primarily for organizing data; they do not execute any malicious actions or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely structural, used for storing and representing translation and detection data. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated/malicious code. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
