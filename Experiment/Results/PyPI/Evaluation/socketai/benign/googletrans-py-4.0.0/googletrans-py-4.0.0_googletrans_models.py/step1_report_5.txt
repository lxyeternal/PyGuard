  "purpose": "Data models for translation and language detection responses, encapsulating response data and related attributes.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted data directly from input sources.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or outputs data to external systems or untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "Data is passed into class constructors; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The __dict__ method is non-standard (should be @property or named differently), but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data model classes for translation and language detection results, including __str__, __unicode__, and __dict__ methods for formatting. It uses safe string formatting and standard Python data structures. No external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward and primarily for data encapsulation. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely for data modeling and presentation without any malicious intent. There are no suspicious patterns, no external data leaks, and no insecure practices observed.",
