  "purpose": "Provide a free Google Translate API wrapper in Python for translation services.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'Translator' from 'googletrans.client' and constants from 'googletrans.constants'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network connections or data leaks are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from source to sink observed in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Translator class and constants, and defines module metadata. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or contain potentially malicious code. The description suggests it offers translation functionality, but this snippet alone does not implement or invoke such behavior. No anomalies or security issues are detected based solely on these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module wrapper for the googletrans library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely safe, assuming the 'googletrans' library is legitimate. There are no embedded secrets or malicious behaviors in this snippet.",
