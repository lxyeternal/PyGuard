{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper or interface for the Google Translate API using the googletrans library.",
  "sources": "Imports from googletrans.client and googletrans.constants, and the module's own string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not perform any data output, network connection, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily imports modules and sets module attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. The description claims a 'free API', but the code itself does not implement any API logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module-level metadata and imports essential components from the googletrans package. There is no execution of network calls, user input handling, or data processing. It appears to be a minimal wrapper or configuration file, likely part of a larger package. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The claim of a 'free API' appears to be a description rather than an actual implementation of a service; the code relies on existing googletrans library functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup or import module for the googletrans package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no suspicious code patterns or security issues present.",
