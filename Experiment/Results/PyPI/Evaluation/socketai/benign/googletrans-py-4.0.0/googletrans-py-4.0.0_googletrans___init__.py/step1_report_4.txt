{
  "purpose": "Provides a free Google Translate API wrapper for Python using the googletrans library.",
  "sources": "Imports from googletrans.client and googletrans.constants, which are external libraries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network operations, file operations, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines public API components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Translator class and constants from the googletrans library and defines module metadata. There are no network calls, data handling, or code execution. The comments suggest functionality but do not perform any operations. The package relies on external dependencies, which are standard for such wrappers. No malicious or suspicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple wrapper module providing access to the googletrans library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks by itself. It serves as an interface to an existing translation library without any suspicious or harmful code.",
