  "purpose": "Minimal module importing components from the googletrans library, serving as a wrapper or configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements from googletrans.client and googletrans.constants",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or network activity",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only imports modules and defines metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that defines metadata and imports from an external library without executing any logic or network activity. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious code. The description claiming a 'free API' is likely marketing language, not functional code. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no suspicious patterns or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minimal import structure and lack of execution logic confirm its safety. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by the misleading marketing claim but does not reflect actual vulnerabilities.",
