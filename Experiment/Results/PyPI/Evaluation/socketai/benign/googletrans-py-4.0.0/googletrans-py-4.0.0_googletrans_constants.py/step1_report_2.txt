{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and data structures for a translation service, including URL lists, language codes, and configuration settings.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments and large tuples/dictionaries initialized in code; no external data inputs or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; no network or file operations, no execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; code primarily initializes constants and mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; extensive URL list could be suspicious if used maliciously, but as static data, it’s benign. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up constants such as URL lists, language code mappings, and configuration flags. It does not contain any functions, user input handling, or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. No data is processed from external or untrusted sources, nor are there any suspicious code flows or side effects. The large list of URLs appears to be a comprehensive set of translation service domains, likely for validation or selection purposes, not malicious activity. No backdoors, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of static data definitions and configuration constants for a translation service module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
