  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes that the code is purely declarative, with static constants and mappings, no dynamic or malicious code present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The extensive URL list is consistent with legitimate Google domains, not suspicious.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed. The scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static data, no external data processing, and benign URL lists.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, static configuration data with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** The extensive list of Google domains is normal for regional support; no malicious intent is inferred.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Static constants, no dynamic code, no external input, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** The data appears legitimate and benign.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—static configuration data, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** The extensive URL list is consistent with legitimate Google domains, not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, benign nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is justified across all reports.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is a benign configuration module, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-understood as static configuration data, and poses no security threat.",
