{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration constants, supported URLs, language codes, and mappings for a translation-related library or module.",
  "sources": "Constants and data structures that contain hardcoded URLs, language codes, and settings.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data flows to external systems or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Extensive list of URLs may seem suspicious but are consistent with multilingual translation services. No dynamic execution, no hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining constants, URLs, language code mappings, and default values. The URL lists are extensive but appear to be legitimate Google translation service subdomains, possibly for regional or fallback servers. No code that reads external inputs, performs network operations, or executes dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The data structures and constants are consistent with language translation functionalities. No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security issues. The only potential concern is the large volume of hardcoded URLs, but given their nature, they are part of the application's configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with extensive hardcoded URL and language data. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate configuration setup for a translation tool or library. No indicators of malware, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
