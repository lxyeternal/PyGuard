{
  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining user agent, Google Translate service URLs, language mappings, and constants for a translation module.",
  "sources": "Predefined URL lists, language code dictionaries, and constants; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; extensive URL lists are legitimate Google domains, and no obfuscation or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants, URL lists, and language mappings. There are no executable logic, input handling, or network operations. The URL lists include numerous Google domains, both regional and global, which are typical for translation services. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets are detected. The code appears to be a benign configuration module intended for use in a translation library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with no malicious or suspicious content. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores should reflect this benign nature.",
