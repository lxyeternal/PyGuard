{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and mappings for Google Translate service URLs, languages, and special cases, likely for a translation library or API client.",
  "sources": "Constants, URL lists, and language dictionaries; no input reading functions or data ingestion points.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no output or network operations shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily sets static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The extensive list of URLs and language mappings are static data structures. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of large static data structures: URL tuples, a dictionary for special language code cases, language name mappings, and their inverses. No functions, data processing, or input/output operations are present. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The structure appears to be configuration for a translation service, with no signs of covert or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static configuration module containing URLs, language mappings, and constants for a translation-related application. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
