{
  "purpose": "Defines URLs used for making Google Translate requests, likely for a translation utility or service.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for URLs; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no sensitive data handling or network communication beyond URL definition.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code merely stores URL templates.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscated parts or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns static URL strings to variables, which are used for making HTTP requests to Google Translate endpoints. There is no user input, no dynamic URL generation beyond string formatting placeholders, and no code execution or data processing. The code appears to be part of a larger module that interacts with Google Translate API, but on its own, it poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining static URL endpoints for translation requests. There is no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious activity within this snippet.",
