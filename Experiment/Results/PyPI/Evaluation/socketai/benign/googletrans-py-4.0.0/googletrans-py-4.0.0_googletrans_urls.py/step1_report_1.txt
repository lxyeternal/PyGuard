  "flows": "No data flows from input to output; static URL strings only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward URL definitions with no obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple string assignments defining URLs for Google Translate API endpoints. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or dynamic data handling. The URLs are formatted with placeholders for 'host', but no code dynamically inserts or manipulates these URLs. There is no indication of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a configuration or constants module for other scripts to use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet setting URL endpoints for translation services. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
