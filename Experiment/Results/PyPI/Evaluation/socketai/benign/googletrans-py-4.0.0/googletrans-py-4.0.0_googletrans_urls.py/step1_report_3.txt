  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only URL string assignments.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of URL string definitions without any unusual or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines static URL strings intended for making requests to Google Translate services. There are no inputs, no processing, and no dynamic behavior. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The URLs include placeholders for host substitution but do not perform any network requests or data handling within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as configuration or constants for URL endpoints. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
