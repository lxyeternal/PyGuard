  "purpose": "Define URLs for making Google Translate requests.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output statements.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of URL templates could be manipulated if combined with dynamic code, but the code itself is static and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of URL string constants intended for use in making HTTP requests to Google Translate endpoints. There are no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. The URLs are standard and correspond to Google Translate's web API endpoints. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations on its own and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines URL templates for Google Translate API requests with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears benign and is likely part of a larger project responsible for making translation requests.",
