  "purpose": "Defines static URLs for Google Translate API requests.",
  "sources": "String assignments for URL endpoints with placeholders for host substitution.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static URL strings without dynamic data or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward URL definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining API endpoints. There are no functions, data processing, or network requests. The URLs are standard, publicly known endpoints with placeholders for host substitution, indicating they are templates. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic URL generation is present. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet defining static URLs for Google Translate API endpoints. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious intent, and is free of obfuscation or suspicious behavior. The reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the scoring is appropriate.",
