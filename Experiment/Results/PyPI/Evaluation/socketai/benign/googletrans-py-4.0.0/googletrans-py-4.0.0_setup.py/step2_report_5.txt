  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the script is benign, with a confidence of 1. It notes no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malware.\n- **Evaluation:** The code is a straightforward setup script, reading static files, parsing metadata, and calling `setuptools.setup()`. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the assessment.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, the code is safe.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed reasoning. It notes no external connections, no suspicious code, and standard practices.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly elevated, but given the lack of any suspicious activity, this is acceptable.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as previous, standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected. The code only reads files and sets up package metadata.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low or zero risk, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Malware score:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Potential concerns:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
