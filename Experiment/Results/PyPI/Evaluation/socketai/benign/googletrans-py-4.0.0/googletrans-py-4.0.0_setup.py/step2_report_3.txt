  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly states that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It notes the absence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (since it's a standard setup script with no issues). The confidence is high.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The risk score could be lowered to 0, but 0.5 is acceptable as a conservative estimate for any setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it finds no suspicious activity, external connections, or malicious code. It mentions that the script is benign and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (very low, as expected). Confidence is high.\n- **Justification:** No issues identified. The risk score is appropriate; it could be zero, but 0.1 remains conservative.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, no malicious behavior or suspicious code detected. It emphasizes the standard nature of the setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0. The risk score is justified.\n- **Justification:** No concerns here; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (again, a conservative low risk).\n- **Justification:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also aligns with previous findings; no malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low or zero, reflecting the benign nature of the setup script.\n- **Potential issues:** The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, I would set this to 0 for all reports, unless there's additional context suggesting otherwise.\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the code's actual behavior.",
