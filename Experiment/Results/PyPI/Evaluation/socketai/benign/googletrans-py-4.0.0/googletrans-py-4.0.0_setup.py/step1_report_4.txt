{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including functions to retrieve version, description, and readme content, and the setup() call to package the project.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (get_file), reading 'requirements.txt', and potentially user-provided data through file paths.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data; it only reads files and uses static data for package setup.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; standard setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup routines, reading static files and extracting metadata with regex. No input validation issues, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity or credential handling. All file operations are standard and confined to the package directory. The code does not contain any malicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to prepare and package the code for distribution.",
