  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'googletrans-py' Python project.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (get_file), reading requirements.txt, parsing __init__.py for version and description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, command execution, or unsafe handling; all data used internally for setup purposes.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata from files and assembles package configuration; no untrusted data flows to critical security-sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code. Uses standard setup.py patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script reads metadata from package files and requirements.txt to configure package installation. The get_file function safely reads files, and the regex patterns used are standard for extracting version and description info. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, external network calls, or malicious logic. The code follows typical setup script conventions with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
