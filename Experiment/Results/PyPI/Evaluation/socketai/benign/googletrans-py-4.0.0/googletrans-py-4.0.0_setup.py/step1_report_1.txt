{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'googletrans-py' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; reading '__init__.py' for version and description; user input is not explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data directly; no data leaks or insecure outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dependency installation and package setup involve static files and known metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'try-except' for file reading is standard; no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures. No hardcoded secrets aside from metadata; no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package metadata and dependencies from files, then uses 'setuptools' for packaging. The code is straightforward, with functions to parse version, description, and readme files. It does not perform any network operations, dynamic execution, or include any suspicious behavior. It appears to be a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe for use and does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
