{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package called 'googletrans-py' by reading package metadata, requirements, and configuration data for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads files: '__init__.py' for version and description, 'README.md' for long description, and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data output or external connections are present.",
  "flows": "Reads package files for metadata; no flow from untrusted input to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard setup script structure. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a typical Python package setup script. It safely reads files for version, description, and requirements, then passes this data to setuptools.setup(). There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The pattern matching and file handling are straightforward, with proper exception handling for file I/O. All dependencies are sourced locally or from the package files, with no external or untrusted input influencing critical behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign and standard setup configuration file for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
