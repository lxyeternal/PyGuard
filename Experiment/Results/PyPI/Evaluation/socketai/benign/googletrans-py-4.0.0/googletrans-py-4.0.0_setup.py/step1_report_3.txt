{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'googletrans-py' to manage installation, versioning, and metadata.",
  "sources": "File reads for '__init__.py' to extract version and description, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external network or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading files ('__init__.py', 'requirements.txt') and passing data into 'setup()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code follows standard setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files to extract metadata and dependencies for packaging. Functions such as 'get_version' and 'get_description' parse '__init__.py' files for package info. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The code adheres to standard practices for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no malicious indicators, suspicious behaviors, or security risks present.",
