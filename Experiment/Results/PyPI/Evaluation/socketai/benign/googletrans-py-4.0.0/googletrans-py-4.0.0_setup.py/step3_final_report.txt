{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library, extracting metadata from files and passing it to setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads from '__init__.py', 'README.md', and 'requirements.txt' files.",
  "sinks": "None; operates solely on local static files without untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents, parses metadata via regex, and supplies data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file reading and regex parsing with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reading to extract version, description, and requirements, then calls setuptools.setup() with this data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The regex patterns are simple and operate on local files, posing no injection risk. The code structure is standard for Python package setup scripts, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe operation.",
