{
  "purpose": "The code provides a translation service using Google Translate API via HTTP requests, enabling translation and language detection functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters (text, src, dest), environment via imported modules, and URLs from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST and GET requests to external translation services, processes and returns translated text and language detection results.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into translation functions, which construct requests and send them over network; responses are parsed and used to produce output objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No obfuscated code; the logic appears straightforward. No dynamic code execution or unusual data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a translation class leveraging external Google translation endpoints, constructing request payloads and parsing responses. It handles both new and legacy translation methods, including language detection. It uses random selection among service URLs for load distribution. The request payloads are generated via internal methods, and external HTTP requests are made using httpx. The code handles potential exceptions and response validation. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. All network interactions appear to be legitimate API calls to public endpoints with no sensitive data hardcoded or transmitted.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to implement a standard Google Translate API client with typical functionality, no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It securely manages requests, and no hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident.",
