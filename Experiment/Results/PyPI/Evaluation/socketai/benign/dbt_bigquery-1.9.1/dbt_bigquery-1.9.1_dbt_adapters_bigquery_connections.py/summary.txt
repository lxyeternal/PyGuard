  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured BigQuery adapter with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and justified by the operational context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are accurate and consistent with the detailed analysis."
