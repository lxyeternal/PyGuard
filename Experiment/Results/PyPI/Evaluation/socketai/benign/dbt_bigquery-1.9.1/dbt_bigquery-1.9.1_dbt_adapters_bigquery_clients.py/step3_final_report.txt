{
  "purpose": "Create Google Cloud clients (BigQuery, Storage, Dataproc) using provided credentials with standard SDK practices.",
  "sources": "Credentials object attributes accessed during client instantiation, environment variables indirectly via credentials, version info for user agent.",
  "sinks": "Client constructors with credentials, logging statements, network calls during client initialization.",
  "flows": "Credentials flow from input to client creation functions; error handling redirects to credential setup; version info used in user agent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard Google Cloud SDK patterns for client creation, with proper error handling and retries. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. Logging is informational and non-sensitive. Credential handling appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The functions are straightforward, and the overall structure is clear and maintainable. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for creating Google Cloud clients with proper credential management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign and low-risk profile.",
