  "purpose": "Defines the package path based on the current file location",
  "sources": "Reads the current file location using os.path.dirname(__file__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns a value to a variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for obtaining the current file directory",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module and assigns the directory name of the current file to PACKAGE_PATH. There are no inputs beyond the __file__ variable, which is a standard Python feature. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as network access, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. It appears to be a simple configuration or setup statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and used for determining the current file's directory. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
