  "purpose": "Determine the directory path of the current script file",
  "sources": "Reading the special variable '__file__' to get the current script's filename",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or harmful actions",
  "flows": "Source ('__file__') to 'os.path.dirname' to get the directory path",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module and assigns to 'PACKAGE_PATH' the directory containing the current script file. This is a common pattern for setting a base path for relative resource loading. No data is being transmitted, executed dynamically, or manipulated maliciously. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior; it performs a simple, benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply determines the script's directory path for potential further use.",
