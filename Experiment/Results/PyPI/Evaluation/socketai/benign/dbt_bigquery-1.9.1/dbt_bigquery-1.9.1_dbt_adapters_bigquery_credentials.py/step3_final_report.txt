{
  "purpose": "This code manages Google Cloud BigQuery credentials, supporting multiple authentication methods, validation, and SDK verification via external commands.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, JSON keyfiles, tokens, and parameters provided during credential instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Creates credential objects for API access; executes system commands for SDK verification and login.",
  "flows": "Credential data flows from input sources into credential objects; external commands verify SDK presence before proceeding.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; external command execution is static and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard credential management with validation and multiple auth methods. External commands are used for SDK verification, which is typical. Base64 validation is proper, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The credential handling is secure, and the external command usage is safe given static commands. No backdoors or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured credential management module for Google BigQuery, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score of approximately 0.2 is justified, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero. Overall, the code poses minimal security concerns.",
