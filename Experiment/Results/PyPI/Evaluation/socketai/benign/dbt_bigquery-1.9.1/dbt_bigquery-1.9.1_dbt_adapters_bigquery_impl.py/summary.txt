  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured BigQuery adapter with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Slightly elevated risk scores reflect potential SQL injection if inputs are malicious, but no active threats are present. Overall, the supply chain security risk is low."
