  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of extend_path from pkgutil, usage of __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import of extend_path to modify __path__, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for namespace package support.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function and applies it to __path__ with __name__, a common pattern in Python for namespace packages. It involves no external input, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. The code's purpose is to enable resource discovery across multiple directories. No suspicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for namespace package support. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
