  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package resource loading",
  "sources": "Imports 'extend_path' from 'pkgutil' and modifies '__path__' variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths leading to untrusted data or effects",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Code simply modifies '__path__' using standard library function without any unusual or obfuscated behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library function 'extend_path' from 'pkgutil' and applies it to '__path__' with the module name '__name__'. This is a common pattern in Python packages to support namespace packages, ensuring proper resource discovery across multiple directories. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or unusual operations. The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical namespace package extension without any malicious intent or security risks. It is standard, harmless code to support package resource loading.",
