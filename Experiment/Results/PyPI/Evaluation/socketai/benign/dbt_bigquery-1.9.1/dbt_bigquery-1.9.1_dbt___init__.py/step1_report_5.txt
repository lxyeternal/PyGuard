{
  "purpose": "The code extends the package's __path__ attribute to support namespace packages across multiple directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the existing __path__ variable, which is a package attribute, and the __name__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "The source __path__ and __name__ flow into the extend_path function, which modifies __path__ for namespace packaging.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package support; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'extend_path' from 'pkgutil', then reassigns __path__ to the extended version for the current package __name__. This pattern is typical for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code does not perform any network communication, data processing, or system modifications. It appears to be standard boilerplate for namespace package support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard namespace package support code with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
