  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Summary of findings across all reports:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the script is a standard setup script for a Python package (`dbt-bigquery`), performing environment checks, dependency management, and package metadata configuration.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of `exec()` to evaluate the contents of the version file (`__version__.py`). This pattern is common but introduces a potential security risk if the version file is compromised or maliciously altered.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, network activity, or obfuscated code is present in the script.\n- The reports agree that the overall risk is low if the version file is trusted and controlled.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The only noteworthy issue is the use of `exec()` on the version file, which could execute malicious code if the file is tampered with. This is a known pattern but should be flagged as a potential security concern.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No factual errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports. They correctly interpret the code's behavior.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The reports assign `securityRisk` scores mostly around 0.2–0.3, which seems reasonable given the `exec()` usage.\n- The `malware` scores are 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The use of `exec()` on a local version file is a known pattern but can be exploited if the version file is compromised. This warrants a cautious but low score, which the reports reflect.\n- Since no malicious code is present, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The overall `securityRisk` scores are slightly above 0.2–0.3, which is reasonable given the `exec()` concern.\n\n### Potential over- or under-estimation:\n- The reports seem consistent and appropriately cautious.\n- No report suggests a higher risk than warranted.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting a well-understood code pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- The code does not contain malicious activity. The `exec()` usage is a known pattern but not malicious per se.  \n- **Estimated malware score: 0**\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- No obfuscation is present.  \n- **Estimated obfuscated score: 0**\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- The main concern is the `exec()` pattern, which could be exploited if the version file is compromised.  \n- Given the context, a moderate risk score around 0.2–0.3 is justified.  \n- To be conservative, I would assign: **0.2**\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The script is standard and does not contain malware.\n- The main security concern is the `exec()` pattern, which should be flagged but does not imply malicious intent.\n- Ensuring the version file (`__version__.py`) is secured and verified reduces the risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2            |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the overall analysis.",
