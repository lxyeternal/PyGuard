{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package for the dbt-bigquery adapter, managing dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, Path objects for reading version and README, import statements, and exec() for reading version info.",
  "sinks": "exec() function that executes code from a file, potentially executing malicious code embedded in the version file.",
  "flows": "Version file content read by exec() -> executed in a local attribute dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code read from a file, which could contain malicious code. No other suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment checks, dependency management, and package setup. The only notable risk is the use of exec() to dynamically evaluate the contents of a version file. If the version file contains malicious code, this could be exploited. However, under normal circumstances, this is a common pattern to dynamically load version info. No other malicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup script for a Python package with a single potential risk point being the use of exec() to evaluate version info. If the version file is trusted and controlled, the risk is minimal. No malware or malicious behavior is evident.",
