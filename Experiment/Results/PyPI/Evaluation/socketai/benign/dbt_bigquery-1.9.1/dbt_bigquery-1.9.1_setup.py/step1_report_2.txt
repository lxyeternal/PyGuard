  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and install a Python package called 'dbt-bigquery', including version checks, dependency management, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, Path(__file__), VERSION.read_text()",
  "sinks": "exec(VERSION.read_text(), attributes)",
  "flows": "Reading version data from a file and executing it to set the version attribute",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code read from a file, which can be risky if the file contents are malicious or tampered with",
  "analysis": "The script performs a Python version check and attempts to import a specific module. It reads version information from a file and uses exec() to dynamically execute its contents to extract the version string. The setup() function configures package metadata and dependencies. The use of exec() on file content poses a potential security risk if the file is compromised, as it can execute arbitrary code. However, in a controlled build environment, this is a common pattern for version extraction. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is structured for package setup and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with a typical version extraction pattern that involves executing version code from a file. Although exec() introduces a potential risk if the version file is compromised, this is a common practice in package setup scripts. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware are detected.",
