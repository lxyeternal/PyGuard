  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the use of exec() for version extraction, which is a known pattern but should be secured by ensuring the version file is trusted. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low but warrants caution regarding the version file's integrity."
