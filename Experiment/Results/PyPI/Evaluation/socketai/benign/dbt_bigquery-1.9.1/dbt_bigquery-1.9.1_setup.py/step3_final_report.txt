  "flows": "Reading version file with read_text() and executing its content via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on a local version file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks, dependency management, and package setup. The primary security concern is the use of exec() to evaluate the version file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The exec() pattern is common but introduces a potential risk if the version file is untrusted. The scores reflect this: malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the use of exec() for version extraction, which is a known pattern but should be secured by ensuring the version file is trusted. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low but warrants caution regarding the version file's integrity.",
