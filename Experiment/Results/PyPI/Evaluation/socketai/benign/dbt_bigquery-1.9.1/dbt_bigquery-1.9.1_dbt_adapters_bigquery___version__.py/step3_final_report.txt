  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable, likely for package or script version declaration.",
  "sources": "None; static assignment with no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, external communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '1.9.1' to the variable 'version'. It involves no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The code is typical for version declaration and does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a conclusion of no malicious intent or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
