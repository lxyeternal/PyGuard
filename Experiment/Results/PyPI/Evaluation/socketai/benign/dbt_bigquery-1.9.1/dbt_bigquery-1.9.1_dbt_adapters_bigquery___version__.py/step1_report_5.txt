  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or script",

  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flow since the code only assigns a value to a variable",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; extremely minimal code with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string value '1.9.1' to a variable named 'version'. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external interactions. The code is minimal and typical for version declaration in Python packages or scripts. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks.",
