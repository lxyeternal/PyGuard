  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only performs a simple assignment of a static string `'1.9.1'` to a variable named `version`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, or processing that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that this code snippet is benign.\n   - No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning; the logic is sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero risk, and the code is trivial, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The risk scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware: 0`.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious activity, so this score is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code snippet is entirely benign, with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My personal estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThere is no indication of any threat or malicious intent in this code fragment.",
