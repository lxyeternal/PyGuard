  "purpose": "The code manages submission of Python Spark jobs to Google Cloud Dataproc, uploading code to GCS, and configuring jobs for execution in the cloud environment.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from parsed_model (schema, alias, config), credentials (dataproc_region, gcs_bucket, dataproc_cluster_name, dataproc_batch), and external parameters such as compiled_code.",
  "sinks": "Uploads code to GCS via self._storage_client, submits jobs to Dataproc via API clients, and potentially executes user-provided code in cloud jobs.",
  "flows": "Source: parsed_model and credentials -> _write_to_gcs uploads code -> submit methods send requests to Dataproc API -> Job runs in cloud environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no hidden backdoors or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cloud job management tasks: validating input parameters, uploading code to GCS, and submitting jobs via API clients. It uses explicit API calls with clear parameters, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. The potential security concern is that arbitrary code may be uploaded and executed, but this is inherent to the workflow and not indicative of malicious intent within the code itself. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are found. The code relies on external inputs for code content and configuration, which could be malicious if supplied maliciously, but the static code is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for managing and submitting cloud-based Spark jobs. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risk of executing uploaded code but not due to malicious code within this module.",
