  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for managing and submitting cloud-based Spark jobs. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the inherent risk of executing uploaded code but not due to malicious code within this module."
