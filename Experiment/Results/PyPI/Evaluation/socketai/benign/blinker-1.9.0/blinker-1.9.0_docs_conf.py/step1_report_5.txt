  "purpose": "Configuration for generating Sphinx documentation for the Blinker project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pallets_sphinx_themes; get_version function call; string literals; dictionary and list definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable usage; all data is static or imported functions.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; static configuration data is used directly without processing user input or external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports a theme version, sets project metadata, and configures documentation appearance and links. The get_version function is used to retrieve version info from a package named 'blinker'. The configuration is static, and there are no indications of malicious activity or malicious data handling. The use of third-party libraries is typical for Sphinx configurations, and there is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or other security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Sphinx documentation configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It relies on a legitimate package for versioning and uses static, well-understood patterns.",
