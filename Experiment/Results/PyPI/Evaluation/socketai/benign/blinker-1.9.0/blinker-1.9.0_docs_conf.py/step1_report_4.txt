  "purpose": "Configuration script for generating Sphinx documentation for the Blinker project",
  "sources": "Import from pallets_sphinx_themes, get_version function call",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data directly; mostly static configuration",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static setup",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports version and project link functions from an external theme library, sets various configuration options for Sphinx documentation, and defines URLs for project links and issues. The get_version function is used to dynamically obtain the project version, which appears standard. There are no input or data processing mechanisms that handle untrusted data or perform network activities. The code solely defines static configurations for documentation rendering, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
