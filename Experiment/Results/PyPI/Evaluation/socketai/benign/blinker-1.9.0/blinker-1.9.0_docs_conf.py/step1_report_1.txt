  "purpose": "Configuration for generating Sphinx documentation for the Blinker project.",
  "sources": "Importing version information from pallets_sphinx_themes, static paths, and project metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to or executes untrusted data; static paths and URLs are predefined.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows to critical functions or external calls; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed. Use of get_version from pallets_sphinx_themes appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Sphinx documentation configuration, importing version info, defining extensions, themes, and context. All data sources are static or derived from trusted library functions. No input reading, user data handling, or network activity is present. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Sphinx configuration file for documentation. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and intended solely for documentation generation.",
