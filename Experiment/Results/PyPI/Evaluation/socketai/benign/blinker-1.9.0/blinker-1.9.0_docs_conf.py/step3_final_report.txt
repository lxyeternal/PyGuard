  "purpose": "Standard Sphinx configuration for project documentation, importing version info and setting themes, links, and static paths.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`get_version`, theme and link configurations, static paths, project info).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and relies on trusted libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx setup script. It imports version info via `get_version` from a trusted package, sets static theme options, URLs, and project metadata. There is no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The use of `get_version` is standard and safe. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The configuration is static and straightforward, with no potential for malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
