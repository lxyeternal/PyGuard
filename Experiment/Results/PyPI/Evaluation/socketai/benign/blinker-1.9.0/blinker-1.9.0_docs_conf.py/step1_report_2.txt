  "purpose": "Configure Sphinx documentation for the Blinker project, including theme, extensions, links, and other presentation settings.",
  "sources": "Importing get_version from pallets_sphinx_themes, calling get_version with 'blinker'.",
  "sinks": "Use of get_version output for versioning and html_title.",
  "flows": "get_version is called to retrieve version info, which is then used in the html_title.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden logic. The get_version function is a standard utility to fetch version info; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from a known theme package, pallets_sphinx_themes. It calls get_version with 'blinker' to obtain release and version information, which is safely used in setting the HTML title. The configuration defines various extensions, theme options, and project links, all standard for Sphinx documentation setup. No data is read from or written to external sources other than the get_version function, which is expected to retrieve version info. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no code injection points, or unsafe practices observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script for documentation. It safely uses an external library to fetch version info and configures documentation display options. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks are present.",
