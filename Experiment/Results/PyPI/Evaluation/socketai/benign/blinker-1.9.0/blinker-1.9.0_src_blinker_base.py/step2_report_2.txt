  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings, scores, and implications to determine the overall security posture.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes a signaling system with support for weak references, context managers, and named signals.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. The code uses standard patterns for event handling, weak references, and internal bookkeeping.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar signaling framework with connection/disconnection and event emission.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity. Uses weak references and cleanup callbacks as standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Comments:** The assessment is consistent; no malicious behavior or suspicious constructs. Slightly higher confidence and zero security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Again, a signaling system with support for weak references and async/sync dispatch.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Receivers are user-defined, which could be malicious if compromised, but this is normal.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (still low, but acknowledging that receivers could be malicious if untrusted)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly notes that the system itself is benign; potential risk depends on receiver code, which is outside the scope of this package.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar signaling framework.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, proper use of weak references, no external system calls.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Comments:** Consistent with previous reports; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard event signaling with support for weak references.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Comments:** Same conclusion; the code is a typical signaling system.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is consistent with a standard signal/slot pattern.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree there is no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code content.\n- **Security Risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting that the main risk could be if user-defined receivers are malicious, but the package itself is safe.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9-0.95), consistent with the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk Score:** **0.1 - 0.2** (low, primarily due to potential misuse of user-defined receivers, but not a package-level vulnerability)\n\n**Overall Security Posture:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured event signaling system with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain security issues. The potential risk is mainly from how the receivers are implemented or used, which is outside the scope of this package.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
