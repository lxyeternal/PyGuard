  "purpose": "A signaling system implementing event notification with support for weak references, context managers, and named signals.",
  "sources": "Receivers invoked during send, send_async, or connect; internal data structures managing weak references and signal connections.",
  "sinks": "Receiver functions called with sender and kwargs; weakref cleanup callbacks that modify internal state.",
  "flows": "Receivers are called during send/send_async; weakref cleanup functions trigger on garbage collection to disconnect references.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of weak references and cleanup callbacks is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard event signaling framework with support for weak references, context managers, and named signals. It manages internal data structures for connections and cleanup, with no external system calls or malicious payloads. Receivers are user-defined callables, which could be malicious if untrusted, but this is inherent to callback systems and not a flaw. The malware score is 0, as there are no malicious payloads or backdoors. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and readable. The security risk score is low (around 0.1-0.2), primarily reflecting the potential misuse if receivers are malicious, but this is outside the scope of the package's implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured signaling system with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of user-defined receivers, which is typical for callback-based event systems. The overall supply chain security risk is very low, and the scores assigned by the reports are appropriate.",
