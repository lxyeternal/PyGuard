  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured signaling system with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of user-defined receivers, which is typical for callback-based event systems. The overall supply chain security risk is very low, and the scores assigned by the reports are appropriate."
