{
  "purpose": "Defines utility classes and functions for symbol management, object identification, and weak references.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from input parameters of functions and methods (e.g., 'name', 'obj', 'callback'). Uses 'inspect' module to analyze objects.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; weak references are created but do not lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions ('make_id', 'make_ref'), which generate identifiers or weak references; no data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of weak references and symbol cache is standard practice; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions and classes: Symbol manages singleton-like symbol instances; make_id generates stable identifiers based on object type and properties; make_ref creates weak references with optional callbacks. The code uses 'inspect' to differentiate methods from other objects and handles various types appropriately. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present. Functions perform common utility roles with standard implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code without malicious intent. It manages symbols, generates object identifiers, and creates weak references securely. No indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
