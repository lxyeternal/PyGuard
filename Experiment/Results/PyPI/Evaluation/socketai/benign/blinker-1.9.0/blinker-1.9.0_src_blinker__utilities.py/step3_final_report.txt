  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for symbol management, stable object identification, and weak referencing in Python.",
  "sources": "inspect module for method detection, object parameters passed to make_id and make_ref functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or external outputs generated.",
  "flows": "Input objects flow through make_id and make_ref functions, with no external or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard Python features, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a singleton-like Symbol class, functions for generating stable identifiers (make_id) handling methods, strings, and objects, and functions for creating weak references (make_ref) with special handling for bound methods. All features are standard, safe, and do not involve external data, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified. Overall, the code is safe for use.",
