{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module that imports classes and variables from a local package '.base' and exposes them through __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing symbols from '.base' module",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or security-critical operations",
  "flows": "Imported symbols are re-exported, but no data flow from untrusted sources is evident",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing symbols from a relative module and exposing them via __all__. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or external data interactions are present. It is likely part of a package's internal structure meant to organize exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard module import/export pattern with no suspicious activity.",
