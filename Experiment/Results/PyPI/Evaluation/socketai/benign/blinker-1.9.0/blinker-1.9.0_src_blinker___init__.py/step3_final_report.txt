  "purpose": "Re-exporting symbols from the local 'base' module for package organization and accessibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .base module: ANY, default_namespace, NamedSignal, Namespace, Signal, signal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external communication, or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import from .base → re-export via __all__; no data flow beyond module scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import/export pattern, no obfuscation, no dynamic code, no secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports specific symbols from a local module and re-exports them. It uses __future__ import for annotations, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module re-export pattern with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
