  "purpose": "Test the Symbol class for identity, equality, representation, and pickling behavior in a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Creation of Symbol instances within the test functions, pickle.dumps and pickle.loads for serialization/deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Pickle functions acting on internal objects; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Symbol object creation -> pickling -> unpickling -> assertions on object identity/equality.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; pickle used safely on trusted objects in a test context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward tests on the Symbol class, verifying properties and serialization. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. Pickle is used only on internally created objects, which is standard in testing. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of pickle in this context does not pose a security risk, given the controlled environment. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and conservative. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and controlled nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The use of pickle is safe here, and the code's purpose is solely to test Symbol's properties. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
