  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core security implications, correctness, and the consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code tests Symbol's identity, equality, representation, and pickling. No external inputs or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minimal, likely due to the use of pickle, but in a controlled environment, this is acceptable.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues found. The low security risk score is appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on internal creation and no external data. No malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified; no external data or risky operations.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The test is safe and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the potential risk of pickle with untrusted data. Here, data is controlled, so no actual risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — the report notes the potential risk of pickle, but clarifies it's safe in this context.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning recognizes pickle's inherent risk but correctly states that in this controlled scenario, the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the safety of the test environment.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — consistent with the understanding that pickle can be risky, but not here.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid reasoning; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the behavior of Symbol, with no external inputs or malicious actions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, possibly due to the mention of pickle, but still within safe bounds given the context.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe, and the risk score reflects the inherent danger of pickle in untrusted contexts, which is not present here.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1 or 0.2) mainly due to the use of pickle, which is acceptable in controlled testing environments.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, related to pickle usage, but justified given the context.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious. No significant security issues are present.",
