  "conclusion": "This code is benign, intended solely for testing the 'blinker' Signal class. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight elevation in risk score (0.1) in report 5 is justified by the focus on exception handling but does not indicate any real security concern."
