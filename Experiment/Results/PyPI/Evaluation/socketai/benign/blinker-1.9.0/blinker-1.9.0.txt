The main security concern is the trustworthiness of user-defined receivers, which is typical for callback-based event systems. The overall supply chain security risk is very low, and the scores assigned by the reports are appropriate."

The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The reports accurately reflect the benign nature of the code. No modifications or warnings are necessary."

The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight elevation in risk score (0.1) in report 5 is justified by the focus on exception handling but does not indicate any real security concern."
