  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score should remain at 0. Slightly increasing the overall security risk to around 0.2-0.25 is justified to account for potential hidden risks in incomplete contexts, but current scores are acceptable."
