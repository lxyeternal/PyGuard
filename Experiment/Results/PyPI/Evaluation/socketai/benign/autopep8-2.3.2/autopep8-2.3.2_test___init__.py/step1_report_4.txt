{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, local variables, or environment variables (if any). No external data sources are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to standard output, files, or network connections. No suspicious sinks like external servers or sensitive data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to outputs; no evidence of malicious source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with typical Python syntax. No suspicious patterns, unsafe code practices, or malicious behavior are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries is standard; no signs of malicious library behavior. No indicators of code injection, data leakage, or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. The overall security risk is low.",
