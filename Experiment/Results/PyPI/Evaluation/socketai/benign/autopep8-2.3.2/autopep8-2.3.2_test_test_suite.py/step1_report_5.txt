{
  "purpose": "This script runs autopep8 to format Python files and compares the output against expected results for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input filenames, expected output filenames, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes formatted code and discrepancy reports to files and standard output.",
  "flows": "Input filenames and aggressive option are used to generate formatted code; discrepancies are written to output files; test results are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution or external network communication observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages file I/O, command-line argument parsing, and calls to the autopep8 library for code formatting and comparison. No untrusted data is used insecurely; all operations are confined to file handling and process flow control. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or harmful actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate testing utility for autopep8 formatting correctness. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code.",
