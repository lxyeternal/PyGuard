{
  "purpose": "This script runs the autopep8 formatter on test files and compares the output against expected results for code style compliance.",
  "sources": "Reads filenames, command-line arguments, and file contents for comparison.",
  "sinks": "Uses autopep8's fix_file and open_with_encoding functions to process files; no untrusted data execution or external network actions detected.",
  "flows": "Input filenames and options are read, processed by autopep8 functions, and output is written to files or printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Usage of autopep8 functions appears standard and safe; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages file I/O operations, command-line argument parsing, and invoking the autopep8 library for formatting Python code. It reads expected output files, compares them with generated output, and reports mismatches. No external network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic appears typical for a testing utility, with standard safe practices for file handling and output formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe, non-malicious task of running and validating code style formatting using autopep8. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. It is a typical testing harness for a code formatting tool.",
