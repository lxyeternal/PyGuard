  "conclusion": "The code is a typical user management module with no signs of malware or sabotage. The primary concern is the insecure password hashing method and missing protections against brute-force attacks, which moderately increase the security risk. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. Addressing the password hashing approach and adding rate limiting/CAPTCHA would significantly improve security."
