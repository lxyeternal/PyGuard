{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a collection of functions, print statements, and syntax examples, possibly for educational or testing purposes. It does not implement any functional logic beyond output and syntax demonstration.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os; code reads from standard input (via print statements); no external data sources; internal variables used only locally.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no network or file operations; no use of external data in a malicious way.",
  "flows": "No flow from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues; mainly isolated function definitions and print statements.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of syntax errors such as '1 /1' and '1 *2' outside functions, use of outdated raise syntax (e.g., 'raise ValueError, 'msg''), inconsistent indentation, and commented lines indicating potential code snippets or test cases. No actual malicious code or backdoors identified. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of simple print statements, function definitions, and syntax examples. There are no operations involving external data, network communication, or sensitive data handling. The 'raise' statements use outdated syntax but are benign and do not execute malicious actions. The syntax errors like '1 /1' outside functions suggest non-executable or placeholder code. No evidence of malware, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears to be a non-functional, educational, or testing script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a collection of syntax demonstrations and function definitions with no harmful operations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security threats were found.",
