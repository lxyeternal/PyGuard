  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths are observable",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only an encoding declaration, which is standard and harmless; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a coding declaration specifying the character encoding (iso-8859-1). There are no functional or executable elements, imports, functions, or data manipulations present. This is a benign statement used for defining source code encoding and does not indicate any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign encoding declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not perform any operations that could be harmful or suspicious.",
