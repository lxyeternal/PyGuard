  "purpose": "The code declares the file encoding as iso-8859-1 but contains no executable or functional content.",
  "sources": "The source is the file header specifying encoding; no data input operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution paths in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a single encoding declaration comment, which is unusual if not part of a larger file; no other code or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only sets the source code encoding and does not include any executable statements, data handling, or third-party library usage. Its minimal nature suggests it's part of a larger file. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security issues are detectable from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains only a file encoding declaration with no executable or malicious content. It poses no security risks on its own.",
