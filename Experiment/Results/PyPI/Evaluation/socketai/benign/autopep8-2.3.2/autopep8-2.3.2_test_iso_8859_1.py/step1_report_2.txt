  "purpose": "No specific purpose is indicated; the code only specifies an encoding declaration.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed, as the code contains only a coding declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only an encoding declaration without any functional code; the encoding declaration itself is benign but unusual if no other code follows.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single encoding declaration comment, specifying 'iso-8859-1' as the source code encoding. There are no functions, variables, data inputs, outputs, or executable code present. This minimal content provides no malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The encoding declaration is harmless and often used to specify character encoding for the file. Since no code exists beyond this comment, there's no apparent source, sink, flow, or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is only a charset declaration with no executable or functional code present. It poses no security threat, no malware, and no suspicious behavior.",
