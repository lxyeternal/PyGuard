{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a file encoding declaration, indicating that the source code is encoded using ISO-8859-1.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the file itself, specifically the encoding declaration at the top of the file.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it contains only an encoding declaration, which does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists beyond the static encoding declaration statement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only an encoding declaration without additional code; no suspicious or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a coding declaration comment specifying ISO-8859-1 encoding. No executable code, input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. This is a minimal, standard comment line used for specifying file encoding and does not involve any behavior or logic. As such, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is only an encoding declaration and does not contain any executable logic or malicious behavior. It does not pose any security threat.",
