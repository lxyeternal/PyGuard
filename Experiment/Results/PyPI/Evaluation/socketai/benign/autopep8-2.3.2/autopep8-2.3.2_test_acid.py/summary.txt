  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign testing utility for autopep8 with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate due to subprocess execution with filenames that could be untrusted, which is typical for such tools. Overall, it is safe and intended for legitimate code quality assurance."
