{
  "purpose": "A testing utility for autopep8 that runs formatting checks on Python files, verifies syntax, and optionally compares bytecode to ensure formatting stability.",
  "sources": "Reads input files via filenames, directory traversal, and command-line arguments; executes external commands (autopep8, pycodestyle) via subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to external formatting and style-checking tools; no untrusted data sinks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Source files are passed to subprocess commands; syntax validation via compile(); flow is controlled and predictable.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a legitimate testing harness for code formatting tools, executing external commands, performing syntax validation, and directory traversal. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. Subprocess calls are standard for such utilities and do not indicate malicious intent. The code's structure and purpose are transparent and aligned with its functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign testing utility for autopep8 with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) is appropriate due to subprocess execution with filenames that could be untrusted, which is typical for such tools. Overall, it is safe and intended for legitimate code quality assurance.",
