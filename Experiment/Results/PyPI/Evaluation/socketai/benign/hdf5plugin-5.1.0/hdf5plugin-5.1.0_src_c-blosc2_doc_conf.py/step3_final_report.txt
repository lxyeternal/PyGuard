  "purpose": "Execute 'doxygen Doxyfile' to generate documentation, as part of the build process.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run call executing the command 'doxygen Doxyfile'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call potentially executes external commands; no data leaks or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "flows": "Static command execution without external input; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of shell=True with a hardcoded command; no obfuscation or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code runs a static command via subprocess with shell=True, which can be risky if external input influences the command. However, since the command is hardcoded and not influenced by user input, the security risk is minimal. No malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks are detected. The subprocess call is standard for build automation, and the rest of the configuration is typical. The use of shell=True is generally discouraged but acceptable here due to the static nature of the command. The overall security risk is very low, and no malware or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script executing a static command with minimal security concern. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The use of shell=True is a minor concern but does not elevate risk in this context.",
