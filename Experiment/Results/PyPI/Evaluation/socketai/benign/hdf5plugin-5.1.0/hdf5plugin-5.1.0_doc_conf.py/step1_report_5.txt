  "sources": "Configuration comments and variable assignments, particularly in the 'extensions' list and 'html_theme' setting.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input processing or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration data appears static and benign.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file. It contains commented instructions, imports, and variable assignments for setting up documentation. The 'extensions' list includes common Sphinx extensions and themes, and the code uses static strings for project info and theme selection. There are no inputs, external data reads, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical, benign Sphinx configuration file with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
