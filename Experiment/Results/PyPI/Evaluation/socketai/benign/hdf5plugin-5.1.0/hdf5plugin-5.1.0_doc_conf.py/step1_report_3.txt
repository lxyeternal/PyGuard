  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as this is a static configuration file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is standard for a Sphinx configuration file with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration file for Sphinx, setting up project information, extensions, ignore patterns, and HTML options. It contains only comments and variable assignments related to documentation build setup. There are no dynamic executions, external data reads, or network activities. The code appears standard and does not include any obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical static configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. The code is safe and not indicative of supply chain attacks or malware.",
