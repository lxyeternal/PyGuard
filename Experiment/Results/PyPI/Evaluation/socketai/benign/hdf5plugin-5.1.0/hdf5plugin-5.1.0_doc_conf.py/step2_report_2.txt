  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static, standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation.\n- No dynamic code, external data handling, or user input processing is identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be typical setup code for documentation purposes, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code or malware:** None of the reports identify any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** Since it's a static configuration file with no external data handling, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, non-obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified because there's no indication of security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical static configuration file for Sphinx.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or external data handling, it poses no security threat. The provided scores are accurate, and no adjustments are needed.",
