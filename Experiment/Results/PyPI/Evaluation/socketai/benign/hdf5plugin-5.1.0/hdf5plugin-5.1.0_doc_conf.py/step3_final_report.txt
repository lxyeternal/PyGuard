  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation builder, setting project info, extensions, ignore patterns, and HTML theme.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static variable assignments and comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-formed configuration file for Sphinx, containing no dynamic code, external data handling, or executable logic. It includes only comments, variable assignments, and lists of extensions and patterns. No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. All extensions are common, and the configuration is typical for documentation setup. No network activity, file manipulations, or user inputs are involved. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple consistent reports, which assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of zero. The code poses no security threat, and the analysis aligns with the scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static Sphinx configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and security risk: 0 are accurate and justified.",
