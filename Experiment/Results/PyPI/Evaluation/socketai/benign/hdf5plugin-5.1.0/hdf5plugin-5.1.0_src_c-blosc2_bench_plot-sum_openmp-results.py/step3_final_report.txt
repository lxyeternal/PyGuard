{
  "purpose": "The code generates a bar chart visualizing compression speeds of various algorithms across different thread counts using static, hardcoded data.",
  "sources": "Static data arrays defined within the script for compression speeds; no external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external communication, or data leaks; visualization output only.",
  "flows": "Data is read from static arrays and passed directly to plotting functions; no external data flows or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors; straightforward and static implementation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, defines static datasets, converts units, and produces a plot. It contains no external data input, network activity, or system modifications. The code is simple, with no obfuscation or malicious logic. All signals indicate benign behavior, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 being appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data visualization script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
