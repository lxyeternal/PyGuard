{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to plot a bar chart comparing data compression speeds of various algorithms across different thread counts.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from predefined lists for compression speeds and labels, and it uses matplotlib to generate a plot.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or output untrusted data; it only visualizes predefined datasets.",
  "flows": "N/A — no flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; the data are static arrays used solely for plotting.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The data and labels are hardcoded but appear to be benign, related to benchmarking data.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, defines static numerical data, converts units, and produces a bar plot with labels and a legend. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or data processing beyond static data visualization. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and solely focused on plotting benchmarking data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data visualization script with no indications of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It solely plots predefined data without any data leakage, network activity, or suspicious logic.",
