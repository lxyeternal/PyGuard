{
  "purpose": "The code generates a bar chart comparing compression speeds of various algorithms across different thread counts.",
  "sources": "Data is hardcoded within the script; no external inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs a plot via matplotlib, which does not involve untrusted data or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from hardcoded lists, converted to numpy arrays, and visualized in a plot; no untrusted source-to-sink flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded data appears to be static, and no suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries (matplotlib and numpy) and uses them to generate a static visualization. All data is hardcoded; no user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. There are no suspicious functions, code injections, or obfuscated segments. The code performs straightforward data visualization with no network or system modifications, no credential handling, and no malicious activities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data visualization script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It solely visualizes predefined data and does not interact with untrusted sources or perform any harmful operations.",
