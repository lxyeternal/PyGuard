{
  "purpose": "The code generates a bar chart visualizing compression speeds across different threading configurations for various compression algorithms.",
  "sources": "Data arrays defined within the code (uncompressed and compressed speeds), labels for x-axis",
  "sinks": "The code generates a plot but does not output or transmit data externally or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data arrays feed into plotting functions to produce a visualization; no external data flows or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears straightforward for data visualization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard plotting libraries (matplotlib, numpy), defines static numerical data arrays representing compression performance metrics, converts data to GB/s, and plots bar charts with appropriate labels and legends. The code contains no input handling, network activity, or external data processing. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data visualization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply plots predefined data without any external dependencies or data leaks.",
