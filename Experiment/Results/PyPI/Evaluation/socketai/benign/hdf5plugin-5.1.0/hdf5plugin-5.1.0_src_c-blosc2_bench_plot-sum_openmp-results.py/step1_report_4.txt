{
  "purpose": "The code generates a bar chart visualizing compression speed data for different algorithms across multiple thread counts.",
  "sources": "Imports matplotlib.pyplot and numpy libraries; uses hardcoded data arrays for visualization.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data processing involved.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; data is statically defined and used solely for plotting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard visualization libraries, defines static numerical data for plotting, converts data to GB/s units, and creates a bar chart with labels and legends. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leakage, or malicious activities. The code appears straightforward and intended solely for data visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data visualization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on hardcoded data for generating a plot, with no indicators of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
