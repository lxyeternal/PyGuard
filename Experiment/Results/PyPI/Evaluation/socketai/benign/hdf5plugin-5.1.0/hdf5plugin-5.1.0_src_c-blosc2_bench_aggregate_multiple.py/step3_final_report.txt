  "purpose": "This script executes a user-specified command multiple times, captures numerical output, and aggregates the results by replacing placeholders in the original output with the minimum values across runs.",
  "sources": "The command string provided via the '--command' argument, read directly from user input; subprocess.run executes this command.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call executes external commands based on user input, which could lead to command injection if input is malicious.",
  "flows": "User input -> '--command' argument -> run_command() -> subprocess.run with shell=True -> command execution; output parsing -> regex extraction -> string substitution with ReplaceNumbers -> printed output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run with shell=True on user-controlled input without sanitization; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs repeated execution of external commands, parsing numerical output via regex, and replacing placeholders with aggregated (minimum) values. The main security concern is the use of subprocess.run with shell=True on unvalidated input, which can lead to command injection. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and intended for benchmarking purposes. The risk is primarily due to command injection potential, not malicious intent. Scores reflect this: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk approximately 0.3-0.4.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign benchmarking utility with a notable security concern related to executing user-supplied commands via subprocess with shell=True. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main risk stems from potential command injection if inputs are not sanitized. Overall, it is safe in intent but should be used with caution regarding input validation.",
