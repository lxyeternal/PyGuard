  "purpose": "A data parsing and plotting utility for benchmark results, reading input files, extracting performance metrics, and visualizing them.",
  "sources": "Input file lines starting with '-->', 'memcpy(write):', 'memcpy(read):', 'comp(write):', 'decomp(read):'",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems, execute commands, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> parsing logic -> data structures -> plotting functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on user-supplied input for options.limit, which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The script reads benchmark output files, extracts performance metrics, and plots them. The main security concern is the use of eval() on options.limit, which could execute malicious code if input is crafted maliciously. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, consistent with the benign nature. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects the eval() usage, which is a known vulnerability but not malicious. Replacing eval() with safer alternatives would mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign visualization utility with a minor security concern due to eval(). No malware or malicious activity detected. The scores are justified; malware score 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.",
