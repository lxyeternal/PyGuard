  "purpose": "The script extracts a 150x150 grid of precipitation data from a local GRIB file, converts it to float32, compresses it with blosc, and writes it to disk.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the local file 'TOT_PRECIP.2D.201512.grb' using GDAL's GetRasterBand and ReadAsArray.",
  "sinks": "Writes compressed binary data to 'rainfall-band-150x150.bin' via file write after compression.",
  "flows": "Source: local file read -> data loaded into numpy array -> compressed with blosc -> written to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution; straightforward data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (gdal, numpy, blosc) for geospatial data extraction and compression. It reads a specific region from a local dataset, converts data types, compresses, and saves. No network activity, no obfuscation, no malicious payloads are present. The purpose aligns with legitimate data handling. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence scores are high, reflecting the straightforward analysis. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign data extraction and compression script with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The security risk and malware scores are correctly set to zero, and obfuscation is absent. The overall assessment confirms no security concerns.",
