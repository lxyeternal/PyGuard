  "purpose": "Extract a small grid of precipitation data from a GRIB file, process it, and save it in a compressed binary format.",
  "sources": "File read operation with gdal.Open to load 'TOT_PRECIP.2D.201512.grb'; reading raster data via band.ReadAsArray.",
  "sinks": "Writing compressed data to 'rainfall-band-150x150.bin' via open().write().",
  "flows": "Data read from the dataset and raster band → processed into numpy array → compressed with blosc → written to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code. Usage of well-known libraries (gdal, numpy, blosc).",
  "analysis": "The script loads a precipitation dataset using gdal, extracts a specific 150x150 grid, converts it to float32, compresses it with blosc at high compression level, and saves the output. All operations are straightforward data processing steps without any suspicious or malicious code. No user input, environment variables, or external command execution are present. The libraries used are standard and reputable for geospatial data processing. No anomalous or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign data extraction and compression task without signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries for geospatial data handling and compression, with no suspicious network or backdoor activity.",
