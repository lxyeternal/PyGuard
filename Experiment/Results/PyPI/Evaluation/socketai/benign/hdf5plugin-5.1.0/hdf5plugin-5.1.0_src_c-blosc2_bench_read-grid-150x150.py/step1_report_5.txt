{
  "purpose": "Extracts a small precipitation grid from a downloaded file, compresses it, and saves it to disk.",
  "sources": "Reads a specific raster file ('TOT_PRECIP.2D.201512.grb') using GDAL, and reads data from it.",
  "sinks": "Writes compressed data to 'rainfall-band-150x150.bin'.",
  "flows": "Data is read from the raster file, converted to a NumPy array, compressed with blosc, then written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of well-known libraries (GDAL, NumPy, blosc) is normal. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a raster dataset using GDAL, extracts a 150x150 data block, converts it to float32, compresses it with blosc at maximum compression level, and writes the compressed data to a binary file. All operations appear standard for geospatial data processing. No malicious payloads, network connections, or suspicious activities are evident. The dataset source is a public meteorological dataset, and the code only processes and stores the data locally.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a straightforward data extraction, compression, and storage task without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate geospatial data processing script.",
