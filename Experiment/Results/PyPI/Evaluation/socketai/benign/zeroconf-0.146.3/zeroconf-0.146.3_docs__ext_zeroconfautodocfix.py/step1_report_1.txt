{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the behavior of Sphinx's autodoc extension to control which members are skipped during documentation generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from the Sphinx application object and object attributes such as __doc__, __private__, and __func__.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or output data to external systems; it only influences documentation generation behavior within the application.",
  "flows": "The function 'skip_member' evaluates object attributes during autodoc processing to determine whether to skip members, influencing the documentation build process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated constructs, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs straightforward conditional checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hook for Sphinx to determine which class or function members to skip during autodoc. It inspects attributes such as __doc__, __private__, and __func__, and uses the 'skip' parameter. The logic is simple and intended for documentation purposes. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious activities are evident. The code is standard for Sphinx customization.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard customization script for Sphinx documentation generation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
