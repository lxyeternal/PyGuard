  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code customizes Sphinx's autodoc extension.\n- It defines a `skip_member` function that skips members if:\n  - `skip` is already True, or\n  - `__doc__` attribute is None, or\n  - `__private__` attribute is True, or\n  - `__func__` attribute has `__private__` True.\n- It connects this function to the `autodoc-skip-member` event.\n\n**Security Perspective:**\n- The code only reads object attributes and influences documentation generation.\n- It does not perform external network calls, write to files, or handle untrusted data.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The purpose is purely to improve documentation clarity by skipping private or undocumented members.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for documentation customization.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0.\n- The purpose and flow are consistent, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities present.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the reliance on `__private__` attribute, which is not a standard Python attribute but likely a convention used by the codebase. This is not inherently risky, but if misused, could cause some private members to be skipped unintentionally. However, this is a documentation concern, not a security one.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard customization for Sphinx documentation. It does not pose security risks or contain malicious behavior.\n\n**Note:** I confirm that the code is safe, with no security issues or malware.",
