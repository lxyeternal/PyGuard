  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a Sphinx extension hook to control which members are skipped during autodoc.\n- It checks for attributes: `__doc__`, `__private__`, and `__func__` (specifically `__func__.__private__`).\n- It skips members if:\n  - `skip` is already True,\n  - `__doc__` is None,\n  - `__private__` attribute is True on the object,\n  - `__private__` attribute is True on the object's `__func__` (if exists).\n\n**Security Perspective:**\n- The code performs straightforward attribute checks.\n- No external data handling, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- It only influences documentation generation behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present\n- The code is standard for customizing Sphinx autodoc behavior.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious code are evident.\n- The logic is simple and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Analyzing the reports:\n- All five reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for documentation customization.\n- They assign:\n  - Malware score: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Critical review of scores:\n- The reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Malware score is 0, matching the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Confidence scores are 1, which seems justified.\n\n### Are any scores unreasonable?\n- No, the scores align well with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe customization for Sphinx.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and poses no security concern.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate.\n- No issues, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current low-risk assessment.",
