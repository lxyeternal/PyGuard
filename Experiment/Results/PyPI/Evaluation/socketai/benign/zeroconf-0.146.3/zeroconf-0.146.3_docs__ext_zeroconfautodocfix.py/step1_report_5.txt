{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the behavior of the Sphinx autodoc extension to skip certain members during documentation generation, specifically filtering out private and undocumented objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads attributes of objects (e.g., __doc__, __private__, __func__) and the 'app' object for connecting the skip_member function to Sphinx's autodoc-skip-member event.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "The code uses attribute checks on objects and connects a callback to a Sphinx event to influence documentation behavior; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and pertains to documentation customization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Sphinx application class, defines a function to determine whether to skip members based on attributes such as __doc__ and __private__, then connects this function to the Sphinx autodoc event. The logic is standard for customizing documentation generation. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The code is benign and intended for documentation customization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign customization script for Sphinx documentation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply filters out private and undocumented members from the generated documentation.",
