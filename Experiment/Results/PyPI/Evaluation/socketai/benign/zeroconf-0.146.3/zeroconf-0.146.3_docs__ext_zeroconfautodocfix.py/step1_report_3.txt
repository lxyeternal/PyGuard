{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the Sphinx autodoc extension to skip certain members during documentation generation based on specific attributes, likely to improve documentation clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from the Sphinx application object and attributes of objects being documented (__doc__, __private__, __func__).",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write untrusted data or interact with external systems; it primarily influences documentation behavior within the Sphinx process.",
  "flows": "The setup function connects the skip_member function to the 'autodoc-skip-member' event, which is called during documentation processing to decide whether to skip members based on their attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The functions perform straightforward attribute checks and configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Sphinx, defines a function to determine whether to skip documented members based on certain attributes (e.g., __private__). It then registers this function as a callback for autodoc skip logic. All operations are within standard documentation configuration and attribute checks. No data leaks, external communications, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears purely for documentation customization without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a customization for Sphinx documentation generation to skip private members. There are no malicious behaviors, no external data handling, and no security risks present.",
