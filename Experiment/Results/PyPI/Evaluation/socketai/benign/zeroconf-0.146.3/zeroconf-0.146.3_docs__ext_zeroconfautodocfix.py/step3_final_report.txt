{
  "purpose": "The code customizes Sphinx's autodoc extension to skip certain members during documentation generation based on attributes like __doc__, __private__, and __func__.",
  "sources": "The code reads attributes __doc__, __private__, and __func__ from objects being documented.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or security effects; the code does not handle external data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking object attributes (__doc__, __private__, __func__) to decide whether to skip members during autodoc processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs attribute checks without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx extension hook that influences documentation behavior by skipping private or undocumented members. It only reads object attributes and makes decisions based on them. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is simple and intended solely for documentation customization. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard customization for Sphinx documentation generation, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
