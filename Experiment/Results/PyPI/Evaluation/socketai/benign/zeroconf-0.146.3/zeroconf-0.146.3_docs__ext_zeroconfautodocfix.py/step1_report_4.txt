{
  "purpose": "To modify the behavior of the Sphinx autodoc extension by controlling which members are skipped during documentation generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'app' object and inspects objects' attributes (__doc__, __private__, __func__).",
  "sinks": "The code influences the autodoc process, affecting how documentation is generated and which members are included or excluded.",
  "flows": "Input from 'app' triggers the 'skip_member' function, which inspects object attributes to determine whether to skip members during documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and serves a clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to decide whether to skip members in Sphinx autodoc based on attributes like __doc__, __private__, and __func__.__private__. It then connects this function to the autodoc-skip-member event. No external data sources, user input, or network activity is involved. The logic is simple and intended for documentation customization. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign customization of Sphinx autodoc behavior to control member skipping based on specific attributes. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
