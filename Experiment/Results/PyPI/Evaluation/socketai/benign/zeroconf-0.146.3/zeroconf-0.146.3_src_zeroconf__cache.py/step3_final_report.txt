  "purpose": "A DNS cache management system for multicast DNS service discovery, handling record storage, expiration, and retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads DNS records, current time, and cache lookups within in-memory data structures.",
  "sinks": "Internal cache updates; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Records are added to cache, expiration times are scheduled, and expired records are removed; retrieval functions access cache entries based on keys and details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard DNS cache with expiration handling, record addition/removal, and retrieval functions. It uses in-place mutation of DNS record objects for TTL updates, which is typical for cache implementations. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The cache management logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage. The low security risk score reflects the inherent minimal risks of cache mutation but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured DNS cache management module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It performs standard cache operations without external communication or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, consistent with minimal inherent risks.",
