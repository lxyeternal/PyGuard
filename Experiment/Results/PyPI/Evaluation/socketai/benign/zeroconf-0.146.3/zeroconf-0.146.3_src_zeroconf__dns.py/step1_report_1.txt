  "purpose": "Implementation of DNS Service Discovery (mDNS) records and related data structures for use in multicast DNS.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (enum, socket, typing), internal modules (_exceptions, _utils.net, _utils.time, const). No external input sources or user data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "Methods that write data to DNSOutgoing objects (write, write_string, write_name, write_character_string, write_short, _write_byte). No direct use of untrusted data for critical operations such as system commands or network connections. No apparent data leaks or external system effects.",
  "flows": "Code constructs DNS record objects from parameters, possibly serializes them into network packets via write methods, but no untrusted external data sources or dangerous data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code is primarily data structure and serialization logic for DNS records. No obfuscated language features, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names. No network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured representation of various DNS record types with methods for equality, hashing, and serialization. It uses current_time_millis() for timestamps and relies on proper data handling within class methods. No external inputs are read directly, and no network or system effects are performed within these classes. The data handling appears standard and well-encapsulated. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware-like behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of DNS record data structures for mDNS purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It focuses on data modeling and serialization without external data or system modifications. No security risks or malicious activity are detected.",
