  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected; standard configuration usage",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file, importing standard modules, appending to sys.path, setting up project info, and defining HTML and extension options. It attempts to import zeroconf to retrieve version info, which is benign. No external network communications, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. No obfuscation or unusual code structures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
