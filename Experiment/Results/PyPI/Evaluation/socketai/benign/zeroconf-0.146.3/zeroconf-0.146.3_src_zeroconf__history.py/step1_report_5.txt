{
  "purpose": "Implement a DNS Question History management system to prevent duplicate multicast DNS questions within a specific interval.",
  "sources": "Input data is the DNSQuestion and DNSRecord objects, which are used as keys and values in internal dictionaries; data is added via add_question_at_time and checked via suppresses.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no output or external data transmission based on input data is performed.",
  "flows": "Input questions and known answers are stored and retrieved within the internal _history dictionary; suppression logic checks for recent identical questions to avoid re-asking within a time interval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward, managing internal data structures without external side effects or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code manages a question history for multicast DNS queries, preventing repeated questions within a certain time frame. It uses standard data structures and adheres to RFC guidelines. No external network communication, credential handling, or obfuscated code is present. The logic is transparent, with clear add, check, expire, and clear functions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a DNS query management system. There are no indications of malicious intent, malicious data exfiltration, or sabotage activities.",
