{
  "purpose": "Manage DNS question history to prevent duplicate queries within a specific interval, aligning with RFC 6762.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures: self._history dictionary, question and answer sets, timestamps.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal data structures only.",
  "flows": "Questions are added with timestamps; suppression checks compare current time with stored timestamps and answer sets.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward management of internal state without external influence or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a DNS question history class with methods to add questions, suppress duplicates based on timing and known answers, expire old entries, and clear history. It uses standard data structures and logic consistent with RFC 6762. No network operations, external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to internal state management, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard DNS question history management module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal security risk score (0.1 in one report) is acceptable given the context. Overall, the dependency appears safe and appropriate for supply chain security.",
