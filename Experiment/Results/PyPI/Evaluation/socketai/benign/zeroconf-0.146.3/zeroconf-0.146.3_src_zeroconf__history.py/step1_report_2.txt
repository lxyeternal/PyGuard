{
  "purpose": "Provides a framework for DNS Service Discovery using IP multicast, including question history management for duplicate suppression.",
  "sources": "Initialization of question history, adding questions with timestamps and known answers, expiration of old questions, clearing history.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data directly affects system or data leak points; no external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Questions are added with timestamps and known answers, then suppressed or expired based on timing and answer set differences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The module performs standard DNS question tracking. No obfuscated code or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a DNS question history management class with methods to add questions, suppress duplicate questions, expire old questions, and clear history. It relies on timestamps and known answer sets for suppression logic, adhering to RFC 6762 standards. No suspicious or malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or security risks are present. Usage of internal data structures and standard library features indicates typical functionality for DNS query tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of DNS question history management for multicast DNS service discovery. No malicious intent, no malware behavior, and no security risks are identified.",
