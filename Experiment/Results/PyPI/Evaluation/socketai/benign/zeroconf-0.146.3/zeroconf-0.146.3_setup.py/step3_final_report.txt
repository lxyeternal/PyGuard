  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the zeroconf Python library.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input or external data sources; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external communications; only package configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The import statement 'from build_ext import *' is unconventional in setup scripts but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and build instructions. The only unusual element is the wildcard import from 'build_ext', which may be part of custom build extensions but warrants verification. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and standard for Python package configuration. The import of 'build_ext' should be verified to ensure integrity, but no malicious intent or malicious code is detected.",
