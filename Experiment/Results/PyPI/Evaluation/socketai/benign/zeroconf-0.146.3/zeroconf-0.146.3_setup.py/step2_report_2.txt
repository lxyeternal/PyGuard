  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a package setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard import statements.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the setup purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the unusual 'from build_ext import *' statement, which is common in build scripts but somewhat unconventional.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior; considers the import unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The 'from build_ext import *' is not inherently malicious; it’s a common pattern in some build scripts. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the setup process.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Similar to previous, mentions 'from build_ext import *' as somewhat unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately concludes no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The slight increase in securityRisk (0.1) may reflect the unusual import, but overall, no malicious activity. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights 'from build_ext import *' as unusual and potential vector if compromised, but no evidence.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes that this line warrants further verification but isn't malicious on its own.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score is justified given the unusual import. The malware score remains zero, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard setup script.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard package setup script.\n- The only slightly unusual element is the 'from build_ext import *' line, which appears in multiple reports. While unconventional, it is not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly elevated due to the unconventional import, but overall very low risk.\n\n**Justification:** The code is a typical setup script with no suspicious behaviors. The only point of concern is the import statement, which warrants verification but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The overall security posture of this code is benign. The scores should remain very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated at 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1).",
