  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for a multicast DNS (mDNS/ZeroConf) library.\n- The code is straightforward, consisting solely of class definitions with descriptive docstrings.\n- No input/output handling, data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The confidence level is high (1) across all reports, indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports `__future__.annotations`, but does not utilize it in any dynamic or obfuscated way; this is standard practice for forward references.\n- Exception classes are typical for error handling in a library, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Risk and malware scores:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code appears to be a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n- There are no indications of supply chain compromise, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very low risk, mainly because this is a small, static code snippet with no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Final note:**\nSince the code is purely structural, defining exception classes, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident, I agree with the provided assessments. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.",
