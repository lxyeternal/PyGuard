{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for a multicast DNS service discovery library, providing error handling and descriptive errors for various failure scenarios.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, output, or external communications are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving sources and sinks, as this code only contains class definitions for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, defining exception classes with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely focused on defining exception classes for error handling in a multicast DNS service discovery module. It imports a future feature, 'annotations,' but does not use dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or malicious constructs. No external input handling, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a DNS service discovery library. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its structure and content are typical for such a purpose.",
