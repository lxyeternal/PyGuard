{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of custom exception classes for a multicast DNS (mDNS/ZeroConf) service discovery library, serving as error handling infrastructure.",
  "sources": "The code imports __future__.annotations, but does not process input, read data, or handle external sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, external data flows, or untrusted data processing present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares exception classes without runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the import of annotations is harmless and unused.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions, with no dynamic features, network activity, or data handling. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. The code's purpose is purely to provide error handling within a larger framework. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for a DNS service discovery library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
