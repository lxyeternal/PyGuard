  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a multicast DNS Service Discovery library in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports future annotations; no external data inputs are processed in this code snippet.",
  "targets": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks, as the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of standard exception class definitions with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes for error handling within a DNS Service Discovery library. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions beyond standard Python exception definitions. The code appears straightforward and does not include any malicious or obfuscated code, nor does it perform any data processing or network activity. It is purely structural, intended for error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
