  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in a zeroconf/multicast DNS service discovery framework.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data or untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet as it only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to zeroconf operations. There are no external data inputs, outputs, or processing logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception class definitions supporting a larger framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of custom exception definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
