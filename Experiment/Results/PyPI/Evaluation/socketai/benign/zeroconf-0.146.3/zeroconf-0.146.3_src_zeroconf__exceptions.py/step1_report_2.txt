{
  "purpose": "This module provides a framework for DNS Service Discovery (ZeroConf/mDNS) using IP multicast, primarily to facilitate network service discovery.",
  "sources": "Imports the __future__ annotations feature; defines exception classes, which are not input sources.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks are present; the code only defines classes and exceptions without processing input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The provided code only defines exception classes for a DNS Service Discovery framework. There is no data processing, user input handling, network communication, or other operations that could be exploited maliciously. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no external data flows are evident. The code appears to be standard, harmless class definitions for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for a DNS Service Discovery library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this snippet. It appears safe and typical for a Python module defining custom exceptions.",
