  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code only defines a set of custom exception classes for a multicast DNS (mDNS/ZeroConf) service discovery library.\n   - It imports `from __future__ import annotations` but does not utilize dynamic features or complex logic.\n   - No data processing, network communication, or external input handling is present.\n   - The purpose is purely to provide structured error handling within the larger framework.\n\n2. **Assessment of Potential Malicious Behavior:**\n   - There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - The code is straightforward, standard for exception class definitions.\n   - No external data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The import of `annotations` is harmless and unused, which is common in modern Python code for type hinting.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports confirm that the code is only defining exception classes with descriptive docstrings.\n   - They emphasize the absence of data flows, input/output handling, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent: the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there are no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The code does not contain any logic that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n   - The only minor note is the import of `annotations`, which is harmless here.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 0               | 0                  | 0          |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat. The reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
