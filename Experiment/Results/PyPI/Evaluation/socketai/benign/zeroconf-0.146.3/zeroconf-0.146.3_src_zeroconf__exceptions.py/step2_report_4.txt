  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes for a multicast DNS (mDNS/ZeroConf) service discovery library.\n   - It imports `from __future__ import annotations`, which is standard for forward references and type hinting improvements.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, and do not include any executable logic, data processing, network operations, or external input handling.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is purely defining exception classes with no input/output, data handling, or network activity.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and free of anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - The analysis in each report is aligned with the code content: no malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code shows no malicious intent or behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low, which makes sense because the code is only defining exception classes without any operational logic that could introduce security issues.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - The only consideration is whether the exception classes are used elsewhere maliciously or if this code is part of a larger, compromised package.\n   - However, based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain risk.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or the analysis.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code appears to be a normal, harmless part of a larger library for DNS service discovery, serving solely as error handling infrastructure.",
