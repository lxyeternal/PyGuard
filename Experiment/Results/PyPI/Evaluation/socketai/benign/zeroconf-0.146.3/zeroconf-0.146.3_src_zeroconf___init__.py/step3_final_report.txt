  "purpose": "Module initialization and API exposure for DNS Service Discovery library in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, license and author metadata, version info, and __all__ exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; code is static setup.",
  "flows": "Imports and metadata setup without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__ or main module file containing license info, author metadata, version, and a comprehensive list of imports from internal submodules related to DNS records, network utilities, exceptions, and service management. There are no functions, network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for an open-source Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for a DNS Service Discovery library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent with a static package initializer. No adjustments are necessary.",
