  "purpose": "Build optional Cython modules for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('SKIP_CYTHON', 'REQUIRE_CYTHON'), source file paths, and imports build tools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; environment variables influence build flow but are standard.",
  "flows": "Environment variables control whether cythonize is invoked; source files are processed into extensions.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard build script with exception handling and environment variable checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build utility for optional Cython modules, using standard modules and practices. It reads environment variables to decide whether to build cython extensions, handles exceptions gracefully, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious code. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or data leaks are present. The environment variables are used for build control, which is common and not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard build utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal risk score reflects the potential for environment variable manipulation, which is typical in build environments but does not indicate malicious intent.",
