{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various JWT-related errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, storage, or transmission occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the classes are simply data structures for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly defines exception classes with standard init methods.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception for JWT errors, with consistent structure. There are no external inputs, data processing, or any suspicious code. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or malicious code are present. The purpose is to facilitate error handling, not to perform any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, purposefully designed for structured error handling related to JWT authentication. There is no malicious behavior or security risks evident within this code fragment.",
