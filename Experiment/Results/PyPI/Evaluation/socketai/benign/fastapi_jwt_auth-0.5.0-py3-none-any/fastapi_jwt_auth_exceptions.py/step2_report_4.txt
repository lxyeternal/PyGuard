  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code.**  \nAll reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for JWT errors in a FastAPI app. The code indeed consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with __init__ methods setting status_code and message. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.  \n**Conclusion:** The reports' observations are accurate; the code matches their descriptions.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning.**  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is standard, benign, and purely definitional. They do not identify any errors or security flaws. This is consistent with the code's straightforward nature.  \n**Conclusion:** No logical errors or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue.**  \nAll reports assign:\n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0  \n- confidence: 1.0 (or 1)  \n\nThese are reasonable given the code's benign nature. The consistent high confidence and zero malware/obfuscation scores align with the code's simplicity.  \n**Suggestion:** No change needed; scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk scores higher than 0.5.**  \nSince all reports assign a securityRisk of 0, and the code is straightforward exception class definitions, this is justified. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or risky constructs.  \n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n**Step 5: Examine the malware score.**  \nAll reports correctly assign malware: 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities.**  \nThe reports are cautious, stating the code is standard and benign. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly notes the absence of suspicious or malicious code.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency of scores with the report.**  \nScores are consistent with the code's nature: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \nGiven the code's simplicity, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is standard exception class definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
