  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various JWT-related errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions; no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling of untrusted input occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions extending a base exception. Each class has an initializer that sets error details such as status code and message. There is no input processing, data handling, network communication, or other potentially malicious activity. The structure and syntax are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing custom exceptions for JWT errors without any malicious intent or security risk. It is standard and safe.",
