  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JWT-related errors in a FastAPI application, facilitating structured error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions only store status_code and message parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; purely definitional classes.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with status_code and message, used in error handling pathways within the application.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each initialized with status_code and message. It is purely definitional, with no dynamic code, external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The classes serve as structured error representations for JWT errors in a FastAPI context. The code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious patterns or security risks. The exception classes do not call super().__init__(), which is a stylistic choice but does not impact security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for structured error handling in JWT authentication workflows. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores and assessments are accurate and should be maintained.",
