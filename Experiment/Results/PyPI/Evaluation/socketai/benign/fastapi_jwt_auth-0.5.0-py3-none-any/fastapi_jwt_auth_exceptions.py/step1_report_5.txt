  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various JWT-related errors in a FastAPI application.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or untrusted data sources are read; only class definitions and initializers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only defines exceptions with message and status_code attributes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code does not process or manipulate data beyond storing parameters in class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code strictly defines exception classes with no side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. Each class initializes with status_code and message, and no data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The code appears to be standard for structured error handling in an auth system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of well-structured exception classes for JWT errors, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for error management and does not perform any harmful operations.",
