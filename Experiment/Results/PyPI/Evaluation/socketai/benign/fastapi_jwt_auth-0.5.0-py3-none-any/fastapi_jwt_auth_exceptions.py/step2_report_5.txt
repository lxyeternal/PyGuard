  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review and Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for JWT-related errors in a FastAPI context.\n   - Each class stores a `status_code` and `message`, which are typical for error handling.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no external data processing, network calls, or sensitive operations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that these are standard exception class definitions.\n   - They note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or misleading claims are present in the reports.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurately describe the code as benign and boilerplate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious code patterns are present, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unjustified.\n   - The code is purely definitional, serving as structured error handling.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's purpose and structure.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions and scores. The code is standard, safe, and intended solely for error handling.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The code poses no security threat.",
