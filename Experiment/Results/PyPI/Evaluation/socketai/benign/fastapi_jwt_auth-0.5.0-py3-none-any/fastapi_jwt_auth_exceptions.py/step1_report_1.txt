{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for JWT authentication errors in a FastAPI application",
  "sources": "Class definitions and __init__ methods where error details such as status_code and message are set",
  "sinks": "Potentially any place where these exceptions are caught and processed, but no direct sinks are present in this code",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with status_code and message, then potentially raised and handled elsewhere in the application",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; the code is straightforward exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each representing specific JWT-related errors. Each class stores a status_code and message, but there is no dynamic or external data processing, no code injection, or unsafe handling of inputs. The design is standard for custom exceptions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a boilerplate setup for error handling in a JWT-authenticated FastAPI app.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains standard, well-structured custom exception classes for JWT authentication errors with no malicious or security-compromising behavior present. It is unlikely to be malicious or harmful.",
