  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling JWT-related errors in a FastAPI application",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, especially __init__ methods setting status_code and message",
  "sinks": "Error handling and messaging, possibly logged or returned to API clients",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with status_code and message propagating through error handling mechanisms",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data sources.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. Each class initializes with a status_code and message, which are standard for error reporting. No input sources, data sinks, or data flows involving untrusted data are present within this snippet. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious logic are visible. The structure is consistent with typical error handling patterns in Python web applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for defining exception classes related to JWT authentication errors. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The purpose appears to be clean error categorization without any suspicious functionality.",
