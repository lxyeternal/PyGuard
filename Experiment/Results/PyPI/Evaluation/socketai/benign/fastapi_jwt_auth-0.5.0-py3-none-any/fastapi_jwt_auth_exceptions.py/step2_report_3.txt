  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely defining custom exception classes for JWT errors.\n- No external data sources, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The purpose is standard error handling in a FastAPI JWT context.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not process or handle untrusted input directly; it merely defines exception classes.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data manipulation.\n- The exception classes store status_code and message, which are typical for API error responses.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only minor note is that the exception classes could benefit from inheriting from `HTTPException` or similar, but that does not impact security—it's a design choice.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The exception classes are standard, safe, and serve their intended purpose without any malicious or security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a boilerplate setup for structured error handling in a JWT-authenticated FastAPI app.",
