  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for JWT-related errors.\n- Each class simply stores a status_code and message.\n- No dynamic code, external data processing, or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The purpose appears to be structured error handling within a FastAPI JWT authentication context.\n\n**Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All indicate that the code is purely definitional, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no external inputs or data sinks.\n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- Malware: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated: 0, which is correct given the straightforward nature.\n- Security risk: 0, consistent with the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The exception classes are initialized with `status_code` and `message`, but they do not call `super().__init__()`. While not strictly necessary, this could affect exception chaining or traceback readability. However, this is a coding style choice rather than a security flaw.\n- The code could be improved by calling `super().__init__(message)` in each class to ensure proper exception behavior, but this does not impact security or malware detection.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The analysis correctly states there are no malicious behaviors.\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and safe.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (no obfuscation)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, intended for error handling, and does not pose any security threats. The scoring and analysis are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n- The overall security assessment remains that this code is benign.",
