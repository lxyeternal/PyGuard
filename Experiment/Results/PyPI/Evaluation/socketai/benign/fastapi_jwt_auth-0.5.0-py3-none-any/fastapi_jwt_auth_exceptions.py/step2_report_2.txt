  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely defining custom exception classes for JWT errors.\n   - No evidence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - The classes only store a status_code and message, with no data processing, network calls, or external data handling.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for error handling in a FastAPI JWT context.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The exception classes are well-structured, inheriting from a base class, with clear purpose.\n   - The __init__ methods correctly assign parameters to instance variables.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n   - Given the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify that this code does not introduce security risks.\n   - Since no dynamic or external data processing occurs here, the risk scores should remain low.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is a boilerplate setup for structured error handling related to JWT authentication in a FastAPI app. It is benign, well-structured, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate. The exception classes are standard, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
