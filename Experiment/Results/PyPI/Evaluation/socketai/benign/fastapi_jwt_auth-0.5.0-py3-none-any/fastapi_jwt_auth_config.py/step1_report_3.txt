{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Pydantic model for JWT authentication configuration, including validation rules for various settings related to token handling, cookie options, and CSRF protection.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters for JWT authentication such as token locations, secret keys, algorithms, expiration times, cookie settings, and CSRF methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure if secret keys or sensitive parameters are exposed or misconfigured; validation logic ensures proper values but does not handle secrets securely.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are validated and stored within the model, with no external data flow or untrusted input sources evident in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The default values are standard, and no suspicious external network activity or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on defining a configuration schema with validation rules for JWT-related settings. It uses Pydantic validators to ensure proper value constraints. No external data input or output is performed beyond setting configuration values. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to be a standard configuration model, with appropriate validation to prevent common misconfigurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration schema for JWT authentication settings with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It includes validation to enforce correct parameter values but does not handle secrets or sensitive data insecurely. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
