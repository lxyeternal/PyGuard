  "purpose": "Defines a Pydantic configuration model for JWT-based authentication settings in a web application.",
  "sources": "Data is read from class attributes and validators; no external input handling shown.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external system interactions; no writing or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from attribute values through validators for validation and normalization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Default values are benign. Validation logic appears standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with various optional configuration parameters related to JWT authentication. Validators enforce correct values for token expiration, token locations, CSRF methods, etc., primarily to prevent misconfiguration. Defaults are set to common secure defaults, with no indication of malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, external calls, or data leaks are present. The code is well-structured, follows standard practices, and contains no anomalies suggesting malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign configuration model for JWT authentication, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
