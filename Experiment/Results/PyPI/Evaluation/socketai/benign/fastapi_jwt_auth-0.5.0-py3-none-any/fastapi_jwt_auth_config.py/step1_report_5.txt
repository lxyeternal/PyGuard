  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for JWT authentication settings using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters and default values from class attributes and validators.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly validates input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validators which enforce constraints and formats.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or backdoors observed. Use of default token locations and cookie names is standard. No unusual code structures or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic BaseModel subclass to manage JWT configuration options, including token expiration, cookie settings, CSRF protection, and validation rules. Validators enforce acceptable values for certain fields, such as token locations, expiration behaviors, and HTTP methods. No external input handling or dynamic code execution is present. The code is well-structured, standard, and lacks any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward configuration model for JWT authentication settings with proper validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious code or backdoors are evident.",
