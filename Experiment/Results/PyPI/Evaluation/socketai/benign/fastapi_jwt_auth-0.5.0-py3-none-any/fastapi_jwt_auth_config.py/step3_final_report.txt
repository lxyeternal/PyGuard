{
  "purpose": "Defines a Pydantic model for JWT configuration with validation for various settings such as token locations, secrets, algorithms, expiration times, cookie options, and CSRF protections.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters provided as class attributes with default values and validators enforcing correct value ranges and types.",
  "sinks": "No external data flow, network calls, or output operations; configuration data is used internally within the application.",
  "flows": "Validation functions enforce correct values for each field, preventing misconfiguration; no untrusted data flows outside the model.",
  "anomalies": "Default values for 'authjwt_token_location' and 'authjwt_denylist_token_checks' are set as mutable sets, which is unconventional and could lead to bugs, but not security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard JWT configuration schema using Pydantic, with validators ensuring correct parameter values. No secrets are hardcoded, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling are present. The only minor anomaly is the use of mutable sets as default values, which could cause unintended behavior but does not constitute malicious activity. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and very low security risks. The default set issue is a coding concern rather than a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured JWT configuration schema with no malicious intent or malware. The only improvement is to replace mutable default sets with immutable types like tuples or lists to prevent potential bugs. Overall, the code is safe for use, with scores reflecting minimal risk.",
