  "purpose": "Define a configuration model for JWT authentication settings in a web application using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Class attributes and their default values, validators for fields",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks; configuration parameters are stored and validated internally",
  "flows": "Input data (configuration values) flows through validators to ensure correctness and constraints",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; default token expiry times are set, but not suspicious; validators perform expected validation logic; no obfuscated code or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with various optional configuration fields related to JWT setup, including token locations, secrets, algorithms, expiry times, cookie options, and CSRF protections. Validators ensure that certain fields adhere to expected values, such as token location, expiry flags, and CSRF methods. Default values appear standard, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident. The code strictly validates input configuration data, which aligns with standard practices for secure configuration management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration schema for JWT settings with proper validation, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
