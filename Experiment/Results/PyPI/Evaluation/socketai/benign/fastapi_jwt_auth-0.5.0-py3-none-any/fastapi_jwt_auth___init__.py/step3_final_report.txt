  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization for FastAPI JWT extension, defining version and importing AuthJWT class.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.auth_jwt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only import statement and version declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with a descriptive docstring, version string, and import statement. It contains no executable logic, data inputs, or outputs. The security posture depends on the implementation of '.auth_jwt', which is not provided. The code itself shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The minimal nature and reliance on a local module suggest benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight security risk score reflects dependency trust but is justified given the lack of evidence of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minimal setup and import are standard for package modules. The security risk is negligible, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity. The overall assessment confirms that this is a safe, non-malicious module initialization snippet.",
