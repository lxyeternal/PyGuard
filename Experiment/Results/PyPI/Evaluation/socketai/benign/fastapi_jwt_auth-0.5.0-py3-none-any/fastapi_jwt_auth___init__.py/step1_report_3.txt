  "purpose": "Provide JWT authentication support for FastAPI applications",
  "sources": "Importing the AuthJWT class from the local auth_jwt module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no secrets, no suspicious logic or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module initialization with a version string and an import statement. There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or external network calls. The import suggests reliance on external code, but does not indicate malicious intent. No unusual language features or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup for JWT support with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It appears to be a safe component of a larger application.",
