  "purpose": "Provide JWT authentication support as a FastAPI extension.",
  "sources": "Importing AuthJWT from a local module (.auth_jwt). No input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and typical for a package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module with a version string and imports a class from a local module, which is common in package setup. There are no signs of suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The imported module (.auth_jwt) could contain relevant logic, but based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization for a FastAPI extension. No malware or security risks are evident from this snippet. The security posture depends on the contents of .auth_jwt, which is not provided here.",
