  "purpose": "Provide JWT authentication support as an extension for FastAPI.",
  "sources": "Importing AuthJWT from local module auth_jwt.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data flow analysis applicable with this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows observable in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports a class from a local module, likely part of a larger package. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows visible. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are evident. Since the auth_jwt module is imported but not shown, potential risks depend on that module's implementation, but from this snippet alone, nothing suspicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module initialization snippet for a FastAPI extension, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this code fragment.",
