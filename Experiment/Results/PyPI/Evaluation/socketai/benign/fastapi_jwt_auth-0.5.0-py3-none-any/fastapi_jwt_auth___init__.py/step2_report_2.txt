  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet review:**\n```python\n\"\"\"FastAPI extension that provides JWT Auth support (secure, easy to use and lightweight)\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"0.5.0\"\n\nfrom .auth_jwt import AuthJWT\n```\nThis is a minimal module setup: a descriptive docstring, a version string, and an import statement from a local module. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic within this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is straightforward and typical for a package initialization.\n- The actual security or malicious behavior would depend on the implementation of `.auth_jwt`, which is not shown.\n- No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, network calls, or obfuscation are present.\n- The import path is local, which is common for package modules.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No anomalies, no suspicious constructs, relies on external module.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign, and the high confidence is justified.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, minimal code, no malicious signs.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with a slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). This might be overly cautious given the code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Since the code is minimal, the securityRisk score could be lowered to 0 unless there's a reason to suspect the imported module.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, standard package setup.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Again, the minimal code does not justify a securityRisk of 0.1; it should probably be 0.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same reasoning, very low risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the risk score seems slightly inflated.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusions:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** Slightly high at 0.1 in some reports, but given the minimal code snippet, this is likely overestimating risk. The risk should be **0** unless the imported module (`auth_jwt`) is malicious or insecure, which cannot be determined from this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Adjust the `securityRisk` scores** for all reports to **0**, since the code is benign and minimal.\n- The `malware` and `obfuscated` scores are correctly 0.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the limited scope.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            | No suspicious activity; minimal code. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Same reasoning. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Overestimated; no risk from snippet. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Same. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Same. |\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\nThe security posture depends heavily on the implementation of `.auth_jwt`. If that module contains vulnerabilities or malicious code, the risk scores should be adjusted accordingly. However, based solely on this snippet, all scores should be minimal.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence presented.",
