  "purpose": "Provides JWT authentication support for FastAPI applications.",
  "sources": "Imports AuthJWT class from a local module auth_jwt.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A – only module import and version declaration, no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a descriptive comment, a version string, and an import statement from a local module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic present that could be exploited or contain malicious behavior. The import source appears to be a local module, and there is no evidence of obfuscation or malicious patterns. No sensitive data handling, external network connections, or executable code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, benign module definition for a FastAPI JWT extension, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
