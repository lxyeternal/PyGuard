{
  "purpose": "Provides a FastAPI extension that supports JWT authentication.",
  "sources": "Imports the AuthJWT class from a local module auth_jwt.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports a module and sets version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, consisting of a version string and an import statement from a local module. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no operations that could be malicious. The imported module 'auth_jwt' is not shown; thus, potential malicious behavior might reside there, but based on this snippet alone, no malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module initialization with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external communications. The security risk and malware scores are both very low.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
