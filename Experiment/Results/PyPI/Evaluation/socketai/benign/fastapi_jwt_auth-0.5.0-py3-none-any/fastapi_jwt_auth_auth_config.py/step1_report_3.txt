  "purpose": "Configuration class for managing JWT settings in a FastAPI application, including security parameters like secret keys, algorithms, token expiration, and CSRF protections.",
  "sources": "Configuration attributes initialized as class variables, loaded via load_config method from external settings, callback registration for denylist checks.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data (keys, secrets, tokens) stored in class variables; the callback function for denylist could be used maliciously if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "load_config method reads external settings to populate class variables; token_in_denylist_loader method registers a callback function for token revocation checks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors detected. Use of class variables for sensitive data is typical for configuration. No hardcoded secrets visible.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a configuration class with attributes for JWT security parameters, loaded dynamically via a class method. The load_config method maps external settings to internal variables, with exception handling for validation errors. The token_in_denylist_loader method allows registration of a callback for token revocation logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The presence of callback registration is standard for JWT denylist mechanisms. Sensitive data like secret keys are expected to be provided externally, not hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration handler for JWT settings with no indications of malicious intent. It handles sensitive parameters securely by relying on external settings and provides extensibility via callback registration for token revocation. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
