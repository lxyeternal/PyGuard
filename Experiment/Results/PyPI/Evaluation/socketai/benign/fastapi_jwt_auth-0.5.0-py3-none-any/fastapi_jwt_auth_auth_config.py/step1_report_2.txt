{
  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for JWT authentication in a FastAPI application, allowing dynamic loading of settings and setting up callback functions for token denial.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration settings via a callable that returns a list of tuples, and loads them into class variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that process untrusted input directly or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Configuration settings are loaded from an external source via load_config, and a callback can be registered for denylist checking.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The class only manages configuration data and a callback function. No malicious behaviors like network connections, file modifications, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages JWT configuration parameters for authentication, with mechanisms to load settings dynamically and set a callback for denylist checks. It does not perform any network operations, data processing, or other potentially malicious actions. The only notable dynamic feature is the ability to set a callback for denylist logic, which is a standard practice. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears secure and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration class for JWT in a FastAPI app with no malicious behavior. It handles settings and callback registration securely without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
