{
  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for JWT authentication using FastAPI, including loading settings and setting callback for denylist checks.",
  "sources": "Settings loaded via the load_config method, reading from a callable returning a list of tuples.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing is present.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are loaded into class variables; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets are not evident; configuration parameters are typical for JWT setup. No suspicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to set up a configuration class for JWT authentication, with properties and a method to load settings from an external source. It uses standard practices and relies on the LoadConfig class, which is assumed to be a safe data structure. No malicious behavior, malicious code injection, or suspicious data handling is evident. There are no obfuscation patterns, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. It primarily manages configuration parameters for JWT and CSRF protections. No hardcoded credentials or insecure code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for JWT in FastAPI, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It appears safe based on the provided code snippet.",
