{
  "purpose": "This code defines a configuration class for JWT authentication in a FastAPI application, allowing dynamic loading of settings and setting a callback for token denylist checking.",
  "sources": "Configuration values set in the load_config class method, including environment or settings inputs; callback function set via token_in_denylist_loader.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems, files, or network in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Settings are loaded and assigned to class variables; callback is stored for later invocation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Configuration properties appear standard for JWT setup.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages JWT configuration, including secrets and keys, and allows a user-defined callback for denylist checks. No input/output operations, network calls, or suspicious code patterns are present. The load_config method relies on validated config objects, and exception handling is appropriate. Overall, the code appears to be standard configuration management for JWT in FastAPI with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for JWT authentication, loading settings dynamically and allowing a callback for denylist validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet.",
