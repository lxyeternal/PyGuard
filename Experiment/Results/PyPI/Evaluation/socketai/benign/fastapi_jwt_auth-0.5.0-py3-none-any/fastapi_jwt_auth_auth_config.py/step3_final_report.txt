  "purpose": "Configuration management for JWT settings in FastAPI, including loading external settings and registering denylist callbacks.",
  "sources": "External settings provided via load_config, callback function registered via token_in_denylist_loader",
  "sinks": "Callback function invoked during token validation, configuration parameters used in JWT processing",
  "flows": "Settings are loaded into class variables; callback stored and invoked during token checks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; callback is user-defined and external",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for JWT in FastAPI, managing parameters and callback registration. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The only potential risk stems from the user-defined callback, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is standard practice and outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the configuration nature and external callback handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard JWT configuration class with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose. No modifications are necessary.",
