{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing JWT authentication configuration in a FastAPI application, including loading settings and denylist callback.",
  "sources": "Settings provided via the 'settings' callable passed to 'load_config'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; configuration values are stored as class variables, and the callback is set via a setter method.",
  "flows": "Settings are loaded from external source and assigned to class variables; callback function is stored for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages configuration data for JWT authentication, including loading from external settings, with no evident malicious logic. The 'load_config' method safely maps external settings to class attributes, and the callback setter simply stores a user-defined function. There are no network operations, data leaks, or suspicious code execution pathways. The code's structure is standard for configuration management, with proper exception handling for validation errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration class for JWT settings with no malicious intent. It does not perform any network activity, data theft, or backdoor functions. The only potential concern is if the callback function supplied to 'token_in_denylist_loader' is malicious, but this is user-defined and not inherently suspicious within this code.",
