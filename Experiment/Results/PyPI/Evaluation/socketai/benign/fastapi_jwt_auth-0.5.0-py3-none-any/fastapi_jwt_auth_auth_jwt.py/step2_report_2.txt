  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard JWT handler for FastAPI, managing token creation, validation, and cookies. No malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score aligns with the description.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard JWT practices, CSRF protection, and token validation. No malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no issues found.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Also a standard JWT implementation with token creation, validation, cookie management, and CSRF protection. Notes the optional callback for token revocation but no malicious implications.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate; no signs of sabotage.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard JWT handling, with token creation, validation, and cookie management. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar, emphasizing secure token management, CSRF, and proper validation. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** The code is a comprehensive JWT handler for FastAPI, including token creation, validation, cookie management, CSRF protection, and revocation checks. All functions appear to implement standard practices.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Security & Risks:** The risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), which seems appropriate given the code's nature. The code relies on environment variables or external secrets, which is standard practice, not suspicious.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor point is the use of `jwt.encode().decode('utf-8')`, which may raise warnings in recent PyJWT versions (since `jwt.encode()` now returns a string). This is not malicious but should be updated for compatibility.\n\n- **Token Revocation & Callbacks:** The callback mechanism for token revocation is standard but can be misused if misconfigured. However, the code itself does not implement or include such a callback; it merely provides hooks.\n\n- **Assumptions & Claims:** The code does not make unsafe assumptions or perform unsafe operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to reliance on external secrets and callback mechanisms, but overall low risk given the context.\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a well-structured, standard JWT authentication module for FastAPI, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
