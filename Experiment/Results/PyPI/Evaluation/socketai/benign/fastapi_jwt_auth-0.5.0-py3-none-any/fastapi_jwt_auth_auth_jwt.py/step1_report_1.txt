{
  "purpose": "The code defines an AuthJWT class for managing JWT-based authentication in FastAPI applications, including token creation, validation, and cookie handling.",
  "sources": "Request headers (for JWT in headers), cookies (for JWT in cookies), internal methods generating identifiers and secret keys, and JWT encode/decode functions.",
  "sinks": "JWT encoding (jwt.encode), decoding (jwt.decode), setting cookies in responses, and raising exceptions based on token validation.",
  "flows": "Sources such as headers and cookies flow into validation functions which decode and verify JWTs; verified tokens flow into access control checks and are used for setting or deleting cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or backdoors; usage of standard jwt library and methods; no hidden or malicious data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of JWT handling with comprehensive validation, token creation, and cookie management. It includes functions for generating tokens, verifying them, handling CSRF protection, and managing cookies. The use of jwt library is standard, and the methods perform typical security checks without evident malicious intent. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. Error handling is consistent, and the logic aligns with common secure JWT practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical JWT authentication module for FastAPI, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles token creation, validation, and cookie management securely and appropriately. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
