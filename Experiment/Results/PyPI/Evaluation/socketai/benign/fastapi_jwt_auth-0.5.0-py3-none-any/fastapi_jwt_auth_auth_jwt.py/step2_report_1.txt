  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard JWT handling class with token creation, validation, cookie management, CSRF protection, and error handling.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Uses standard jwt library functions. The confidence level is high (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is sound, typical for JWT implementations, and no suspicious behavior detected.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard JWT handling, cookie management, CSRF protection, and token validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. Proper validation and error handling. The malware score remains 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with standard practices; no malicious intent or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements JWT with token creation, validation, cookie management, CSRF, and token revocation via callback.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The optional revocation callback is a standard pattern but could be misused if improperly configured—however, this is not malicious per se.\n- **Assessment:** The code is secure and standard; no signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are justified; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar JWT handling with token creation, validation, CSRF, and cookie management.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious activity. Use of environment variables for secrets is typical. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The implementation aligns with best practices.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard JWT with token management, cookies, CSRF, and validation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Use of standard libraries and patterns. No signs of sabotage.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears secure and well-structured.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are justified; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The code is a typical JWT utility with no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports confirm no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Given the thorough validation, proper error handling, and standard practices, the risk is low. The reported risk scores (~0.2) seem reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code uses well-known libraries (`jwt`) and standard patterns for token creation, validation, and cookie management.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- The optional revocation callback, while a potential misconfiguration point, is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.\n- The logic and security practices are consistent with industry standards.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.2** — low, consistent with proper implementation but always depends on external secret management.\n\n**Note:** The scores are aligned with the detailed analysis. No significant concerns or deviations are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The supply chain security of this code appears solid based on the provided reports. Proper secret management outside the code and correct configuration are essential, but the code itself does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
