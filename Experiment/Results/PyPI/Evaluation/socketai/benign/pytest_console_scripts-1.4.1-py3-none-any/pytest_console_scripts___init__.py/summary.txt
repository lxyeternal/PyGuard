  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured testing utility with no malicious intent or sabotage signals. Its use of dynamic code execution and plugin loading introduces minimal risk in controlled environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor inherent risks associated with dynamic execution but overall safety within testing contexts."
