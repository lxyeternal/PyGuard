  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply assigns a static string `'2.0.2'` to the variable `VERSION`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or other suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for version declarations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is non-malicious is appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, there's no basis for higher risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware`: 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - No reason to change this score.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores align well with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - No inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- The code snippet is a standard version assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores (confidence=1, malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, and the assigned scores reflect its harmless nature.",
