  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**: All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable `VERSION`. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. This is a standard practice in software modules for version tracking.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**: None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The code snippets are straightforward and minimal.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n4. **Potential Issues & Assumptions**: The reports are consistent and do not make unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities. They correctly identify that this is a benign, standard version declaration.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\nThis code snippet is a typical, benign version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on all reports, the code is entirely benign. The scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
