  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a static string to the variable VERSION.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '2.0.2' to the variable VERSION. It contains no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or external interactions. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for version declaration. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and clarity strongly suggest it is a standard version declaration without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version string assignment with no malicious or security-related issues. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
