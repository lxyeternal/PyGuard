  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code snippet is simply a static assignment of a version string (`VERSION = \"2.0.2\"`). There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. Based on the code provided, there are no issues or malicious behaviors present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and typical for version declaration. They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no suspicious constructs, and no signs of malware or obfuscation. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely a static version string assignment with no dynamic or external interactions, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted. The reports correctly assign a risk score of 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is consistent with the code's benign nature. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code as a simple version string declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Security Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no security implications.",
