  "purpose": "AWS AppConfig helper class for fetching and parsing configuration data from AWS services, supporting JSON and YAML formats.",
  "sources": "AWS SDK responses, configuration data retrieved via boto3 client methods.",
  "sinks": "Internal storage of parsed configuration, no external data leaks or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from AWS SDK responses through parsing routines into internal variables; no external or untrusted data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, standard library usage, proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward helper for AWS AppConfig, utilizing standard boto3 SDK calls, with optional YAML parsing if available. It manages configuration sessions, updates, and parsing with appropriate error handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are present. The code handles untrusted data but does so securely, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The security risk stems solely from the inherent nature of parsing untrusted configuration data, which is minimal and justified. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, well-implemented AWS AppConfig helper class with no malicious signals or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's content and behavior.",
