  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual logic, the scores assigned, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a straightforward AWS AppConfig helper, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is indeed a standard configuration helper, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score seems appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a well-structured, secure helper class with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no suspicious behaviors. The confidence is high, and the scores reflect that.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report emphasizes the security and correctness of the code, with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The slight increase in security risk score (0.2) might reflect a conservative stance due to the handling of untrusted configuration data. Since the code parses data that could be crafted maliciously, but does not perform any dangerous operations, this score seems acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe operation, proper error handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code's logic does not introduce any malware risk. The slightly higher security risk score accounts for potential issues with untrusted configuration data, which is inherent to such configuration loaders.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, describes a legitimate AWS helper class with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network exfiltration, or code injection.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2). Given that the code handles untrusted configuration data, a low to moderate risk score is justified, but nothing indicates a high security concern.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk, inherent to configuration parsing but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code's actual logic. No changes needed. The code is a standard, well-implemented AWS AppConfig helper with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
