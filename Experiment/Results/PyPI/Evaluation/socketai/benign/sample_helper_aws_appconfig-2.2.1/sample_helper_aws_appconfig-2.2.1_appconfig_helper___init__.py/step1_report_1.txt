  "purpose": "Export the AppConfigHelper class for external use in the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AppConfigHelper from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow, just an import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named AppConfigHelper from a sibling module and then exposes it via __all__. There are no functions, no data processing, no network operations, or any other behavior that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears to serve a simple modular purpose of re-exporting a class. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard module export pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks present.",
