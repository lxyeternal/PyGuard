  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources involving untrusted data are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The use of a relative import (`from .appconfig_helper import AppConfigHelper`) is standard in package modules.\n- The comment `# noqa: F401` is used to suppress linter warnings about unused imports; this is common practice and not suspicious.\n\n**Code confirmation:**\n- The original code snippet matches the reports: it imports `AppConfigHelper` from a sibling module and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- There are no functions, no data processing, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is straightforward and benign.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The comment `# noqa: F401` is appropriate for suppressing unused import warnings; no issue there.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty based on the minimal and standard pattern.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize that this is just a module re-export pattern.\n- No claims of malicious activity are made or justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign module pattern with no security risks.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward module export pattern with no malicious or suspicious activity. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
