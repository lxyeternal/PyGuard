  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the reported issues against the code.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .appconfig_helper import AppConfigHelper  # noqa: F401\n\n__all__ = [\"AppConfigHelper\"]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code imports `AppConfigHelper` and exposes it via `__all__`. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is a minimal, benign module pattern with no security risks.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues found. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the benign nature and standard import/export pattern.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the straightforward import and export with no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard boilerplate.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing the benign, standard pattern.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No signs of malicious activity or security concerns.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the benign nature, straightforward import/export, no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** The report is consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.\n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a simple import and export pattern, with no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risk:** All reports correctly assign zero scores, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Potential issues:** No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain **0**, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain **0**, as the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain **0**, since the code poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Given the simplicity of this module, I agree with all the provided assessments. No changes are necessary.",
