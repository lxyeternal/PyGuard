  "purpose": "The code defines an import statement for a class called AppConfigHelper and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module .appconfig_helper to import AppConfigHelper.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports AppConfigHelper from a local module and makes it available for external modules.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a no-ops comment '# noqa: F401' which suppresses unused import warnings. No suspicious or unusual behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal module that imports a class from a sibling module and defines __all__ for export. No input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling occurs here. The use of a relative import suggests this is part of a package. No signs of malicious intent or anomalous behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import/export declaration with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be standard boilerplate code.",
