{
  "purpose": "This code module exports the AppConfigHelper class for external use, likely as part of a larger package related to application configuration handling.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement: 'from .appconfig_helper import AppConfigHelper', which reads the AppConfigHelper class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling in this code; the code solely defines exports.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads the AppConfigHelper class into the namespace; there are no data flows or processing occurring beyond this import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. The import statement is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, then explicitly declares the export list. It contains no user input handling, no network operations, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments. The presence of the 'noqa' comment suggests attention to style issues but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical module definition for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module that exports a class for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and straightforward.",
