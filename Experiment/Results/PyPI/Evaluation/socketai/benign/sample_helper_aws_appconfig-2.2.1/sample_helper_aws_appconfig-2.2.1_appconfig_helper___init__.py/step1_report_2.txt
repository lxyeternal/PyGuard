{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API for a module by importing and exporting AppConfigHelper.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .appconfig_helper import AppConfigHelper",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data flows present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports and exports a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a single import statement and an __all__ declaration. It imports a class from a sibling module and exposes it publicly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The import is standard and safe, and the __all__ list correctly controls the module's public API.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
