  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a minimal, straightforward import and export pattern. The original code snippet only imports `AppConfigHelper` from a sibling module and exposes it via `__all__`. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors that could be malicious.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard boilerplate, and free of anomalies or suspicious patterns. No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.  \n   **Conclusion**: No errors or flaws in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. Since there's no malicious activity, these scores seem appropriate.  \n   **Suggestion**: No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since all assessments indicate the code is benign, there is no justification for elevating the risk scores above 0.5. The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious operations.  \n   **Conclusion**: Keep risk scores at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code's behavior.  \n   **Note**: No malicious intent or activity is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and based on observable code behavior. They do not speculate beyond what the code shows.  \n   **Conclusion**: No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward module export pattern with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.**",
