{
  "purpose": "The code imports a class named AppConfigHelper from a local module and exports it for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .appconfig_helper imports AppConfigHelper; the __all__ list declares exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; the code does not process user input or external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data processing paths; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a helper class and specifies it as an export for the module. It uses a standard import statement with a comment to ignore linter warnings. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. The code appears to be a simple module setup with no potential for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module definition with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is a standard pattern for exposing a class in a package.",
