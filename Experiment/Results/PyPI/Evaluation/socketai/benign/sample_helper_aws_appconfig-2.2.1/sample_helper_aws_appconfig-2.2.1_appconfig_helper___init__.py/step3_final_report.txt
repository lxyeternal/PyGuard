  "purpose": "Minimal module that imports AppConfigHelper from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .appconfig_helper, which reads the AppConfigHelper class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "Import source flows directly to the __all__ export; no data processing or external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import and export pattern with a linter suppression comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports a class from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import statement includes a linter suppression comment, which is common practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate a benign purpose. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the minimal and transparent code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module pattern with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
