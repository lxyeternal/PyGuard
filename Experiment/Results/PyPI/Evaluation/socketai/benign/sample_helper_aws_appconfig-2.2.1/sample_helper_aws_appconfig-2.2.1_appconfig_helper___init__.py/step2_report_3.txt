  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a minimal import/export pattern.\n   - The code simply imports `AppConfigHelper` from a sibling module and exposes it via `__all__`.\n   - No data processing, network activity, user input handling, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious activity are present.\n   - The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n   - The mention of the `# noqa: F401` comment is correctly interpreted as a linter suppression, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable for such straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a high risk score.\n   - The code is benign; thus, risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to it.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Since no malicious activity is observed, malware scores of 0 are justified.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and rely on observable code structure.\n   - No unwarranted claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward module that imports and re-exports a class. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
