  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for handling range and multipart responses with validation checks. The only notable issue is a malformed regex pattern that could impair functionality but does not suggest malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to reliance on assertions and header parsing. Correcting the regex pattern would improve robustness."
