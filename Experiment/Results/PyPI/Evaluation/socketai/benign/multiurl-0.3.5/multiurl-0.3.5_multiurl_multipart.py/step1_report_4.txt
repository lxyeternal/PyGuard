Potentially, the content could be manipulated if headers are not properly validated, but the code does not execute or evaluate untrusted input directly.\",\n  \"flows\": \"HTTP response headers (content-type, content-range) are parsed and validated; stream content is yielded; multipart headers are parsed and matched via regex; byte-range information flows from headers into assertions and calculations.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The code contains multiple assertions that validate header formats and byte ranges, but no validation of the source URL or request parameters. The regex used for content-range parsing contains a pattern (r\\\"^bytes (\\\\d+)d?-(\\\\d+)d?/(\\d+)d?$\\\") that appears to be malformed: the 'd?' appears misplaced; it might be intended as optional digits but is used incorrectly, which could cause parsing failures or unexpected behavior. No explicit hard-coded credentials or secret data is present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is detected.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code implements multipart and byte-range streaming for HTTP downloads, with validation steps for response headers and byte ranges to prevent common errors. The regex pattern used for parsing 'content-range' headers appears malformed due to incorrect placement of 'd?', which may lead to header parsing failures. All data flows are from network responses; no untrusted input is executed as code. The assertions serve as safety checks but could cause crashes if headers are malformed. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of HTTP byte-range streaming with validation, with a minor regex issue that might impair functionality but not maliciousness.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a standard multipart and byte-range streaming implementation with header validation. The only anomaly is the malformed regex pattern for parsing content-range headers, which could cause failures but does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate, with low risk and no malicious behavior.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
