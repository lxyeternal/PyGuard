  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library called 'multiurl' intended to facilitate multi-URL downloads and support for multi-part URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__version__' variable from 'multiurl/__init__.py' and the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or executed directly.",
  "flows": "Reads version information and long description, then passes them to setuptools.setup() without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the version string from a specific module, ensuring version consistency. It reads the README file for long description content. The setup() function is used with typical parameters, including author info, dependencies, and classifiers. No untrusted data is executed or written. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious imports or behaviors. The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script for distributing a Python library. It performs no malicious actions, contains no obfuscated or suspicious code, and has no indicators of supply chain or malware threats.",
