{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the multiurl Python package, used to define package metadata, dependencies, and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from the package's __init__.py file and reads the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing, no output to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from __init__.py, then proceeds to package setup; no data flows from external sources or untrusted inputs to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script structure, no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations for a Python package, including reading version info and long description, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No input validation issues or malicious code is detected. All dependencies are standard and necessary for packaging. The code is straightforward and follows common practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, nor does it perform any harmful actions.",
