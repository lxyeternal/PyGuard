  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'multiurl' Python project, which facilitates downloading multiple URLs and supports multi-part URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from the '__init__.py' file and the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code only reads files and sets up package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> Sets up package metadata with setuptools -> Uses external files for description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It reads version info from the package's __init__.py file and long description from README.md. It uses setuptools to configure package details, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data handling from untrusted sources. The script does not include or execute any malicious or suspicious code. It adheres to typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
