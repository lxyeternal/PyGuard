  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads version info and README for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version from multiurl/__init__.py; reads README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; no network or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description, then calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing package configuration. It reads version info and description files, then invokes setuptools.setup() with standard arguments. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data leaks. All signals indicate benign, routine package setup code without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriately zero, reflecting its benign nature.",
