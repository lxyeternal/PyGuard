{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'multiurl' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the package's __init__.py file to extract version; reading README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No external data is processed unsafely.",
  "flows": "Reading version from __init__.py -> setup configuration. Reading README.md -> long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The code adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads package metadata, such as version and long description, and then calls setuptools.setup() with package info. It dynamically extracts the version number from the __init__.py file, which is a common pattern. The code does not execute any untrusted input or perform any network or system modifications. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without handling untrusted data or executing suspicious operations.",
