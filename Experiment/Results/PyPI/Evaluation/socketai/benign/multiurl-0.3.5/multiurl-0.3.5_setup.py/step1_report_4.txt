  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'multiurl', used for package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ variable from 'multiurl/__init__.py' and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no data is being written or sent to external sources within this script.",
  "flows": "Reading version information from a file and setting up package metadata for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py pattern, no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code reads the package version from an internal file and reads a Markdown file for the long description. It then proceeds to configure package installation details via setuptools.setup(). All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any code execution based on untrusted input, nor does it include hidden backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves only to facilitate package distribution and installation.",
