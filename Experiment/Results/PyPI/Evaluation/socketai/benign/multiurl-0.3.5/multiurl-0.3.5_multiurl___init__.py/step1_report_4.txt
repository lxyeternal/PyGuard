  "purpose": "Defines and exports a version and a set of functions/classes from a downloader module for use in other parts of a project.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module (.downloader), assigns version string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no direct data leaks or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains standard license notices and module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initialization script that sets version info and specifies exports. It imports functions and classes from a local 'downloader' module, which is not provided. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors visible in this snippet. The license information indicates proper licensing but does not affect security. There are no data flows or inputs handled directly in this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It serves as an interface to other functionality housed in the 'downloader' module, which is not shown here.",
