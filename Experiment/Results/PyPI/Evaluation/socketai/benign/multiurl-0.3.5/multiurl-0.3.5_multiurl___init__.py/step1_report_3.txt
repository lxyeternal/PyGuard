{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define metadata and import statements for a Python package related to downloading functionality.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data directly; it imports components from another module named '.downloader'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this code snippet; it only defines exports and metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this code, as it only contains import statements and version/export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports functions/classes from a local module '.downloader'. There are no data inputs, user inputs, or network interactions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package modules, with no obfuscated or malicious code evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign part of a Python package setup that manages module exports and metadata. It does not contain malware, suspicious activity, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
