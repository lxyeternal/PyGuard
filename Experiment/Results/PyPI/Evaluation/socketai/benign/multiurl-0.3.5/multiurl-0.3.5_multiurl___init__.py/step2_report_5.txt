  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected. The code only imports, sets a version, and declares API exports.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no issues found.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard module setup.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Typical module initialization.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard import and export setup.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All 0, as there's no indication of vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n**However,** I will note that the 'downloader' module is imported but not provided. If the 'downloader' module contains malicious code, then the overall security posture could be compromised. But based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are appropriate given the provided code.\n- No changes are necessary unless the 'downloader' module itself is suspicious.\n- The code is a standard, benign package component with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence. No further action needed based on this code snippet.",
