  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata and imports from a local 'downloader' module, exposing specific functions and classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from .downloader: Downloader, download, robust; and module attributes __version__ and __all__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only imports and declares metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it sets a version string, defines an export list, and imports specific components from a local module. There are no input handling, network operations, or data processing that could lead to security issues. The content appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file, serving to organize exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is a standard package initialization module.",
