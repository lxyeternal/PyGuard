{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module that imports functions and classes from a local 'downloader' module, sets a version string, and specifies public API components.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local 'downloader' module (import statement), the version string assignment, and the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data processing or external output that could cause data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs static imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from a local module named 'downloader', assigns a version string, and declares the public API via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard module setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module setup with no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be a standard package component.",
