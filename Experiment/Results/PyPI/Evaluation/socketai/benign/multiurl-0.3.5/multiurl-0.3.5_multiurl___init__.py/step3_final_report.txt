{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization module for a Python package, importing specific classes and functions from a local 'downloader' module, setting a version string, and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imports from '.downloader', and the version string '__version__'. No untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions/classes from 'downloader' and exposes them via '__all__'; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors, are present in this static code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing from a local module, setting version info, and defining API exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. All signals indicate benign, standard package setup without security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module initializer with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the analysis.",
