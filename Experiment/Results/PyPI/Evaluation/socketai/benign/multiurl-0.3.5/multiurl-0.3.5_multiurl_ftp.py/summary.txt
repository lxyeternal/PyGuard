  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate FTP downloader with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only potential security consideration is credential handling via URL, which is common but should be used cautiously. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
