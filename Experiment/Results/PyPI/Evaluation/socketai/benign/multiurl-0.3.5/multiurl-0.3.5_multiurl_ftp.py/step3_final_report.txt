{
  "purpose": "Implements FTP download classes with size estimation and transfer methods, parsing URL credentials and connecting via FTP to retrieve files.",
  "sources": "URL parsing for hostname, port, username, password, and file path; FTP connection and login; FTP commands for size and data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "FTP server interactions; data transfer over network; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "URL credentials and hostname -> FTP connection -> login -> size or retrbinary command -> data written to file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; unimplemented PartFTPDownloader raising NotImplementedError; straightforward, non-obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard FTP downloader using Python's ftplib, with URL parsing for connection details. It performs size estimation and data transfer with proper resource management. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident; no obfuscation or backdoors are present. The only minor security concern is handling credentials via URL, which is typical but should be managed carefully if URLs are untrusted. The unimplemented class is benign. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate FTP downloader with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only potential security consideration is credential handling via URL, which is common but should be used cautiously. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
