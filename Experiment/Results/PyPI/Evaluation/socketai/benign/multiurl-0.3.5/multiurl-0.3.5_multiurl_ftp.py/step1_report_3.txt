{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes for downloading files via FTP protocol, including size estimation and transfer functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads URL data from the 'self.url' attribute, including hostname, port, username, password, and file path. Also reads data during FTP transfer via the callback function.",
  "sinks": "Uses FTP login credentials (username and password) which could be hardcoded or obtained from URL. Writes data to a provided file handle during transfer. Closes FTP connection at the end.",
  "flows": "URL parsing extracts credentials and target file. Credentials are used in 'ftp.login'. Data received from 'retrbinary' is written to the file 'f' in the callback, with progress updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are visible; credentials are parsed from URL. The 'PartFTPDownloader' class raises NotImplementedError, which appears intended for future use. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code properly utilizes URL parsing to extract FTP connection details. The FTP connection and login procedures appear standard. Data transfer via 'retrbinary' uses a callback that writes to a file and updates a progress bar. No credentials are hardcoded, and no malicious actions or unusual behaviors are detected. The use of the FTP protocol itself could be considered insecure, but this is context-dependent. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical FTP download patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard FTP download functionality without evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Overall, it appears to be a normal, purpose-built FTP downloader class with no malicious elements.",
