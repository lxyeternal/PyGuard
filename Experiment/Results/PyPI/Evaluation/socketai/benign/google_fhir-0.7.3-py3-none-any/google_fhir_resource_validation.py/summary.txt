  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured validation utility for FHIR resources with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.2), reflecting standard validation concerns rather than actual threats."
