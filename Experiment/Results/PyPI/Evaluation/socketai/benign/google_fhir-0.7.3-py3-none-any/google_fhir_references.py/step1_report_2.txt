  "purpose": "Utilities for traversing and manipulating FHIR reference types in protobuf messages, including parsing, validation, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from protobuf message fields such as 'uri', 'reference_id', 'history', and message descriptors.",
  "sinks": "Sets values into protobuf message fields like 'value', 'reference_id', 'fragment', and copies fields between messages.",
  "flows": "Reads data from message fields (sources), processes and potentially transforms it, then writes to other message fields (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to parse references; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; standard protobuf manipulation; no network operations or data exfiltration found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs validation of FHIR reference messages, parses 'uri' fields using regex to identify internal and fragment references, and populates structured reference ID fields accordingly. It handles copying common fields like 'id' and 'extension', and constructs reference strings for output. All operations are protobuf message manipulations, with no evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or backdoors. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present; the code is clean and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling FHIR references in protobuf messages. It performs expected operations like parsing, validation, and string conversion without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this module.",
