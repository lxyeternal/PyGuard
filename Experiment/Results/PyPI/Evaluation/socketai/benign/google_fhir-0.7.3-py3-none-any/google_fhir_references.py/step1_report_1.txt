  "purpose": "Utilities for traversing and manipulating FHIR reference types, including parsing, validation, and string conversion.",
  "sources": "Reads include regex patterns on 'uri.value', message field values, and message descriptors. Also reads message metadata and fields via proto_utils.",
  "sinks": "Writes to message fields such as 'value', 'reference_id', 'fragment', and 'history'. Uses proto_utils to set values and copy fields.",
  "flows": "URI values are parsed via regex; depending on match, structured fields are populated (e.g., reference_id, fragment). Reference-to-string constructs a URI from message fields.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious hardcoded data. Uses regex to parse known URI patterns, which is standard for such processing. No obfuscated code detected. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code validates and processes FHIR reference messages, parsing 'uri' fields into structured reference IDs or fragments, and vice versa. It relies on standard protobuf message manipulations, regex matching for reference formats, and copying fields between message components. The logic appears consistent with typical FHIR reference handling. No unusual or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors is present. The code's operations are limited to message validation, parsing, and string conversion, all within expected parameters. The use of regex for pattern matching and field manipulations are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard, well-defined operations for handling FHIR references without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical utility module for reference parsing and formatting. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
