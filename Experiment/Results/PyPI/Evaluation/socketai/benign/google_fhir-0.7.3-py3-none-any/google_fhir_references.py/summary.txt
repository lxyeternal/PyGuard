  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for handling FHIR references, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The high security risk score in the initial reports (e.g., 0.9) is unjustified; a score around 0.1 is more appropriate given the code's operations."
