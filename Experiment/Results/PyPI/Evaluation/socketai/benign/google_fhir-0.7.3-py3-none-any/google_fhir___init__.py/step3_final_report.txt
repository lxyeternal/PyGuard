  "purpose": "This code snippet is a license header comment containing licensing information and legal notices.",
  "sources": "The snippet is purely a comment block; no data sources or input reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present, as there is no executable code.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code contains only comments with no runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is standard licensing boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-executable comment block with licensing information. It contains no logic, data handling, or code that could pose security risks. The absence of sources, sinks, or flows indicates no potential attack vectors. The comments are standard and do not include any obfuscation or malicious code. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's nature aligns with typical license headers, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license comment with no executable content or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
