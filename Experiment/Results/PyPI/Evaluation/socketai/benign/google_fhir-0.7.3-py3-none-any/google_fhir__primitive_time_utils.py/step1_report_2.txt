  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling date/time primitives in FHIR resources, including conversions and timezone manipulations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party packages (dateutil, zoneinfo/backports), and proto_utils to access message fields.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if untrusted data is passed to build_date_like or get_date_time_value, especially with timezone or value_us fields.",
  "flows": "Input data from proto_utils or string parsing flows through functions like build_date_like, get_date_time_value, and timezone_info_for_timezone, affecting datetime objects and string representations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to parse timezone offsets and precision patterns; fallback import for zoneinfo; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; handling of timezone info may lead to unusual behavior if inputs are malformed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles date/time conversion and parsing, with safety measures such as try-except for timezone parsing. No data is transmitted externally or written to disk. The regex patterns are standard for date parsing. No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate and safe. No obfuscated code or hidden logic. The fallback for zoneinfo import is standard practice. The functions assume valid inputs and do not execute untrusted code or external commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard date/time processing tasks with appropriate safety checks and fallback mechanisms. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for FHIR date/time primitives.",
