  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling date, time, and timezone conversions in FHIR primitives, facilitating date/time object construction and extraction.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (datetime, re), third-party libraries (dateutil, google.protobuf, google.fhir.utils, zoneinfo/backports.zoneinfo). No user input or external data sources are directly read in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Functions that generate date/time objects and strings, primarily constructing datetime primitives and performing conversions. No data is sent over network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data such as timezone strings, datetime strings, or datetime components flow into functions like timezone_info_for_timezone and build_date_like, which process and produce datetime or primitive instances. No untrusted data is used as a sink in a malicious context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code is well-structured and relies on standard libraries and predictable patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for date/time manipulation with proper handling of timezones and precisions. It uses safe and well-understood libraries like dateutil and zoneinfo, with fallback mechanisms for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The import statements, function logic, and handling of date/time data appear legitimate and consistent with intended functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for managing date/time primitives in a FHIR context. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. Its design and implementation do not raise concerns for supply chain security or malware.",
