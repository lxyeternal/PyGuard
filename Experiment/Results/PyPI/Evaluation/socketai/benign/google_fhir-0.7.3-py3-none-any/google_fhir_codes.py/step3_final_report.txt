  "purpose": "Utility functions for FHIR code systems, including enum conversion, copying, and system info retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reads protobuf message fields, annotations, memoization caches, and message descriptors.",
  "sinks": "Writes to protobuf message fields via setters and copy functions; updates memoization dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Reads message fields and annotations; updates memo caches; performs conversions and copies between message fields.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or external resource access; standard thread-safe memoization; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard protobuf message handling, thread-safe memoization, and annotation utilities for FHIR codes. It performs data transformations, copying, and retrieval with proper error handling and type validation. No external network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility library for FHIR protobuf message handling. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given its functionality. Overall, it is safe for use in security-sensitive environments.",
