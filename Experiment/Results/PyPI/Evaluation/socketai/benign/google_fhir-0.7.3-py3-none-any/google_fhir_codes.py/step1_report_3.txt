{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for manipulating FHIR code systems, including conversions between enum values and code strings, copying coding and code messages, and retrieving system information from code messages.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from protobuf message fields (e.g., 'value', 'system', 'id', 'extension') and from shared memoization dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sinks include message field assignments, copying fields between messages, and returning string representations. No external network or file system access observed.",
  "flows": "Input data from protobuf message fields is processed and converted within functions, with memoization to optimize enum descriptor retrieval; data flows into string conversions, message copying, and exception raising upon errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs detected. Uses standard threading locks for memoization, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code features. No use of external untrusted data sources beyond message fields.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data transformations and copying for FHIR protobuf messages, utilizing standard Python modules and protobuf APIs. It uses memoization for enum descriptor lookups, with thread safety via locks. No malicious payloads, network activity, or privacy violations are present. The functions enforce type checks and handle errors explicitly. There are no signs of hidden backdoors, malicious code, or obfuscation. The code appears well-structured for its purpose without security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility module for handling FHIR protobuf messages related to coding systems. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. It is safe for use in a security-sensitive environment.",
