  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented utility for managing FHIR extensions within protobuf messages. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1) and malware score (0) are justified. The confidence level is high (above 0.9). No modifications to the scores are necessary."
