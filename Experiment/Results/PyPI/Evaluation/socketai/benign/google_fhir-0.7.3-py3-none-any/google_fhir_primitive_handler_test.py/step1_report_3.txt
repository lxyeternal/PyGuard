{
  "purpose": "The code provides abstract test classes for validating the behavior of FHIR primitive handlers, focusing on validation, parsing, and formatting of FHIR primitive data types.",
  "sources": "The code reads test data files for validation (JSON and proto files) from specified validation directories, and constructs primitive data objects for validation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading test data (sources), validating and parsing these data into primitive objects (processing), and ensuring correct validation behavior (outputs). No untrusted data is directly used outside test contexts.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely testing and validation logic with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external communications are detected. The only extensions and test data are standard validation procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive suite of abstract test classes for validating FHIR primitive handler modules. It loads test data from external files, performs validation and parsing tests, and confirms correct handling of various primitive data types. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of external test data files and abstract methods indicates this is a testing framework. All operations are confined to data validation and formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing framework for FHIR primitive validation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It mainly reads test data and performs validation, with no evidence of sabotage, malicious behavior, or malware. It appears safe and legitimate.",
