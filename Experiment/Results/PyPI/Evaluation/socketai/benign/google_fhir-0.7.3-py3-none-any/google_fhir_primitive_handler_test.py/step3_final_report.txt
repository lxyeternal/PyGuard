{
  "purpose": "The code defines abstract test classes for validating and testing FHIR primitive_handler modules, focusing on validation, parsing, and formatting of primitive data types.",
  "sources": "Test data files (both protos and JSON), data validation routines, and primitive handler methods.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration; data validation and parsing are confined within the test environment.",
  "flows": "Test data loaded from files -> validation functions invoked -> validation results checked or exceptions raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing framework for FHIR primitive data types, involving data loading, validation, and formatting routines. It uses external test data files and validation methods without any system modifications, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The code's purpose is solely validation, and it operates within a controlled testing environment. The scores assigned should reflect its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign testing suite for FHIR primitive data validation. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The test data handling and validation routines are typical for such systems, and there are no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
