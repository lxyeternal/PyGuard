{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and an abstract base class for reporting FHIR-related errors, along with a concrete implementation that logs errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; code defines classes and methods for error reporting.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions (`logging.error`, `logging.warning`) that output error and warning messages.",
  "flows": "Errors and warnings are logged via the logging module, which could potentially output untrusted data if error messages contain user input or untrusted data (not apparent here).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present. The code is straightforward, focusing on error reporting infrastructure.",
  "analysis": "The code provides error reporting classes for FHIR data validation and conversion processes, with a logging mechanism to record errors and warnings. It uses abstract methods to enforce implementation in subclasses and a concrete class that logs and stores messages. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. All functions serve standard error handling purposes in a healthcare data context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of error reporting classes for FHIR validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely structural and utilitarian, with no malicious payloads or sabotage evident.",
