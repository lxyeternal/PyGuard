{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exceptions and an abstract base class for error reporting related to FHIR data validation and conversion, along with a concrete implementation that logs errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data sources are read within this code).",
  "sinks": "Logging functions (`logging.error`, `logging.warning`) that output messages; no external data sinks or exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process external or untrusted data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code strictly defines classes and methods related to error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises class definitions for error reporting, including an abstract base class with unimplemented methods and a concrete subclass that logs messages. There are no input sources, data processing, or external sinks involving untrusted data. The logging is standard and safe. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of error reporting for FHIR data validation, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
