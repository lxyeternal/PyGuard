{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and an abstract base class for FHIR error reporting, with a concrete implementation that logs errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "Error reporting methods invoked with specific element paths and messages; logging functions used for output.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to console or log files; internal message lists storing errors and warnings.",
  "flows": "Error/warning methods called with input data (element paths, messages) leading to logging and storage actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data handling; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard error reporting framework with abstract classes and a concrete logger implementation. It does not process external data or perform network operations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of logging and internal message lists is typical for such utilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given its benign, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured error reporting utility for FHIR validation, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are accurate and consistent with its purpose.",
