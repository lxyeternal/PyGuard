{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and an error reporting framework for handling FHIR-specific validation and conversion errors.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries (`abc`, `typing`, `logging`) and class methods that handle error reporting.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs and appending error/warning messages to internal lists.",
  "flows": "Error methods log messages and store them in internal lists; no data flows from external sources to sinks directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; code is straightforward and adheres to typical patterns for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a structured error reporting system with abstract classes and a concrete implementation that logs errors and warnings. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The usage of logging and internal lists is standard for such frameworks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors are evident. The classes are designed for error management in FHIR data processing, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard error handling framework for FHIR data validation. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It functions solely as an internal utility for error reporting and logging within a larger system.",
