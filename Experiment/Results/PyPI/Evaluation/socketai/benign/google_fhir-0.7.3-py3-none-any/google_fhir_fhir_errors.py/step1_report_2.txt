{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception and error reporting classes for handling FHIR data validation, encoding, and validation warnings.",
  "sources": "User input or external data through method calls like report_conversion_error, report_validation_error, report_validation_warning, report_fhir_path_error, report_fhir_path_warning.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions (logging.error, logging.warning) which output error and warning messages; errors and warnings are stored in internal lists.",
  "flows": "External data (e.g., element_path, message, constraints) are passed to reporting methods, which log and store messages; no data flows from untrusted sources into dangerous sinks like system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code is a standard implementation of error reporting with proper abstraction. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes and a concrete implementation for error reporting related to FHIR data processing. It uses standard Python features such as abc (Abstract Base Classes), type annotations, and logging. No external inputs are directly processed, nor are there any system commands, network calls, or file manipulations. The functions are purely for error handling and logging, with no evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior. The structure and format are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured error reporting module for FHIR processing with no malicious intent or security risks. It only logs and stores error/warning messages related to data validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware.",
