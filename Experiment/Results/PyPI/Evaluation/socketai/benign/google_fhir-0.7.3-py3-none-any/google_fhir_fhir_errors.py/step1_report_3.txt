{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and an abstract base class for handling FHIR-specific validation and encoding errors, along with a concrete implementation that logs and stores errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (abc, typing, logging). No external or user input data reading present.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions which could output error or warning messages.",
  "flows": "Error reporting methods receive error/warning messages and log them, then store them in internal lists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of standard logging and abstract class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a framework for error reporting related to FHIR data validation and conversion, including an abstract class and a concrete implementation that logs errors and warnings. It does not process external inputs or perform network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The use of logging is standard for debugging or audit purposes. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a clean, typical utility module for error reporting in a healthcare data processing context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for managing FHIR data validation errors with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard Python libraries and common design patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
