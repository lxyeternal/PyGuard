{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for comparing version strings, including handling epochs and release segments, and a class for version-aware string comparison.",
  "sources": "Input sources are limited to function parameters ('version1', 'version2') and internal regex matches; no external data input or network activity is present.",
  "sinks": "Comparison operations and string manipulations; no data leaks, external system calls, or insecure handling of untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "Version strings are parsed and compared internally through recursive functions, with no external data flow or untrusted data being sent or received.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard version comparison logic with support for epochs and release segments. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, is observed. The cmp function fallback and regex usage are standard and safe. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of version string comparison supporting epochs, release segments, and numeric/alpha groups. It avoids insecure operations, uses regex appropriately, and performs no external or system-modifying actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The overall structure and logic are consistent with a standard version comparison utility, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured version comparison utility with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for use in supply chain contexts, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
