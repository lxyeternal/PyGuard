{
  "purpose": "Provide version comparison utilities for software version strings, including support for epochs and release segments.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input or external data sources; it operates solely on provided string arguments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems, network, or stores sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as there are no source-to-sink data flows; the functions operate on input parameters only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code primarily focuses on version string parsing and comparison, using regular expressions and standard control structures.",
  "analysis": "The code implements version string comparison functions, handling epoch prefixes, release parts, and numeric/alphabetic components. It uses regular expressions to parse epochs and release segments. No external data is read, nor is there any code that sends data over networks or performs unauthorized actions. The logic appears consistent with standard version comparison algorithms. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign implementation of version comparison logic, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or system modifications. Overall, the code appears safe and solely focused on version string handling.",
