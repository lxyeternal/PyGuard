{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility for comparing version strings, supporting epochs, release segments, and alphanumeric components to determine version ordering.",
  "sources": "The code reads input version strings passed as function parameters; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data handling; the code operates solely on input parameters without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "The functions compare input version strings through internal parsing and comparison functions, with no external data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is a straightforward implementation of version comparison with standard regex and comparison logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a comprehensive version comparison utility, handling epochs, release parts, and alphanumeric segments. It uses regex for parsing and custom comparison functions. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is standard and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version comparison utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
