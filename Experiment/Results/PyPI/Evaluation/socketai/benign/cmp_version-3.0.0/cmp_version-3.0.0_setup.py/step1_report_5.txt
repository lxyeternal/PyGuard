{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'cmp_version' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description, environment variables for current working directory.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading file content and passing static package metadata to setup function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup configuration, changing the working directory if necessary, reading a README file for long description, and calling setuptools.setup() with static parameters. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network operations, and no code that could be used maliciously. The only file read is a static README.rst, and all data used in setup is predefined or static. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
