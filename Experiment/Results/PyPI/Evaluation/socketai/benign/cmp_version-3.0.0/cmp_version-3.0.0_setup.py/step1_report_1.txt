{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up and install a Python package called 'cmp_version' used for comparing version numbers.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.rst' file for long description; no other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could leak data or execute code based on untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is reading a file ('README.rst') for descriptive content, which is then used in package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: adjusting the working directory, reading a README file for description, and calling setuptools.setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is observed. It avoids complex logic and external inputs beyond the README file, which is a common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
