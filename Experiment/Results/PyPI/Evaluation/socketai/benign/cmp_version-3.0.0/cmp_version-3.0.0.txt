      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate automation tool for testing workflows but relies on fetching and executing external code without validation, introducing moderate security risk. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The existing scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.4). To improve security, code signing or checksum verification should be implemented for downloaded scripts, and deprecated modules should be replaced with modern alternatives."

The appropriate security risk score is around 0.8, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0. The primary recommendation is to refactor the subprocess call to prevent injection, such as passing arguments as a list or sanitizing inputs."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign version comparison test suite with a notable security vulnerability in the subprocess invocation due to unsanitized command-line inputs and use of shell=True. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary concern is the potential for command injection if inputs are malicious. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.6). Implementing safer subprocess practices will mitigate this risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign but demonstrates a significant security vulnerability in how it constructs and executes shell commands with untrusted inputs. All reports correctly identify this flaw, and the scores are consistent with the severity of the command injection risk. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, while the risk score should be around 0.75 to reflect the potential for exploitation. The primary recommendation is to refactor the subprocess call to eliminate the command injection vulnerability."
