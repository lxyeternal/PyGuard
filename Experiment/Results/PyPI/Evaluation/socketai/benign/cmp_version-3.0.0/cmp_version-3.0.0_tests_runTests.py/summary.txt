  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate automation tool for testing workflows but relies on fetching and executing external code without validation, introducing moderate security risk. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The existing scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.4). To improve security, code signing or checksum verification should be implemented for downloaded scripts, and deprecated modules should be replaced with modern alternatives."
