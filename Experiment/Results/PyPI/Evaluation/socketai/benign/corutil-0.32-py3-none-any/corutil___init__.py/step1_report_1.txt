  "purpose": "The code is designed to print 'hello!!!' when executed as a standalone script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's execution context to determine if it's run as the main program.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only performs a print operation.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking if __name__ == '__main__' and then executing print().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code checks whether it is executed as the main program, then prints a greeting message. There are no external data inputs, no sensitive data handling, no network connections, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a simple placeholder or test script. Its structure is standard and unremarkable.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign and simple script intended to print a message when run directly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
