  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that prints 'hello!!!' when executed directly.",
  "sources": "The __main__ check and the print statement.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from the main check to the print statement; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python script with no external inputs, network activity, or malicious patterns. It performs a benign print operation when run directly. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
