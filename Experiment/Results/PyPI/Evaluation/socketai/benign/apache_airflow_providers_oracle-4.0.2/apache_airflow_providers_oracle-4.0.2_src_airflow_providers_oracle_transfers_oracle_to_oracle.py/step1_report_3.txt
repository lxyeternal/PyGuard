  "purpose": "Data transfer between two Oracle databases using SQL queries within an Airflow task.",
  "sources": "Reading SQL query and parameters from 'source_sql' and 'source_sql_params'.",
  "sinks": "Executing SQL query on source database; inserting data into destination table via 'bulk_insert_rows'.",
  "flows": "source_sql and source_sql_params → cursor.execute → fetchmany → bulk_insert_rows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity. Usage of templated SQL and parameters is standard for Airflow operators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Airflow operator for moving data from one Oracle database to another. It uses standard hooks and connection IDs, and executes provided SQL with parameters. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The execution flow involves executing a query, fetching chunks of rows, and inserting them into another database, which is typical for data pipeline tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured data transfer operator for Apache Airflow, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data transfer operator for Oracle databases in Airflow. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, with no suspicious activities detected.",
