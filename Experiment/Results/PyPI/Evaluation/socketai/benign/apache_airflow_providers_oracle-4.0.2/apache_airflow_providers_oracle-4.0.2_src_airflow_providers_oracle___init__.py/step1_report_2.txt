{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an automatically generated configuration or version check file for an Apache Airflow provider package, primarily intended to verify environment compatibility and specify package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the imported Airflow version from the airflow module and the package version string '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the airflow version information to perform a version comparison and potentially raises an exception if the environment does not meet requirements.",
  "flows": "The airflow version is fetched and parsed; if it is below 2.9.0, a RuntimeError is raised, which halts execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. The version check and import statements are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of version information, a version comparison, and raises an exception if the environment does not meet the specified requirements. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. It is a typical version validation script generated automatically for package compatibility checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check script for package compatibility with Apache Airflow. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are identified. It is designed solely for validation purposes.",
