  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code snippets: auto-generated package initialization scripts for Apache Airflow providers.\n- The code performs version checks against the Airflow environment, raising RuntimeError if the version is below 2.9.0.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The logic is straightforward, standard, and typical for dependency validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports correctly identify the code as boilerplate, auto-generated, and standard for dependency/version validation.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None identified. The version check is correctly implemented using `packaging.version.parse` and raises an error if the environment does not meet the minimum requirement.\n- **Security flaws:** None. The code does not process untrusted data, handle secrets, or perform any network operations.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward, generated nature of the code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of security issues.\n\n### Risk score justification:\n- The overall **risk score** is 0, which is justified. The code enforces version compatibility without any security concerns.\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- The reports assume the code is purely boilerplate and safe, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are unjustified.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is standard, generated boilerplate for dependency management.\n- No further security concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores—no changes needed.",
