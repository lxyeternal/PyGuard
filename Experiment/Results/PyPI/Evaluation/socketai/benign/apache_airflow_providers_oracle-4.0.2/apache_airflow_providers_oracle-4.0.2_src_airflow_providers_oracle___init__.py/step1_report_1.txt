  "purpose": "Define package version and enforce compatibility with specific Apache Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version variables, and conditional version check logic.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Imports and version comparison leading to a RuntimeError if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and generated, with no unusual or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, sets version information, and performs a version check against the installed Airflow version. If the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError with a specific message. The code is standard, boilerplate, and generated, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, generated package initialization script for version management and compatibility enforcement. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
