{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an auto-generated initialization file for an Apache Airflow provider package, setting version information and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`from __future__ import annotations`, `import packaging.version`, `from airflow import __version__ as airflow_version`), and the `__version__` variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "The only potentially sensitive operation is the version comparison and the conditional raise of a RuntimeError.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing Airflow version, parsing it, and raising an error if version criteria are not met. No untrusted data is involved in these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and includes standard version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and the airflow version, defines a version string, and raises an error if the installed Airflow version is below 2.9.0. The logic is simple and intended for compatibility enforcement. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code's structure and comments indicate it is part of a build or deployment process, not a malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated configuration file intended for version validation of the Airflow environment. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
