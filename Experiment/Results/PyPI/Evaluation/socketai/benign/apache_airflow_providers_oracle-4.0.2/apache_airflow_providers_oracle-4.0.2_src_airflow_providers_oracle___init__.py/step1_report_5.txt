{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated initialization file for an Apache Airflow provider package, mainly for setting the package version and validating the Airflow version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported modules `packaging.version` and the `__version__` attribute of `airflow`.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the code only performs version checks and raises exceptions.",
  "flows": "The code parses the Airflow version, compares it to a minimum required version, and potentially raises an exception if the requirement is not met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors are present; the code follows a standard pattern for version validation and package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines package version, and performs a version check on the installed Airflow version. If the version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious operations. It is an auto-generated file with comments indicating it is template-based. No hardcoded secrets or external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard auto-generated package initializer with version validation logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this code snippet.",
