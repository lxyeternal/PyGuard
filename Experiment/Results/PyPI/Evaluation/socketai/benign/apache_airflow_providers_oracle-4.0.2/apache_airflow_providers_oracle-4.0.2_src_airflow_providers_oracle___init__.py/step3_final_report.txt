  "purpose": "Enforce minimum required version of Apache Airflow (>=2.9.0) and prevent incompatible environments.",
  "sources": "Imports 'airflow.__version__' and 'packaging.version' for version comparison.",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, halting execution.",
  "flows": "Imports version, compares 'airflow.__version__' with '2.9.0', triggers exception on failure.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant parsing of 'packaging.version.parse' applied twice; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated dependency validation script. It imports necessary modules, defines a version string, and performs a version comparison to ensure environment compatibility. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The version check is a standard practice, and the exception raising is expected behavior. The code's purpose is to prevent runtime errors due to incompatible versions, not to perform any malicious actions. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated dependency check script with no malicious intent or security risks. It enforces version requirements in a standard manner without any suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
