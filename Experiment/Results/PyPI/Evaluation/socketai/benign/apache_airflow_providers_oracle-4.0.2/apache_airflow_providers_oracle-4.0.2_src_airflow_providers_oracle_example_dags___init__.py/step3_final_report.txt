  "purpose": "This code is a standard license header comment from the Apache Software Foundation, containing licensing information and legal notices.",
  "sources": "The code source is a comment block at the beginning of a file, containing license text.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code contains only comments with no data processing or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist as there is no executable code; the comment is static and does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or embedded malicious code are present; the content is a typical license header.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a license comment with no executable statements, data flows, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified. The confidence level is high (1), and there are no anomalies or issues. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard license header comment with no malicious or suspicious content. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary.",
