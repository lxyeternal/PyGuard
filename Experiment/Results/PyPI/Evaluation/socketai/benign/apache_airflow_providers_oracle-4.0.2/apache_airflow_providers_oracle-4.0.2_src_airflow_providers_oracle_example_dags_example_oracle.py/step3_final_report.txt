  "purpose": "Defines an Airflow DAG with two tasks executing an Oracle stored procedure with static parameters.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded parameters within the DAG tasks, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Execution of stored procedures with fixed parameters; no untrusted data flows or leaks.",
  "flows": "Static parameters directly passed to the OracleStoredProcedureOperator; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, straightforward Airflow DAG setup executing Oracle stored procedures with static parameters. No external input, network activity, or secrets are involved. The parameters are hardcoded, but they are benign and typical for example or template code. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or code modification is necessary.",
