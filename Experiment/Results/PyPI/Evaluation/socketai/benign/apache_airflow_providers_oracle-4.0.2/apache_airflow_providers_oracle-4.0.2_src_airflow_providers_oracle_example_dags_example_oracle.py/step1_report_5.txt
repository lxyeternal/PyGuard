{
  "purpose": "The code defines an Apache Airflow DAG that schedules and manages tasks involving Oracle stored procedures.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters for the DAG and parameters for Oracle stored procedures.",
  "sinks": "The stored procedure calls could potentially be sensitive if parameters are manipulated, but no external untrusted data is directly used.",
  "flows": "Parameters are passed to OracleStoredProcedureOperator; no external data flows or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. Usage of standard libraries, no hardcoded credentials beyond connection IDs, which are typical in Airflow.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Airflow DAG setup with two stored procedure tasks. It imports necessary modules, sets up DAG configuration, and creates two operators with parameters. No external input, untrusted data, or suspicious behaviors are observed. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The parameters are hardcoded, but they are typical for such configurations, not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Airflow DAG configuration for Oracle stored procedures with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
