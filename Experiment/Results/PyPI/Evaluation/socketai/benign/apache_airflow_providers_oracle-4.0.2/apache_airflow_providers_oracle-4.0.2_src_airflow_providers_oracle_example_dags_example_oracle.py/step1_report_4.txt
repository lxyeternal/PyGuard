  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG that executes Oracle stored procedures with specific input/output parameters.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters for the DAG and OracleStoredProcedureOperator, including task IDs, connection ID, procedure name, and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of stored procedures on an Oracle database with parameters that could influence database behavior.",
  "flows": "DAG setup → creation of OracleStoredProcedureOperator tasks → execution of stored procedures with provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond connection ID, no unusual or obfuscated code, no network or data exfiltration indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an Airflow DAG with two tasks executing the same stored procedure with different parameter formats (list and dict). The parameters appear to be simple integers and type hints. No user input handling, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The stored procedures and parameters are straightforward and standard for database operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code relies on external configurations (connection ID 'oracle'), which is typical and not suspicious. Overall, the script appears to be a normal orchestration of database tasks using Airflow, with no indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Airflow DAG setup for executing Oracle stored procedures with predefined parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and purposefully designed for scheduled database interactions.",
