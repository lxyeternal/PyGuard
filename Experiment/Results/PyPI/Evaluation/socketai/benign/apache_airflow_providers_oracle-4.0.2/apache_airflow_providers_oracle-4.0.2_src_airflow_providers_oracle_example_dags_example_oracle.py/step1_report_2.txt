  "purpose": "Define an Apache Airflow DAG that executes Oracle stored procedures with specified input and output parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for stored procedures, such as the list [3, int] and the dictionary {'val_in': 3, 'val_out': int}.",
  "sinks": "Execution of Oracle stored procedures via the OracleStoredProcedureOperator; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to the OracleStoredProcedureOperator which executes the procedures. No external untrusted data flows into the code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external network interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Airflow DAG definition that schedules and runs Oracle stored procedures with provided parameters. It imports necessary modules, defines DAG parameters, and sets up two tasks invoking stored procedures with fixed input values. There is no indication of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. No sensitive information or external network calls are present. The structure and logic follow standard practices for Airflow DAGs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal implementation of an Airflow DAG for executing Oracle stored procedures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code snippet.",
