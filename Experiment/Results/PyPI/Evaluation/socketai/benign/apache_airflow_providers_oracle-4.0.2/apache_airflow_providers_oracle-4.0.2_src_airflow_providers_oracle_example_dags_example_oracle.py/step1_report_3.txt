{
  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG that executes Oracle stored procedures with specified input and output parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for the DAG and procedure parameters from hardcoded values within the script.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; the code interfaces with an Oracle database via Airflow operators.",
  "flows": "The DAG setup flows from configuration to task instantiation, with parameters passed directly into OracleStoredProcedureOperator instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of standard Airflow and Oracle libraries appears normal. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Airflow DAG definition for executing Oracle stored procedures. It imports necessary modules, defines a DAG with specific parameters, and creates two tasks invoking the same procedure with different parameter formats. No untrusted data sources or dynamic code execution present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code is straightforward and appears intended for legitimate data pipeline orchestration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Airflow DAG for scheduling Oracle stored procedures. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. No suspicious signals or anomalies were detected.",
