  "purpose": "This code provides static metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-oracle' package, including versions, dependencies, and integration info.",
  "sources": "The function get_provider_info() returns a hardcoded dictionary; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, such as network or file operations, are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the function simply returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. It is auto-generated metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning a predefined dictionary with package info. It contains no input handling, external data processing, or malicious logic. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The purpose is purely informational, serving as package metadata. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, aligning with the code's benign and static nature. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated metadata provider with no security concerns. It poses no malware risk, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
