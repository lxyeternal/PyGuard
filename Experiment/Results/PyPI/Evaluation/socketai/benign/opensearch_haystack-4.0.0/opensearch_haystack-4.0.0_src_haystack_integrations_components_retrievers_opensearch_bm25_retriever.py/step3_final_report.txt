{
  "purpose": "Provides a BM25-based document retrieval from OpenSearch, configurable with filters, fuzziness, and custom queries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (query, filters, custom_query), external document store API (_bm25_retrieval/_bm25_retrieval_async).",
  "sinks": "Logs warnings on errors; no external data exfiltration or system commands.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow into _prepare_bm25_args, then to document store retrieval methods; exceptions are logged or raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; relies on trusted API methods; no malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a BM25 retriever component, delegating retrieval to trusted external API methods. Exception handling is standard, with logging or raising exceptions. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The parameters are well-managed, and the code structure is clear. External API reliance is typical for such components, and no suspicious data flows or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The external API calls are assumed to be trusted. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The low security risk score is justified given the benign nature and proper handling.",
