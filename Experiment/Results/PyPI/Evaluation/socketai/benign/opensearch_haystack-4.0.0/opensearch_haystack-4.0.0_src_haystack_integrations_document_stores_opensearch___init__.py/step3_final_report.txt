{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal module that imports the 'OpenSearchDocumentStore' class from a local module and exposes it via '__all__' for package API purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements and license comments; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process runtime data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static import and export operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module that imports a class and exposes it, with license comments. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident or implied. The code's simplicity and standard structure confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export with no security issues or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
