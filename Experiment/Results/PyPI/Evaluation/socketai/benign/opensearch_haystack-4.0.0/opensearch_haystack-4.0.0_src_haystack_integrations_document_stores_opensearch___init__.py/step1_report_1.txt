  "purpose": "This code appears to define the interface for exporting the OpenSearchDocumentStore class from a module related to document storage.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the imported module '.document_store' which provides the OpenSearchDocumentStore class.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. The code only exports a class name.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and sets the export list. There are no inputs, outputs, or runtime behaviors beyond module import/export. No security issues or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of a larger package to expose the OpenSearchDocumentStore class.",
