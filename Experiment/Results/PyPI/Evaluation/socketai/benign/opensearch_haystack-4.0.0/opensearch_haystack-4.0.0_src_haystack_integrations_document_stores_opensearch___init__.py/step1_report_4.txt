{
  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports and exposes the OpenSearchDocumentStore class for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statement and the __all__ declaration, which are static and do not process external input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data output points that handle untrusted input or perform data leakage.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code simply imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only a straightforward import of a class from a local module and defining an export list. No runtime data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are visible. The presence of SPDX license identifiers and copyright information indicates adherence to licensing standards but does not imply malicious intent. The code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file to facilitate package exports.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. It is a standard, benign module initialization file that merely exports a class for use elsewhere.",
