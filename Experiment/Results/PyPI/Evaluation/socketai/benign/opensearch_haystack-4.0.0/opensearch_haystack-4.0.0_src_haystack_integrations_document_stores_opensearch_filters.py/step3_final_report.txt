{
  "purpose": "This code converts user-defined filters into OpenSearch query DSL, performing validation and normalization to ensure correct query formation.",
  "sources": "Input filter dictionaries provided by the user, including fields, operators, and values.",
  "sinks": "Constructed query dictionaries used to query OpenSearch; no external or untrusted code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Input filters are validated, parsed, and transformed into query components through comparison and logical condition functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, including type checks and exception handling for date strings. It uses standard comparison functions mapped in a dictionary, ensuring safe and predictable query construction. No external calls, network activity, or code injection points are present. The logic for range normalization and logical conditions is clear and safe. The handling of 'meta.' prefix is benign. Overall, the code is a standard utility for filter translation with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured filter parser and converter for OpenSearch queries. It performs validation and normalization without executing untrusted code or handling sensitive data maliciously. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting cautious input validation but no actual threat.",
