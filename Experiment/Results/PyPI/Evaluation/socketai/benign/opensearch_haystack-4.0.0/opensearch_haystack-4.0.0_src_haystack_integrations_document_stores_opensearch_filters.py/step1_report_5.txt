{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to parse and convert user-defined filters into Elasticsearch/OpenSearch query formats, supporting logical and comparison operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'filters' in 'normalize_filters', and dictionaries within 'condition' and 'comparison' structures in helper functions.",
  "sinks": "Constructed query dictionaries that would be used to query a database; no direct data leak or system access points are present.",
  "flows": "Input filter data flows through parsing functions, converting into query dicts; no untrusted data is executed or evaluated as code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. Functions perform standard validation and transformation. No suspicious obfuscation or uncommon language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input filters, converting them into query formats compatible with OpenSearch/Elasticsearch. It handles comparison operators, logical operators, and range merging with proper validation. No code injection, remote code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. It performs data validation (e.g., date parsing) and raises exceptions for invalid input, but does not process or execute untrusted code. The functions are well-structured and include appropriate error handling. There are no signs of malware, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be a standard filter parser/translator with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward filter parsing utility with proper validation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It is safe and intended for converting user filters into search query structures.",
