{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to parse, normalize, and convert filter conditions into OpenSearch query syntax, supporting logical and comparison operations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'filters' dictionary passed to 'normalize_filters', and individual condition dictionaries within parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code constructs query dictionaries for OpenSearch based on input conditions.",
  "flows": "Input filters -> Validation and parsing functions -> Construction of query dicts (e.g., term, range, bool) -> Returned as normalized query structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The functions perform expected query translations without hidden or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or code injection points present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly converts filter conditions into Elasticsearch/OpenSearch-compatible query DSL objects. It validates input structure, raises errors on invalid input, and constructs query components accordingly. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoor logic. The code's operations are limited to data validation and query building. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected. The use of standard libraries and clear control flow supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a benign utility for translating filter conditions into OpenSearch query formats. It performs validation, normalization, and query construction without any malicious behavior or backdoors. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
