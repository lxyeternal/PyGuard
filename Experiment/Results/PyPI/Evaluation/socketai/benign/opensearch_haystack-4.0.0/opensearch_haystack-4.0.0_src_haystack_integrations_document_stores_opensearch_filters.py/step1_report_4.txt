{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse and convert filter conditions into OpenSearch query formats, primarily for filtering documents based on various criteria.",
  "sources": "Input filters passed to the 'normalize_filters' function, which can come from user input or application data.",
  "sinks": "Generated Elasticsearch/OpenSearch query dictionaries that are used to filter data in a database.",
  "flows": "Input filters -> parsing functions (_parse_logical_condition, _parse_comparison_condition) -> comparison operator functions (_equal, _not_equal, etc.) -> output query dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of standard library functions and common filtering logic. No code injection, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs validation and transformation of filter conditions into query formats compatible with OpenSearch. It carefully handles various operators and data types, raising errors on invalid inputs. There is no code that interacts with external systems, performs network operations, or handles sensitive data beyond filtering logic. The functions are designed for safe data filtering with proper input validation and error handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard and safe implementation of filter parsing and transformation logic for OpenSearch queries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code’s purpose is clearly related to query building, with proper validation to prevent misuse. Overall, it is secure and suitable for use in a search/filtering context.",
