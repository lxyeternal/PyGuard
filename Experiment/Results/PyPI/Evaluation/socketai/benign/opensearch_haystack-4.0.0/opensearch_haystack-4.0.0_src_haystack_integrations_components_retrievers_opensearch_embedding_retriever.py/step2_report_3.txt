  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of the component, highlighting input parameters and data flow.\n- **Sinks:** Notes that the document store methods could execute queries or code, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of 'custom_query' is for user flexibility, not malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard, with proper validation and no malicious activity. The malware score is rightly 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Score Justification:** The report's conclusion and the low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar accurate description.\n- **Sinks:** Potential data leak if inputs are mishandled, but no actual leakage occurs here.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The use of internal methods is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior, low security risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** The malware score remains 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the data flow.\n- **Sinks:** External method calls could be a concern if the methods are malicious, but this is outside the scope of this code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. The templated 'custom_query' is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, low risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** The malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Well described.\n- **Sinks:** No data leaks or external transmission.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe component.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware score is 0, matching the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks:** Calls to internal methods, but these are expected.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, no signs of code injection or exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate component, no malware.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0.2, set at 0.2, which is reasonable given the potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code is a standard, well-structured component for embedding-based document retrieval, with no malicious or sabotage intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe security and malware scores are appropriate given the analysis. No changes are necessary.",
