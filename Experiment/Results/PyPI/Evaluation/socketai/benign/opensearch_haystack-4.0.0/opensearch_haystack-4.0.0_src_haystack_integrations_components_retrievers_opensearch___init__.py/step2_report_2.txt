  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Structure:**\n   - The code is a typical Python module, likely an `__init__.py`, that imports specific classes from local modules and declares them in `__all__` for export.\n   - It contains SPDX license comments, which are standard for open source projects.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, file operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The imported classes (`OpenSearchBM25Retriever`, `OpenSearchEmbeddingRetriever`) are presumably defined elsewhere within the package.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n   - No data sinks, external network calls, or execution of untrusted data.\n   - The code is purely structural, setting up module exports.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward import/export pattern.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits that are unfounded.\n   - The purpose of the code aligns with typical package setup files.\n\n5. **Final Evaluation:**\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are all appropriately set to 0.\n   - No modifications are necessary; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The overall security posture of this code segment is very low risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- No further action or re-scoring is needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- Continue monitoring other parts of the package for any suspicious activity, but this specific code segment is benign.",
