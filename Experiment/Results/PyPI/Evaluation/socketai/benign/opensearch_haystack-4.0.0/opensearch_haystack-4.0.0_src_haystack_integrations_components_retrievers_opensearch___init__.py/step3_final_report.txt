{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing specific retriever classes and exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects, as the code performs no data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up class exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated constructs; it is a straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module, importing two classes and defining __all__ for export. It includes SPDX license comments and no operational logic. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py. Given its simplicity, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
