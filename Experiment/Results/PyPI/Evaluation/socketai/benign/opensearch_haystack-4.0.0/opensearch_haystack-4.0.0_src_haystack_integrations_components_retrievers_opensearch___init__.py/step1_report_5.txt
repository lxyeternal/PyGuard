  "purpose": "Exporting and defining public interface for retriever classes related to OpenSearch (BM25 and embedding retrievers).",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; imports modules and defines __all__ for export.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports two classes and specifies an export list. There are no data inputs, outputs, or transformations. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security issues detected. The module appears to serve as an interface for retriever components. The structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module that exports retriever classes for use elsewhere. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
