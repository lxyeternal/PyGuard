{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface of a package by specifying imports from local modules related to retrievers, likely for information retrieval tasks.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules '.bm25_retriever' and '.embedding_retriever', which are local files in the package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks or places where untrusted data could be leaked or executed; it mainly exports classes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares what symbols are publicly available.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; the code consists solely of import statements, license information, and an __all__ declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code includes SPDX license identifiers and imports two retriever classes, then defines __all__ for module exports. There are no inputs, data processing, or execution logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign module that sets up package exports with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
