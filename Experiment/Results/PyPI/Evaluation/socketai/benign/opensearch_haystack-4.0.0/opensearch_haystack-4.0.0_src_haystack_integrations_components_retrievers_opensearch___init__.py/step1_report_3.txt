{
  "purpose": "This code module defines and exports two classes, OpenSearchBM25Retriever and OpenSearchEmbeddingRetriever, likely for use in information retrieval tasks related to OpenSearch.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing specific classes from local modules: .bm25_retriever and .embedding_retriever",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this code",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code segment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; the code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes and sets an export list. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or contain dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no hardcoded credentials, and no external network activity.\nOverall, this is a simple module setup with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module index or interface for retriever classes. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
