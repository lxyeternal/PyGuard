{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports two classes related to retrieval mechanisms, likely for information retrieval tasks, from local modules within the package.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from local modules (.bm25_retriever and .embedding_retriever).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data or actions such as network communication, file writing, or execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present; the code only imports and exports class names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of SPDX licensing comments, followed by imports of specific classes from internal modules, and an __all__ declaration to specify exported symbols. No input handling, no data processing, no network or system commands, nor any dynamic code execution is present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file, indicating an organized package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exposes certain classes, with no external data handling or suspicious logic.",
