  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports two classes (`OpenSearchBM25Retriever` and `OpenSearchEmbeddingRetriever`) from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- It includes SPDX license identifiers and no other logic, data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code structure is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or module index file.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious code, or security issues. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute untrusted code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that this is a simple module setup.\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n### Score Evaluation:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature. Since the code is purely import/export with no suspicious activity, the scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a high risk score. The code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Malware Score:\n- All reports correctly assign malware = 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### Assumptions and Claims:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as benign.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a standard package interface setup with no security risks.\n- The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues. The scores assigned in all reports are accurate and justified.",
