  "purpose": "Implementation of synchronous and asynchronous pagers for iterating through 'list_usable_subnetworks' API responses, handling pagination transparently.",
  "sources": "Request object, response object, and the API method callable; reads request parameters and response data.",
  "sinks": "Yields subnetworks from response; no external or untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Request object is used to fetch subsequent pages based on 'next_page_token'; response data flows into the iterator yielding subnetworks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard pagination classes for Google Cloud API responses, wrapping API calls with logic to handle 'next_page_token' for multiple pages. Both sync and async versions are implemented following typical patterns. No external data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The use of API method calls and response handling aligns with standard SDK practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of API response pagination classes, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
