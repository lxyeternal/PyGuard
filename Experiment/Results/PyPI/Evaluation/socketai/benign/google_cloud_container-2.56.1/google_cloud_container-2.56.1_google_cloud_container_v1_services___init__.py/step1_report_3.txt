{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and copyright header, likely part of a larger Python module or script.",
  "sources": "The source is the comment block at the beginning of the file containing license information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling, I/O, or executable code present.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable, as the code only contains comments and licensing information.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains only licensing comments with no executable code, which is unusual if considered in isolation but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is solely a license header with no executable statements, functions, or data handling. There are no sources of input, no sinks, and no flow of data or commands. Since it lacks any runtime code, malicious behavior or security risks cannot be inferred. This appears to be a standard license comment block typically found at the top of source files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is just a license header with no executable or data-processing components. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues. The presence of only comments suggests it is benign and part of a larger project.",
