  "purpose": "This code is a module that imports and exports classes and functions related to Google Cloud's Kubernetes Engine (GKE) management client library, providing a public API for interacting with GKE clusters.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.container and google.cloud.container_v1.types modules, specifically various classes and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data, nor any data leak points.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules and re-exports symbols; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and functions from a Google Cloud client library and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. The licensing comments are standard, and no runtime or malicious logic is present. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal. The structure and content are typical for SDK or client library packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library module for Google Cloud GKE client SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves as a public API surface and contains no malicious or suspicious code.",
