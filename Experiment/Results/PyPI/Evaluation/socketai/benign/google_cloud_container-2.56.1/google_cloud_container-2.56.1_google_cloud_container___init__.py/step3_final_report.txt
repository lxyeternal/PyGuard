{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer or module that imports and re-exports classes, constants, and types from the Google Cloud Container SDK for GKE, facilitating easier access for users.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static import statements of SDK modules and version info; no untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is handled or where data could leak; the code only exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code is purely structural with static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is standard SDK setup with licensing headers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK module that imports classes and constants from google.cloud.container and related modules, then re-exports them via __all__. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for a package __init__ file intended to simplify imports. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected. The code is static, well-structured, and adheres to standard SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK package initializer with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. It simply exposes SDK classes for user convenience, with no evidence of supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
