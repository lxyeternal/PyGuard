  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as no executable code is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior are present; the code is a standard license header with version info.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments, licensing information, and a version string. There are no functions, data processing, or executable statements. The license and copyright comments are standard and do not contain any suspicious or malicious content. The version string is a typical assignment for package versioning. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard license and metadata header with no malicious intent or security concerns. The code is safe and contains no suspicious or harmful elements.",
