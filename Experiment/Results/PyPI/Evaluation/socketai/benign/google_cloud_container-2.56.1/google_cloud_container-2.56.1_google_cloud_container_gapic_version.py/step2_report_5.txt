  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code snippet is purely a license, copyright, and version header.\n- It contains no executable code, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- The comments and version string are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Correctly identifies the code as benign metadata with no malicious content.  \n   - The confidence is high (1), and the malware score is 0.  \n   - No issues here.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Similar to Report 1, correctly notes the benign nature.  \n   - No suspicious patterns or anomalies.  \n   - Malware score remains 0.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Again, correctly classifies as a standard header.  \n   - No anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n   - Malware score is 0.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Consistent with previous assessments; no issues detected.  \n   - No security risks or malware.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Same conclusion: benign, standard metadata.  \n   - No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard license and version header with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scoring across all reports is consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in static license header)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThis is a safe, standard license header with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and accurate.",
