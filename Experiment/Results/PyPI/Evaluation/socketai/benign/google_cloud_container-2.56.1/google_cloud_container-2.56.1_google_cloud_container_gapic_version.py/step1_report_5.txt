{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header or metadata section for a Python source file, mainly containing licensing information, versioning, and encoding declarations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from its own comments and string literals for encoding and versioning.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external inputs or produce outputs with side effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a version string assignment, which are common in open-source files for licensing and versioning purposes. There are no functions, data processing, external input handling, or executable logic that could be exploited or malicious. The licensing comments are standard boilerplate, and the version string is a static assignment, not dynamically generated or retrieved from external sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard licensing and version header with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat and appears to be harmless documentation metadata.",
