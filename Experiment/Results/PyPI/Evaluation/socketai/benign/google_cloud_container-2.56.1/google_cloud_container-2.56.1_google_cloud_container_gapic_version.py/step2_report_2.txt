  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Nature**:\n   - The code is purely a set of comments containing licensing information, copyright, and a version string assignment.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external inputs, outputs, or executable logic.\n   - The version string `__version__ = \"2.56.1\"` is a standard practice for package versioning.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements**:\n   - No code constructs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No external data handling or network activity.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata, or licensing headers.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are noted.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), and all scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear, comments and static variables only.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risk, no vulnerabilities, no external data flows.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is only comments and a version string, there is no basis for any higher risk or malware scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard license and metadata header.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code present.\n- No security risks identified.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Keep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code fragment is entirely safe and typical for open-source projects.",
