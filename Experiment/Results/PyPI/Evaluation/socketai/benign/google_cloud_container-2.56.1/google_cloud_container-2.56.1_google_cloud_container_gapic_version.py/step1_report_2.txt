  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license and metadata header for a Python source file, likely part of a larger project or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines metadata and comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, a copyright statement, and a version variable assignment. It does not include any executable logic, input handling, or potentially dangerous operations. The presence of license text and versioning indicates standard practice for open-source modules. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign metadata header with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves as licensing and version information for a larger codebase.",
