  "purpose": "This code is a module for importing and exporting classes and functions related to Google Cloud's container management APIs, specifically for Kubernetes clusters.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.cloud.container_v1' package and local module references such as '.services.cluster_manager' and '.types.cluster_service'. No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to external sources or untrusted systems are present in this code. No network, file, or environment variable operations are performed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks, as the code primarily defines imports, constants, and export lists.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated segments, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is standard for a client library module, with clear licensing and versioning info.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, licensing comments, and an explicit list of all exported identifiers (__all__). It does not include executable logic, data processing, or interaction with external systems. It adheres to typical patterns for a Python client library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign library module meant to define imports and exports for a Google Cloud container management SDK. There are no indicators of malicious intent, suspicious data flows, or security risks.",
