  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a module importing classes from `google.cloud.container_v1` and local modules, with no external or untrusted data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data output or network activity; static imports only.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK module, benign, with no malicious indicators.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct. No malicious behavior detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct. No obfuscation.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — Correct. No risks identified.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard import/export setup for SDK classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirmed as a benign, boilerplate SDK module.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — Slightly above zero, but considering the static nature, this might be a conservative default or minor SDK metadata.  \n  *Given the absence of any actual security concern, this could be lowered to 0.*\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly high security risk score. I suggest lowering it to 0 for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—imports from a trusted package, no external data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or data output.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK setup, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — Again, slightly above zero, but no actual security concern.  \n  *Should be adjusted to 0.*\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score appears inflated; should be 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, setting up API surface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK module, safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — Correct, given the static nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—standard import/export module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK setup, benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a static, benign SDK module with no malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are all correctly zero.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly zero.\n- The security risk scores are slightly inflated in reports 2 and 3 (0.1), which should be adjusted to 0, as there is no actual security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the static, read-only nature of this code, with no dynamic execution, no data handling, no external network or file operations, and no obfuscation or secrets, **the overall malware and obfuscated scores should be 0**. The security risk score should also be 0, reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a typical, safe SDK module with no security concerns.",
