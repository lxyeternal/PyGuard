  "purpose": "The code appears to be a metadata header for a Python package, including licensing information and versioning details.",
  "sources": "The code sources include comments, licensing information, and version assignment.",
  "funnels": "There are no apparent input points or untrusted data sources; the code is static metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted data or source-to-sink paths; the code solely defines static information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior are present; the code consists of standard license comments and version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing comments, a version string assignment, and no executable logic. There are no input, output, or data processing components that could be exploited or malicious. The structure is typical for Python package metadata files. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as package metadata and licensing information with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
