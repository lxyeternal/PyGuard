  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata information for a Python package or module, including licensing, versioning, and copyright details.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations; only static metadata definitions.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code solely contains comments and a version variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behavior detected. The license information is standard, and the versioning is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a licensing header, licensing information, and a single variable assignment setting the __version__ attribute. There are no functions, no input/output operations, and no obfuscated or dynamic code. All elements are typical for package metadata files and contain no malicious or security-related concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata header for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply provides licensing and version information.",
