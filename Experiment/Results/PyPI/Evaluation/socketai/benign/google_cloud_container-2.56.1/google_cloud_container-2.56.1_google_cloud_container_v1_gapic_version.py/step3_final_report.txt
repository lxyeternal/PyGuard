  "purpose": "Metadata header containing licensing information and version identifier for a Python package/module.",
  "sources": "Comments with licensing and copyright notices, assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; static code with no input/output or data flow.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows or untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains only comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard header with licensing comments and a version string. It contains no functions, input/output, network calls, or dynamic code. The content is static and serves as package metadata. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature. The confidence score of 1 is justified. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata header with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
