{
  "purpose": "Registry setup for transport classes used in a client SDK for cluster management, importing transport implementations and registering them in an ordered dictionary.",
  "sources": "Static import statements and class references within the module; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static registration of class types.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; no obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static registry setup for transport classes, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity. It imports classes from local modules, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes symbols via __all__. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code is typical for SDK setup modules and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security concerns. All signals indicate a safe setup module with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
