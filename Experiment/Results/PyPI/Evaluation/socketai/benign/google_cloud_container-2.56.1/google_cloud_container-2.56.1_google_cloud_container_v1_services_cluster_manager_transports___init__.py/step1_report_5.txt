{
  "purpose": "Defines and registers various transport classes for ClusterManager, including gRPC, gRPC AsyncIO, and REST transports, for use in a larger client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from .base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, and .rest modules; hardcoded strings for registry keys and class names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations, no command execution, no environment variable use, no credential handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected; the code is mainly class and registry definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; uses standard library features and straightforward class registration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, creates a registry dictionary, assigns transport classes to specific keys, and defines __all__ for exports. All operations are static and involve no input/output or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module for registering transport classes in a client library. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
