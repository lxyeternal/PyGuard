{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for the ClusterManager component, including gRPC, async gRPC, and REST transports, for use in a client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest). Static assignments to the _transport_registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; the _transport_registry dictionary is populated with class references. No dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic evaluation. The code appears to be standard library setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local classes, sets up a dictionary to register transport classes, and exports relevant symbols. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is typical for a Python package defining transport options for a client library. All operations are static and straightforward, with no complex or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup module for registering transport classes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger client library.",
