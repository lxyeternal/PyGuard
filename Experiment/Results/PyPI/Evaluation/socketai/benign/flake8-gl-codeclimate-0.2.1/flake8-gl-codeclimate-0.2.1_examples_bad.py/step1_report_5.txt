  "purpose": "The script appears to be a simple command-line utility that prints the current working directory.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse (although incorrectly), reads the current working directory using os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to stdout; no other sinks are present",
  "flows": "Input via command-line arguments (although there's a typo), which are not used further; the flow from reading cwd to printing is straightforward and not malicious",
  "anomalies": "Typo in 'parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()' where 'parsre.parse_args()' should be 'parser.parse_args()'; the comment 'Some bad stuff.' is suspicious but non-functional; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and primarily prints the current working directory. The only suspicious aspect is the misspelling of 'parser.parse_args()' which would cause an exception and prevent execution. No data leakage, malicious activity, or obfuscated code is present. The overall logic is simple and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior. The typo prevents it from running as intended but does not introduce malicious risk. Overall, this appears to be a benign script with a minor bug.",
