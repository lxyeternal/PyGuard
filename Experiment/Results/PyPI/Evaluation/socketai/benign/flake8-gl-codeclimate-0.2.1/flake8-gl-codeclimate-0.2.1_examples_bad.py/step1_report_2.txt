  "purpose": "The script appears to be a simple utility that prints the current working directory.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from argparse (though unused), and retrieves current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output using print(), no sensitive data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "Input (command-line args) → no processing → output current directory.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in 'args = parsre.parse_args()' (should be 'parser.parse_args()') which causes an exception. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an argument parser but contains a typo preventing proper argument parsing. It simply prints the current working directory. No input is processed, no external network calls, no secrets or credentials are handled. The comment 'Some bad stuff.' is nonspecific and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility to print the current working directory, with a typo that causes an error. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The typo suggests potential incomplete or incorrect implementation but does not elevate the security concern.",
