  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that prints the current working directory.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command line arguments via argparse, and environment via os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via print()",
  "flows": "Command line arguments -> argparse parsing -> print(os.getcwd())",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in 'args = parsre.parse_args()' which should be 'parser.parse_args()'. No other unusual code or hardcoded secrets. No suspicious imports or operations.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an argument parser but contains a typo that would cause a runtime error, preventing execution. It only prints the current working directory, which is benign. No input data flows to sensitive sinks in a harmful way. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed. The 'Some bad stuff.' comment suggests possible malicious intent, but the actual code is simple and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, simple utility with no malicious behavior. The only issue is a typo that prevents execution, not an intentional malicious feature.",
