{
  "purpose": "A simple script intended to parse command-line arguments and print the current working directory.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse (though with a typo) and the current working directory via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs data; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input (arguments) intended to flow through argparse parsing to program logic; currently blocked by typo, so no execution flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in 'parsre.parse_args()' instead of 'parser.parse_args()'; comment 'Some bad stuff.' may be misleading; no malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and benign, designed to print the current directory. The only issue is a typo that prevents execution. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. No network activity, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities present. The comment 'Some bad stuff.' appears to be placeholder or misleading. The typo causes a runtime error but does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign with a minor syntactical bug. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are present. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are appropriate, reflecting a small bug but no security concern.",
