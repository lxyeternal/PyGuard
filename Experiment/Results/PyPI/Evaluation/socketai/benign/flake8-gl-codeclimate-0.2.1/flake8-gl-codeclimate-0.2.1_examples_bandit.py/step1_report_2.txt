{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use of eval and exec functions for executing arbitrary code, likely for testing or educational purposes.",
  "sources": "eval() calls with string inputs, especially those that evaluate code or manipulate files; exec() with string input.",
  "sinks": "eval() and exec() functions, which execute code that may contain malicious commands or unintended behavior.",
  "flows": "String inputs to eval() and exec() serve as sources; their execution leads to potential security impacts, including code execution or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on arbitrary strings, especially eval(\"os.getcwd()\"), which reveals current working directory; eval(\"os.chmod('%s', 0o777)\" % 'test.txt') changes file permissions; exec(\"do evil\") executes arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The code intentionally calls eval() with various strings, including a simple arithmetic expression, a system call to get current directory, and a potentially destructive chmod operation on a file named 'test.txt'. The exec() function executes a string 'do evil', which is a placeholder for malicious code. These functions are known to execute arbitrary code, and their use here suggests the code is designed to demonstrate or test unsafe code execution. The code presents multiple code execution vectors, which could be exploited maliciously. No obfuscation or hidden code patterns are present, but the use of eval and exec in this manner is inherently risky and often associated with malicious or unsafe code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates unsafe practices by executing arbitrary strings with eval() and exec(), which can be exploited for malicious purposes. It is intended for demonstration or testing and should be avoided in production environments due to high security risks.",
