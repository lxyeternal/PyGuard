  "purpose": "Demonstrate and analyze the security implications of using eval() and exec() with static strings, highlighting potential risks without active malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "eval() calls with string expressions, exec() call with string code",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of arbitrary code, system calls, file permission modifications",
  "flows": "eval() and exec() functions executing static strings; no dynamic or untrusted input flows present",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() and exec() with static strings; no obfuscation; demonstration code with placeholder 'do evil'",
  "analysis": "The code contains eval() calls executing simple expressions and system functions, along with an exec() executing a placeholder string. These functions are inherently risky, especially with untrusted input, but in this static example, they do not execute malicious payloads. The malware score should be very low (~0.1), as no actual malware exists; the code demonstrates risky patterns but is not malicious. The security risk score is high (~0.8), reflecting unsafe practices that could be exploited if inputs were untrusted. Obfuscation is absent, so score is 0. The overall risk is significant due to unsafe functions, but the static nature limits actual danger. Scores should be adjusted to reflect this: malware ~0.2–0.3, risk ~0.4–0.5, obfuscation 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates unsafe use of eval() and exec(), which pose security risks if misused. There is no active malware present; the current scores overstate the danger. A more accurate assessment assigns a very low malware score (~0.2–0.3), high risk (~0.8), and no obfuscation. The primary concern is unsafe coding practices, not active malicious payloads.",
