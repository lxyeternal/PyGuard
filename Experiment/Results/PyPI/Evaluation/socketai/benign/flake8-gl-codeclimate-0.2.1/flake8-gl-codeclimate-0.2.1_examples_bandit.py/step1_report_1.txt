  "purpose": "Demonstration of evaluating and executing dynamic code snippets, likely for security testing or educational purposes.",
  "sources": [
    "The eval() function calls with string inputs, especially those involving user-controlled or dynamic data.",
    "The exec() function call with a string argument."

  "sinks": [
    "The eval() with os.getcwd() and os.chmod(), which execute potentially sensitive operations.",

  "flows": [
    "eval() on \"1+1\" → simple expression evaluation, no security concern.",
    "eval() on \"os.getcwd()\" → calls os.getcwd(), exposing current working directory.",
    "eval() on string with os.chmod() → changes permissions of 'test.txt', potential security risk if filename is controlled.",
    "exec() on \"do evil\" → executes arbitrary code."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of eval() and exec() on string inputs, which can execute arbitrary code and pose security risks.",
    "Direct execution of potentially dangerous code snippets without validation.",
    "Potential for malicious code execution via eval() and exec(), especially if input is user-controlled."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates the use of eval() and exec() with string inputs, which are inherently risky. The eval() calls evaluate simple expressions and function calls like os.getcwd() and os.chmod(). The os.chmod() line modifies file permissions, which could be malicious if manipulated, though in this static example it's benign. The exec() call executes a hardcoded string 'do evil', which is a clear example of executing arbitrary code, indicative of malicious intent. Overall, the code showcases unsafe code execution practices with the potential for malicious behavior if inputs are uncontrolled.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially dangerous constructs such as eval() and exec(), which can execute arbitrary code. Although the current example is static and not malicious, the usage pattern is unsafe and could lead to security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior if exploited with untrusted input.",
