    "Source: eval(\"os.chmod('%s', 0o777)\" % 'test.txt') -> Sink: eval() executes os.chmod() with hardcoded filename",

    "Demonstration of executing arbitrary code via eval() and exec(), which are security risks"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code intentionally demonstrates insecure practices by using eval() and exec() with string inputs that could be manipulated or could execute arbitrary code. The eval() calls show how arbitrary expressions, including OS commands, can be evaluated unsafely. The exec() call directly executes a string labeled 'do evil,' illustrating a potential backdoor or malicious code execution. These practices are dangerous if used with untrusted input and are typically flagged as security issues. The code does not contain hidden malware but showcases how unsafe code can lead to malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code highlights insecure use of eval() and exec() functions, illustrating how malicious or unintended code execution can occur. It is a security risk pattern rather than malware itself. The example is for demonstration or testing purposes and should be avoided in production code.",
