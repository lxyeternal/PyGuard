  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates unsafe use of eval() and exec(), which pose security risks if misused. There is no active malware present; the current scores overstate the danger. A more accurate assessment assigns a very low malware score (~0.2–0.3), high risk (~0.8), and no obfuscation. The primary concern is unsafe coding practices, not active malicious payloads."
