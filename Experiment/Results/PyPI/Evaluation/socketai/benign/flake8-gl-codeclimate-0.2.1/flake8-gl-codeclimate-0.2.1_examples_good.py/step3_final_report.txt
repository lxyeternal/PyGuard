  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'Hello World' with no input, data flow, or external interactions.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from any source.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no inputs, external communications, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code does not perform any malicious or risky actions, and there are no signs of obfuscation or anomalies. The assessments are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current analysis and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
