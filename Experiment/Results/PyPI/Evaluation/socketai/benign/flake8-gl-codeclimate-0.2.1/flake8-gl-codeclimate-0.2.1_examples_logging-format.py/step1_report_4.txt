  "purpose": "The code logs an informational message using the logging module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a string literal in the format method of a string.",
  "sinks": "The logging.info function writes output to the logging system, which may be configured to write to console or file.",
  "flows": "The string formatting output is passed directly to logging.info, which logs the message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The use of logging is benign; no input from untrusted sources is processed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, then calls logging.info with a formatted string. The formatted string is static, containing no user input or untrusted data. The use of logging.info is typical for debug or informational purposes. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard logging with a static message. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It appears to be benign code with no security concerns.",
