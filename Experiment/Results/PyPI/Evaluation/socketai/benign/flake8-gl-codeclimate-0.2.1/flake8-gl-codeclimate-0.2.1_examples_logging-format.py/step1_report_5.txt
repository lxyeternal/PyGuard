  "flows": "Input data (format string) flows into the logging call and output is generated",
  "anomalies": "Usage of logging.info() without configuring the logging module; no apparent malicious code or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module and uses logging.info() with a formatted string. There are no user inputs, network operations, or data manipulations that could lead to data leaks or code injection. The code does not perform any actions that are suspicious or malicious, nor does it contain obfuscation or hidden behaviors. It simply logs a message. The format string does not contain any untrusted input, and there are no external data sources or sinks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic logging operation with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard logging usage example with no signs of malicious behavior.",
