  "purpose": "This code logs a static informational message using the logging module.",
  "sources": "The call to logging.info() with a formatted string containing a static message.",
  "sinks": "Logging output (console or file) where the message is recorded.",
  "flows": "Static string formatting in logging.info() without external input; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses static strings with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module and executes a logging.info() call with a static, formatted string. There are no untrusted inputs, no external data sources, and no network activity. The message 'Do not do this!' is hardcoded and benign. The code performs a standard logging operation with no malicious intent, data leakage, or vulnerabilities. The simplicity and static nature of the code indicate a low security risk. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. All signals point to a benign, well-understood logging statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, performs a benign logging operation, and contains no malicious or security issues. The static message and lack of external data or network activity confirm its benign nature. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
