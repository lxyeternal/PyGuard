{
  "purpose": "The code imports and prints the current working directory and the version of the 'flake8' package, likely for informational or diagnostic purposes.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() to read current working directory, flake8.__version__ to access package version information.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting data; no data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input sources (os.getcwd(), flake8.__version__) flow into print functions, which display the data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'flake8' and standard modules, then defines an abstract class 'X' with an unimplemented method. The main() function outputs current working directory and 'flake8' version. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious activities. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving an informational purpose without any malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
