  "anomalies": "Unused abstract class 'X' with unimplemented method 'x()' that is never invoked.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a third-party package, defines an unused abstract class, and prints environment info. No untrusted input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The abstract class is redundant and does not impact security. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The unused abstract class is harmless but unnecessary. The overall assessment confirms no malicious or security concerns.",
