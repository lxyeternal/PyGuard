{
  "purpose": "The script is a simple utility that prints the current working directory and the version of the 'flake8' package.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() to get current working directory; flake8.__version__ to retrieve package version",
  "sinks": "print statements that output current working directory and package version",
  "flows": "Input from environment (current directory) and package attribute flows to output via print",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; the code is straightforward and typical for utility scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a static package 'flake8' and standard modules 'os' and 'abc'. It defines an abstract class 'X' with an abstract method 'x', but does not instantiate or use it. The 'main' function prints the current working directory and the version of 'flake8'. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data flows that could leak sensitive info, and no suspicious or malicious operations. The code appears benign, serving as a basic info utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility script that outputs the current directory and the 'flake8' package version. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
