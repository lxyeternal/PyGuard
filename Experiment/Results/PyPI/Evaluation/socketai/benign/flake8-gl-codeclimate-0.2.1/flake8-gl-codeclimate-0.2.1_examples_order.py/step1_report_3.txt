{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules, defines an abstract class, and prints the current working directory and the version of the flake8 package.",
  "sources": "Reading the current working directory via os.getcwd(), importing flake8 and os modules, accessing flake8.__version__",
  "sinks": "Printing output to console (not a sink for malicious data), no other direct data sinks present",
  "flows": "Input: os.getcwd() —> output via print; Flake8 version access —> output via print",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines an abstract class with an unimplemented method, and prints runtime environment information. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The usage of flake8 is read-only, just retrieving its version. The code appears to be a simple utility or test script with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign actions: imports modules, defines an abstract class, and prints environment info. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
