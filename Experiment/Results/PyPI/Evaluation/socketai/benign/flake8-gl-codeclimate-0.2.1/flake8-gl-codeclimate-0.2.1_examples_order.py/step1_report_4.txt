{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and defines an abstract class, then prints the current working directory and the version of the flake8 package.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd() for current directory, flake8.__version__ for package version",
  "targets": "None, no data output or external connection targeting untrusted data",
  "flows": "Input from os.getcwd() and flake8.__version__ are printed directly; no untrusted data flow to dangerous sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; abstract class with unimplemented method is standard for interface definition",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules, defines an abstract class without implementation, then outputs current directory and package version. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script that reports environment information and package version, with no malicious or security-risk behavior identified.",
