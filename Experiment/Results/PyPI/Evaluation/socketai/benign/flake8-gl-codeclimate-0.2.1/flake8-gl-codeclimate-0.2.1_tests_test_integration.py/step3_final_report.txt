{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a test suite to run static analysis tools (flake8 and plugins) on predefined Python example files, capture their output, and verify correctness via assertions.",
  "sources": "The code reads static example files ('examples/good.py', 'examples/bad.py', etc.) and external command outputs via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to temporary files and reads JSON data; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Sources are static files and command outputs; sinks are JSON files and assertions; flow is straightforward, with no untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is a standard testing harness with controlled inputs and outputs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled testing framework invoking static analysis tools on static files, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling. It performs subprocess calls, file I/O, and JSON parsing in a safe, predictable manner. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. External tools are invoked with static arguments, and the code's purpose is solely to verify static analysis results. The absence of network activity, secrets, or dynamic execution confirms its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign testing harness for static analysis tools with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
