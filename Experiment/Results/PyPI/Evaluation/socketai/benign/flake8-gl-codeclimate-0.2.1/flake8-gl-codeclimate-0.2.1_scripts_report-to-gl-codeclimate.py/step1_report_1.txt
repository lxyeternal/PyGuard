  "purpose": "Convert an existing flake8 report to a Gitlab Code Climate artifact by parsing report lines and formatting them accordingly.",
  "sources": "Input lines read from a file or stdin, potentially containing code quality issues.",
  "sinks": "Processing functions that parse lines and generate Violation objects, output handling via the formatter.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> Parsing with regex (flake8 or pylint format) -> Violation objects -> Formatter handling",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected; standard regex parsing and logging used.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input lines from a file or stdin, removes ANSI escape codes, and attempts to parse lines using predefined regex patterns for flake8 and pylint formats. Valid lines are converted into Violation objects, which are then handled by a formatter. The code includes standard logging and command-line argument parsing. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data exfiltration routines. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard report parsing and formatting for code quality tools. No malware indicators or malicious behavior are present. The code appears safe, with no signs of supply chain attacks or security risks.",
