  "purpose": "Convert flake8 and pylint reports into a GitLab Code Climate artifact by parsing report lines and creating violation objects for formatting.",
  "sources": "Input lines from stdin or a file, which contain report entries in known formats.",
  "sinks": "Violation objects passed to the formatter; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input lines -> regex parsing (flake8 or pylint format) -> violation object creation -> formatter handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; regex patterns are straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input lines, strips ANSI codes, matches lines against known report formats via regex, creates violation objects, and passes them to a formatter. It does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. The regex patterns are standard and used solely for parsing known report formats. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present. The script's purpose is benign, and its operations are straightforward. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward report parser with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.",
