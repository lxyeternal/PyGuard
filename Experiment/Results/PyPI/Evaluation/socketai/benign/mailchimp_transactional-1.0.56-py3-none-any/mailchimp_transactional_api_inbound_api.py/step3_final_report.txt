  "purpose": "Generated API client for managing inbound domains and routes via Mailchimp Transactional API.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, request bodies, and API key injection into request payloads.",
  "sinks": "call_api method transmitting data to external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method arguments into request bodies, with API key added before transmission, then sent via call_api.",
  "anomalies": "API key embedded directly into request bodies; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, generated SDK for API interactions. It injects the API key into request payloads, which is common but insecure if network security is compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The pattern of API key handling is a known security concern but not malicious. No external malicious signals or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, generated SDK code with no malicious intent. The main security issue is the insecure handling of API credentials by embedding them in request bodies, which is a common pattern but should be secured in deployment. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3 due to credential handling practices.",
