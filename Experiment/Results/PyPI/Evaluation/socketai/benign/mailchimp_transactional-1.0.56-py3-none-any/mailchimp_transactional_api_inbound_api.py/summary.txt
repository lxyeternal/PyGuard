  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, generated SDK code with no malicious intent. The main security issue is the insecure handling of API credentials by embedding them in request bodies, which is a common pattern but should be secured in deployment. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3 due to credential handling practices."
