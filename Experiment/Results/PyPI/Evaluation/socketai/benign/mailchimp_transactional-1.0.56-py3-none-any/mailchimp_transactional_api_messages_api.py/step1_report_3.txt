  "sources": "API key provided during initialization; API request bodies including message data and parameters.",
  "sinks": "API call methods sending HTTP POST requests with bodies that include API key and message data.",
  "flows": "Input API key and message parameters flow into request bodies; bodies are sent via call_api method to specific endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. All API interactions follow standard patterns. The code appends the API key to request bodies explicitly. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated API client for Mailchimp Transactional API, designed to send and manage email messages. It uses standard practices such as including the API key within request bodies and calling external endpoints via a dedicated API client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The API key is provided at initialization, which is typical for API clients. The code structure is straightforward, with clear source-to-sink data flows, and it only performs expected API interactions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, auto-generated API client for Mailchimp's transactional email service. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The design adheres to standard API client practices, with no signs of malicious sabotage or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
