  "purpose": "Import statements for various Mailchimp Transactional API modules to enable API functionality within a package.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing specific API classes from the 'mailchimp_transactional.api' package. There are no dynamic executions, no input handling, no network connections, nor any other potentially malicious actions. The structure and format are standard for Python package setup. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. This appears to be boilerplate code for setting up API access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements for API modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
