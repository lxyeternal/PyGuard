  "purpose": "Auto-generated Python SDK for Mailchimp Transactional API templates, enabling management of templates via standard API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from class attribute; user-supplied 'body' parameter; data flows into 'call_api' method.",
  "sinks": "Injects API key into request payloads; data sent via HTTP POST requests to specific endpoints.",
  "flows": "Source (API key in class) → injection into 'body' parameter → 'call_api' method → API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; standard pattern of API key injection; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated SDK that manages API interactions for email templates. It injects the API key into request bodies, which is typical for such SDKs. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The pattern of embedding API keys in request payloads is standard but should be managed securely outside the code. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are detected. The security risk is minimal and consistent with normal SDK operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated API client with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The main security consideration is external management of API keys, not the code itself. Scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2 due to API key handling pattern. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use.",
