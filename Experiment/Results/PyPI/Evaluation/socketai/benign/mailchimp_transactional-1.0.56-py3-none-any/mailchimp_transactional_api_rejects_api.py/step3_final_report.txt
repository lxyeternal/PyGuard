  "purpose": "Auto-generated API client for managing email reject list via Mailchimp Transactional API.",
  "sources": "Request parameters, class attribute self.api_key inserted into request body, external call_api method.",
  "sinks": "External API endpoint calls with request payloads containing API key.",
  "flows": "API key from class attribute inserted into request body, then sent via call_api to API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Insertion of API key into request body is standard for API clients; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated wrapper for Mailchimp rejectlist management. It performs parameter validation, inserts the API key into request payloads, and calls external API endpoints. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The API key handling is typical but should be protected outside this code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves its purpose as an API client. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor security concern regarding API key handling is standard for such clients and does not indicate malicious activity.",
