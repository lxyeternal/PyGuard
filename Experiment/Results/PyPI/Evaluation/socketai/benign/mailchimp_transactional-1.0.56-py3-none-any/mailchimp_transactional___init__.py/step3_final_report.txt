  "purpose": "A client SDK wrapper for Mailchimp Transactional API, managing API keys and API modules for various endpoints.",
  "sources": "API key input via constructor and setter methods, and data passed to API modules during initialization.",
  "sinks": "API key stored in class attribute and passed to API modules; no external data sources or untrusted inputs directly influence the code.",
  "flows": "API key input → stored in class attribute → passed to API modules during instantiation; no other data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK wrapper that initializes API modules with a provided API key and manages configuration settings like output format and timeout. It does not contain any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The API key is handled securely in memory and passed to modules, with no external data leaks or suspicious behaviors. The reinitialization of modules upon API key change is typical for SDKs. No anomalies or malicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK wrapper for Mailchimp's API, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with its functionality, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk related to API key handling.",
