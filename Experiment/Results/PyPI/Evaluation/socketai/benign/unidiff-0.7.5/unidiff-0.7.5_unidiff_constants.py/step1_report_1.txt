  "purpose": "Define regex patterns and constants for parsing and analyzing diff files and related data in a version control context.",
  "sources": "Reading pattern definitions, regex compilation, and constant initializations at module load time.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code mainly compiles regexes and sets constants without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up static patterns and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code is straightforward pattern definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of regex pattern compilation and constant definitions intended for diff parsing. There is no user input handling, no network activity, and no execution of untrusted data. The license and comments are standard, and no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining regex patterns and constants for diff file analysis. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
