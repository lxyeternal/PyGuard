  "purpose": "Defines regex patterns and constants for parsing diff files, including filenames, headers, hunks, and binary diffs.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern definitions and constants, no input reading or data processing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static pattern definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static regex compilation without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, pattern-based, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of regex pattern definitions and constants used for parsing diff files. It imports the 're' module and compiles multiple regexes for filenames, headers, hunks, binary diffs, and line types. There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external data processing. The patterns are standard and correctly formulated. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The code is static and benign, serving as a utility module for diff parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static utility module defining regex patterns for diff parsing. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
