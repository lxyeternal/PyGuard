  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining regex patterns and constants for parsing diff files.\n- They consistently state that the code is static, contains no input handling, no execution of untrusted data, and no malicious behavior.\n- The code appears to be a benign utility module for diff parsing.\n\n**Confirmations & Validity:**\n- The code only compiles regex patterns and defines constants; there are no dynamic operations, no data processing, no network calls, and no code execution.\n- The regex patterns are standard for diff parsing, matching filenames, headers, hunks, and binary diffs.\n- No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- The logic and reasoning are sound; the code is straightforward and safe.\n- No need for changes in scores or conclusions.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity or code behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — The code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risk is evident; the code is purely definitional.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Since the code is only regex pattern definitions, the risk of hidden malicious behavior is negligible.\n- The pattern compilation is static and does not process untrusted data at runtime.\n- The license and comments are standard and do not raise concerns.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for diff parsing.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at 0.0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's safety and benign intent.",
