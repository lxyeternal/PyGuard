  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for parsing errors related to unified diff data.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class declaration is static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple exception definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with license info and a class declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python exception class with license headers and a descriptive docstring. It imports unicode_literals for compatibility and defines a single exception class. There are no input/output operations, data processing, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, unobfuscated, and typical for open-source projects. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden payloads, or security risks are present. The simplicity and transparency of the code, along with the consistent reports, support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0. The reports and analysis confirm its safety and appropriateness for use.",
