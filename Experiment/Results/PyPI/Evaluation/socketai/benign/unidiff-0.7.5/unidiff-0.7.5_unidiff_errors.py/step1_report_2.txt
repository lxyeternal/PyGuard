  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines an exception class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definition with no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module that defines a custom exception class. It includes license information, a docstring, and a class declaration inheriting from Exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities. The license and code structure appear legitimate and typical for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, straightforward definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
