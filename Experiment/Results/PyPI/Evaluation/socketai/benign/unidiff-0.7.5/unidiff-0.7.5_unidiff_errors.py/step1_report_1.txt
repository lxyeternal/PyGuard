  "purpose": "Define custom exception for parsing unified diff data in a package.",
  "sources": "No input sources; no data reading beyond standard exception class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definition with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class for handling parse errors related to diff data. It imports __future__.unicode_literals for compatibility, but otherwise contains only a class declaration with a docstring. There are no input/output operations, no handling of external data, no use of external or suspicious libraries, and no code that could be malicious or maliciously modified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign code snippet defining a standard custom exception class. It shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
