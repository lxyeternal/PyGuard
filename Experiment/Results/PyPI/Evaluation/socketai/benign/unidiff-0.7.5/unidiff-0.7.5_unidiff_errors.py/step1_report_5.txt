  "purpose": "Define custom exception for parsing diff data in the package",
  "sources": "No external data input; code defines an exception class",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward class definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports future unicode_literals for compatibility and defines a single exception class, UnidiffParseError, with no additional logic or data handling. It contains no embedded or hidden malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. It appears to be a standard, minimal exception class used for error handling within a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition with no malicious or security-related issues. It is unlikely to pose any security risks or contain malicious behavior.",
