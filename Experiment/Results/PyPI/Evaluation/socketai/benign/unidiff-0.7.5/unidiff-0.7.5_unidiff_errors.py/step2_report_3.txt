  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a single custom exception class `UnidiffParseError`.\n   - It imports `__future__.unicode_literals` for compatibility.\n   - It includes licensing information and a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks**:\n   - The code is a minimal, standard class definition for an exception.\n   - No data is read, written, or transmitted.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.\n   - The license and structure are typical for open-source projects.\n\n3. **Review of Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 in all reports is correct; no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk score**: 0 is justified; the code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume that the code snippet is isolated and that no malicious modifications exist elsewhere.\n   - Since the code is only a class definition, it cannot be malicious on its own.\n   - No signs of hidden payloads or obfuscation are present.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code is benign, with no security risks or malware.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, harmless exception class definition with no security concerns.",
