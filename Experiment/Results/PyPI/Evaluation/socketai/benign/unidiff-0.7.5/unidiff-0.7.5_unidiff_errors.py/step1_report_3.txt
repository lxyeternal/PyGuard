  "purpose": "Define custom exception class for handling diff parsing errors",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only code execution within the package",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; standard exception class definition",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module defining a custom exception class for parsing errors. It imports a future feature for Unicode compatibility and provides licensing information. There are no external inputs, data processing, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no network or system calls present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard exception class definition with no malicious or security concerns.",
