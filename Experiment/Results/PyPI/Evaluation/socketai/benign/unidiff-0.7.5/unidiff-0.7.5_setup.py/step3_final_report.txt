  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and configuration for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst for long description; executes __version__.py to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and executes version file to gather metadata before calling setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if the version file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious activity. The only minor concern is the use of exec() to load version data, which is standard but could pose security risks if the source files are tampered with. No network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the context and code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and follows common practices for Python package setup. The only slight security concern is the use of exec(), which is acceptable in trusted environments. No evidence of malicious intent or activity is detected.",
