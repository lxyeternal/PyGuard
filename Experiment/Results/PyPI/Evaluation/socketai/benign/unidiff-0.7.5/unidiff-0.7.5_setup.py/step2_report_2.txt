  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python library.\n- The main concern raised across multiple reports is the use of `exec()` to load version info from `__version__.py`.\n- No reports identify actual malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The scores assigned are very low, with malware and security risk scores generally at 0 or near 0.\n- Confidence levels are high, indicating that the reviewers believe the script is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code behavior:** The code reads static files (`README.rst`, `__version__.py`) and executes the version file to obtain the version number. It then calls `setup()` with this info.\n- **Potential issues:** The only concern is the use of `exec()` which could be risky if the version file is tampered with. However, this is a common pattern in setup scripts, and no actual malicious activity is present.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The reasoning that `exec()` could be risky if the version file is compromised is valid but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, generally around 0.1, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- Since no malicious code or activity is present, higher scores are unwarranted.\n- The only point of concern is the use of `exec()`, but this is a standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to `exec()` usage, but this is common and not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nConsidering all factors, I agree with the assessments provided. The script is a typical setup.py with no malicious intent.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Summary:** The script is safe, with only a minor concern about the use of `exec()`, which is standard in many setup scripts but should be used cautiously if the version file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The only minor concern is the `exec()` pattern, which is common but could be risky if the source files are tampered with. Overall, the code is safe.",
