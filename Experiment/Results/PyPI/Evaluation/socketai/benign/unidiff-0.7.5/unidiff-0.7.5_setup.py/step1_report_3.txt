  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'unidiff' Python library, defining metadata and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading README file for long description, executing '__version__.py' for version info, and loading package data.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the script does not process external input at runtime beyond static file reading.",
  "flows": "Read README -> execute '__version__.py' -> setup configuration process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to load version information can be risky if the file contents are malicious or tampered with, but typical in setup scripts. No other suspicious activity or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading documentation, loading version info via exec, and configuring setup parameters. The use of 'exec' is a potential security concern if the '__version__.py' file is compromised, but this is a common practice in setup files. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The rest of the code is straightforward package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, primarily performing standard package installation configuration. The use of 'exec' to load version info warrants minimal caution but is typical for setup scripts. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
