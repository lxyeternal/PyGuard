  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'unidiff' Python library, including metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README file for long description, reading '__version__.py' for version info, and defining package data for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input data, network operations, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow from source to sink; the script only reads static files and configures package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard setup procedures. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines package metadata. It reads static files for description and version info. It then calls setup() with these parameters. There are no indications of malicious intent, code injection, or obfuscation. It uses exec() to load version info, which is common in setup scripts, but this is a standard pattern, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script for package distribution. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. It performs standard setup procedures without suspicious elements.",
