  "purpose": "Setup script for the unidiff Python package, used to define package metadata and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file ('README.rst') and executing the contents of 'unidiff/__version__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation beyond reading local files.",
  "flows": "Reading files ('README.rst' and '__version__.py') and executing code from '__version__.py' in a controlled scope.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run the contents of '__version__.py' could be risky if the file contains malicious code, but this is a common pattern for setting version info in setup scripts. No other suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses them to read static files for package metadata. The use of 'exec' on a local version file is a known pattern, though it can be risky if the file is tampered with, but in typical usage, this file is controlled and unlikely to be malicious. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard, with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec', which is common but could be risky if the version file is compromised. Overall, the script is safe and typical for package setup.",
