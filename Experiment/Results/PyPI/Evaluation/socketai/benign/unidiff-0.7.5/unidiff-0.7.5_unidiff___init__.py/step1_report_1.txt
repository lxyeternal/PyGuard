  "purpose": "To provide a library for parsing Unified Diff files, likely used for diff analysis or patch management.",
  "sources": "Import of __version__ from unidiff and specific classes/constants from unidiff.patch.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; code mainly imports modules and defines a version variable.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no processing of external input or untrusted data occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward library setup, importing specific modules and defining a version variable. No input handling, no execution of dynamic or external code, no network activity, nor suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup for a parsing library with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified.",
