{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup module for the 'unidiff' parsing library, importing components and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'unidiff' package, reading __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow involving external input",
  "flows": "None; static import and variable assignment only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard license headers and straightforward imports",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializing a library with license comments, importing specific classes and constants from 'unidiff', and setting a version variable. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The code's purpose is purely to set up the library environment. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's structure and content are typical for an open-source library module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard library setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
