  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and informational.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code structures are present. The code is standard licensing boilerplate with no embedded malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, copyright notices, and a version string. There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or executable logic that could be exploited. The absence of dynamic code execution, hidden code, or obfuscated segments indicates no malicious intent. The license and metadata are standard and do not introduce security concerns.",
