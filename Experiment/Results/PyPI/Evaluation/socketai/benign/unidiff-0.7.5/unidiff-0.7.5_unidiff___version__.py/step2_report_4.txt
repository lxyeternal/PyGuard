  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Assessment**: The report correctly identifies that the code is only license comments and a version variable assignment. No executable code, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n   - **Malware & Obfuscated Scores**: Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0, justified given the benign nature.\n   - **Conclusion**: The report is accurate; no issues detected.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Assessment**: Similar to Report 1, it correctly states the code is just license and version info, with no dynamic or executable parts.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated are 0, which aligns with the code's static, benign nature.\n   - **Risk**: 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate, no concerns.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Assessment**: Again, the code is purely metadata, with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk**: 0, correctly assigned.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid assessment.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Assessment**: Correctly notes the code is a standard header with no executable logic.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated are 0, matching the code's static nature.\n   - **Risk**: 0, justified.\n   - **Conclusion**: Properly rated.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Assessment**: Also consistent with previous reports; only license comments and version string.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated are 0, appropriate.\n   - **Risk**: 0, justified.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate.\n\n**Overall Summary**:\n- The code snippets are all standard license headers and version declarations, with no executable code, no data processing, and no suspicious patterns.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0 across the board, which is consistent and appropriate.\n\n**My Final Estimation**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk in static license and version info)\n\n**Final Note**: The reports are thorough and accurate; no adjustments needed. The code is entirely benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
