  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a header with license comments and a version string.\n   - There are no executable statements, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code that could be malicious.\n   - No obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for a Python module, with no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is just license comments and a version variable, there is no basis for increasing the risk score.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, comments, and a variable assignment.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard header with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.",
