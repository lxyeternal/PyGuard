  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version declaration for the software, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' assignment and license comments",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code contains only static comments and a variable assignment",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static with no dynamic or external data interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a version variable, with no executable functions, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all zero, consistent with the static, harmless nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless license header with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
