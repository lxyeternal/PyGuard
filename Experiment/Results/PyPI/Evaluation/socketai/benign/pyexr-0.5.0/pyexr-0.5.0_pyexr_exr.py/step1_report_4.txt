  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes for reading, writing, and processing OpenEXR image files, including handling multiple channels and data types, as well as managing EXR file headers and channel mappings.",
  "sources": "Input is read from EXR files via open() and InputFile.get() / get_all() / get_dict() methods, which access file headers and channel data buffers. Data is processed from file buffers into numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "Data is converted into numpy arrays and then written back to files in write(), with channel data serialized to bytes. No untrusted data is directly used in system commands or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input file headers and channel buffers are read as sources, transformed into numpy arrays in get() / get_all(), possibly modified, and then written to disk via write(). No external network or system command calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive handling of image data with specific focus on channels, precision, and compression settings. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The compression level header label function restricts compression options. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution patterns observed. No external network or system operations are present. The code assumes trusted inputs like filenames and channel names, but these are typical for image processing libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages EXR image data, providing functions for opening files, reading channels, writing images, and handling compression and channel metadata. It carefully manages data types, channel names, and image dimensions. No code execution, network access, or file manipulation beyond reading and writing image data is observed. All data flows are within the context of file I/O and numpy array manipulations, which are standard and safe. The functions for compression levels and channel management appear to be routine. No hardcoded secrets, malicious backdoors, or suspicious code paths are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured image processing library for EXR files. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident. It handles data securely and performs expected image I/O operations without external system or network interactions. The likelihood of malicious intent or sabotage is very low.",
