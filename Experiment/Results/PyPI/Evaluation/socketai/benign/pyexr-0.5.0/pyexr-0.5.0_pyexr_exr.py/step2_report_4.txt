  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility for managing EXR files, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, network activity, or malicious code. The analysis is thorough.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code appears legitimate, with standard image processing functions. The low security risk score aligns with the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard image handling with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent. The code is a typical image processing utility with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Handles EXR images, supports compression, channel management, and tonemapping.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate. The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is acceptable, given the potential for misconfiguration or misuse in a supply chain context, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for reading/writing EXR files, with proper handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The low risk score matches the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard EXR file management, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code is a legitimate image processing utility.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the straightforward, well-structured code.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, mainly due to potential misconfiguration or misuse rather than inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the evaluations are appropriately cautious and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation.\n\n**Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to the potential for misuse in supply chain scenarios, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, standard for its purpose, and free of malicious intent.",
