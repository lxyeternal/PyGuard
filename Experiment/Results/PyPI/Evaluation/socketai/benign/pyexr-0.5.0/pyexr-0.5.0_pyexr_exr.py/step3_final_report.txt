{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for reading, writing, and processing OpenEXR image files, including handling channels, compression, and tonemapping.",
  "sources": "Filename input, channel selection parameters, user-defined headers, numpy arrays, and file buffers.",
  "sinks": "Writes pixel data to EXR files via OpenEXR's OutputFile, and reads pixel data into numpy arrays.",
  "flows": "File validation -> opening with open() -> reading or writing pixel data -> processing (e.g., tonemap) -> file output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, network activity, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image file I/O and processing using trusted libraries. It validates files, manages channels and headers properly, and handles data conversions securely. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external communications are present. The functions are well-structured and typical for image processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source image processing utility for EXR files with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
