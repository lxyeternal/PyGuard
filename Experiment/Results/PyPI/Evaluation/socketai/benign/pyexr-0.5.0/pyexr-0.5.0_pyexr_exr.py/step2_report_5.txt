  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the details within each.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code handles reading/writing EXR files, with data coming from filename parameters and user-specified channels/precisions.\n- **Sinks:** Writing pixel data via OpenEXR's OutputFile.\n- **Flows:** Input file -> parsing -> numpy arrays/dicts -> output files.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report concludes the code is a legitimate utility with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured image processing utility.  \n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.  \n- The malware score is appropriately 0.  \n- Security risk is low (~0.1).  \n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, focusing on reading/writing EXR images.\n- **Sinks:** File output, data conversion.\n- **Flows:** File system to numpy arrays, no external network.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard image handling code, safe, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is typical for image I/O, with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- Malware score remains 0.  \n- Security risk is minimal (~0).\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Handles EXR images, with support for compression, channels, and tonemapping.\n- **Sinks:** Writes images with optional headers and compression.\n- **Flows:** Data input -> processing (including tonemap) -> file output.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine image processing functions, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code performs typical image processing tasks securely.  \n- Malware score is 0.  \n- Security risk is very low (~0.2).\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads/writes EXR images, managing headers, channels, and compression.\n- **Sinks:** File output, buffer processing.\n- **Flows:** File headers/channels read -> numpy arrays -> write back.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard image handling, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is consistent with legitimate image processing.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Security risk: low (~0.1).\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions for reading/writing EXR files.\n- **Sinks:** Files via OpenEXR.\n- **Flows:** File validation -> reading buffers -> numpy arrays -> writing files.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard image processing code, safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Security risk: low (~0.2).\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the nature of the code as a legitimate image processing utility.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (very low, standard for image processing libraries)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility for handling EXR image files, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as they are.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that external dependencies (OpenEXR, Imath, numpy) are from trusted sources and kept up to date to mitigate supply chain risks.",
