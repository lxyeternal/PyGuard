  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code defines a version string (`__version__`) and an `__all__` list to specify what symbols are exported.\n   - It imports multiple constants, classes, and functions from the `pyexr.exr` module.\n   - The comments indicate the use of `poetry-dynamic-versioning`, a common version management tool.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no data processing, and no network operations.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies:**\n   - No suspicious constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code is straightforward, serving as a module interface or wrapper around the `pyexr.exr` library.\n   - The imports are from a trusted external library related to EXR image processing, with no signs of malicious payloads.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Data Flows:**\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources.\n   - No data is processed, outputted, or transmitted within this snippet.\n   - The code does not handle user input or external data directly.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. There is no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n5. **Any Inconsistencies or Overestimations?**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified.\n   - No overestimation or underestimation is apparent.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured module setup that re-exports symbols from a trusted external library.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores across all reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The existing assessments are accurate and reasonable.",
