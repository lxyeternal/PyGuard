  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a version string (__version__).\n- Defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols.\n- Imports multiple constants, classes, and functions from `pyexr.exr`.\n- Contains a benign comment about `poetry-dynamic-versioning`.\n- No data processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All conclude that the code is standard, straightforward, and exhibits no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- They note the absence of obfuscation, data leaks, or code injection.\n- The comments and structure are typical for Python modules that re-export symbols from an external library.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of the code and reports:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code itself does not process data, execute untrusted code, or contain any malicious payloads. It is purely a module setup, exposing symbols from `pyexr.exr`.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  - **malware score:** 0, since there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n  - **obfuscated score:** 0, the code is clear and straightforward.\n  - **security risk score:** 0, no vulnerabilities or risky operations are present.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they only analyze static code structure.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0. The code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, safe module setup that re-exports symbols from an external library.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk metrics.",
