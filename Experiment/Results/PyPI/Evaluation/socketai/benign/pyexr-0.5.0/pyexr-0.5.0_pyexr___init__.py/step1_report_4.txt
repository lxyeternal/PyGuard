{
  "purpose": "Define module version and re-export specific functions and constants from the pyexr.exr package",
  "sources": "Module attributes (__version__, __all__) and import statement from pyexr.exr",
  "sites": "Imports from pyexr.exr, which could be external dependencies or internal modules",
  "flows": "Imported functions/constants could be used later in the code, but no data flows are evident here",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected; only standard version and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and an __all__ list for module exports, then imports specific functions and constants from the pyexr.exr package. There is no user input, no untrusted data handling, no code execution, or network activity. The comments indicate version management with poetry-dynamic-versioning, which is a typical package versioning tool. All operations are static and standard for Python packages, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module setup with imports and versioning, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It primarily serves to expose functions/constants from the pyexr.exr module.",
