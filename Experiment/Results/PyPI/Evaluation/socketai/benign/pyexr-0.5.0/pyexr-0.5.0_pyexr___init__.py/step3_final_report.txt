{
  "purpose": "Module setup for exposing symbols from the pyexr.exr library with versioning info.",
  "sources": "Static definitions (__version__, __all__) and import statements from pyexr.exr.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Import statements bring in symbols from pyexr.exr; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, benign comment about versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and an export list, then imports multiple constants and functions from a trusted external library. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, or network activity. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The structure is typical for a module acting as an interface or wrapper. Given the static nature and the absence of malicious patterns, the code poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious elements. It simply re-exports symbols from a trusted library and manages version info. The malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
