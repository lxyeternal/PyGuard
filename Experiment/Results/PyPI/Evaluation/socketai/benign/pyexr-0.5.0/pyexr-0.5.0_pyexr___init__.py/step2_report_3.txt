  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a `__version__` string and an `__all__` list, which are standard for Python modules to specify version info and public API.\n   - It imports multiple constants, classes, and functions from `pyexr.exr`, a third-party library related to EXR image processing.\n   - The comments mention \"poetry-dynamic-versioning,\" which is a common tool for managing package versions, and are benign.\n\n2. **Security Implications:**\n   - The code itself does not process data, handle user input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n   - The imported symbols are from a trusted external library (`pyexr.exr`) that handles image processing, not known for malicious behavior.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Potential Risks:**\n   - Since the code only sets up module exports and imports symbols, the risk of malicious activity or vulnerabilities is minimal.\n   - The actual security of the package depends on `pyexr.exr`, but within this snippet, there's no indication of issues.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks are evident in this setup code.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - All reports consistently identify the code as standard, with no anomalies or suspicious activity.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard module setup, defining version info, public API, and importing symbols from a trusted library.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code appears safe, with no security concerns.",
