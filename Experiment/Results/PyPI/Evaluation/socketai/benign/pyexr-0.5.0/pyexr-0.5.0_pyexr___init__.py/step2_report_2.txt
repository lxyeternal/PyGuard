  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- Defines a version string (__version__).\n- Defines an __all__ list for exports.\n- Imports a set of constants, classes, and functions from the external 'pyexr.exr' module.\n- Contains a benign comment about poetry-dynamic-versioning.\n- No data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward module setup, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Scores given (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature. The securityRisk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports suggest any risk higher than 0.5, and given the code's simplicity, this is justified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Since no malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior is present, malware scores should remain at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's static analysis, which is correct.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report's analysis:**  \n  All reports are consistent with the code and assign appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Assessment:\n\n- The code is a typical module that re-exports symbols from an external library, with a version string and an export list.  \n- No dynamic code, no data handling, no network activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.  \n- The comments and structure are standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.  \n**Risk score:** **0** — No security risk identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. They correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as a module interface to an external library, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
