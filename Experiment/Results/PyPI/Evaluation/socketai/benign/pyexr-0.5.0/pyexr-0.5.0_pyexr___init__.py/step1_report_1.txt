{
  "purpose": "Define and expose specific constants, classes, and functions related to EXR image processing, delegating implementations to the pyexr.exr module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module-level variables __version__ and __all__, and imports symbols from pyexr.exr.",
  "sinks": "Imported symbols from pyexr.exr could potentially execute or process untrusted data if they contain vulnerabilities, but this code itself does not process data directly.",
  "flows": "The code does not include data processing flows; it only imports functions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The comment about poetry-dynamic-versioning is benign and common in version control practices.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes module metadata (__version__, __all__) and imports multiple symbols from an external library (pyexr.exr). There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity. The comment about versioning is informational and not suspicious. The import statement is straightforward and typical for Python modules. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup that defines exports and imports symbols from a trusted external library. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
