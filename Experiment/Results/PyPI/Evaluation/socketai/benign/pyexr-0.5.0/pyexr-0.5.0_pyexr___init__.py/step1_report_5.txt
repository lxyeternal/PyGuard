{
  "purpose": "Define and expose specific functions, classes, and constants from the pyexr.exr module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module __version__, and imports symbols from pyexr.exr.",
  "sinks": "Imported symbols could potentially be used elsewhere, but no direct sink for untrusted data or execution found.",
  "flows": "__version__ is a string assigned directly; imported symbols are used for exposing functionalities, no data flow from untrusted sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, defines an explicit __all__ list for exports, and imports various classes and functions from the pyexr.exr module. All operations are standard for module setup and export. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. The import statements simply bring in external functions and constants, with no indication of malicious activity. No potentially dangerous operations or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initialization script for a Python package, exposing specific functions and constants. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and standard.",
