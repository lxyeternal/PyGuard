{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module-level metadata, exports, and imports functions and constants from the pyexr.exr library related to EXR image processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data directly; it imports symbols from a third-party library (pyexr.exr).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output or untrusted data handling within this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code only defines exports and imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a list of public exports, then imports a set of functions and constants from a third-party library, pyexr.exr. There is no user input handling, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any data processing that could lead to security issues. The comments indicate a versioning note, and all imports are from a well-known library related to EXR image handling. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package that interfaces with the pyexr.exr library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data flows, or security risks within this code fragment.",
