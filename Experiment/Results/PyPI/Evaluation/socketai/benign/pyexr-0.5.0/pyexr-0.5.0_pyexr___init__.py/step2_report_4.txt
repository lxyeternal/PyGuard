  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module setup, defining version info, an export list, and importing symbols from a third-party library (`pyexr.exr`).\n- No data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The comments about versioning are benign and common in package development.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The reports are very consistent and cautious, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- Since the code is purely import/export and versioning, the risk scores are justified as zero.\n- The only possible concern could be if the imported `pyexr.exr` library contains malicious code, but this is outside the scope of this specific snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The provided reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's static and benign nature.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard module setup with no security concerns.",
