  "purpose": "This code defines and exports certain constants, error classes, and functions related to the 'pyexr' package, likely for handling EXR image files.",
  "sources": "The code imports data from 'pyexr.exr', which is a third-party library/module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed, transmitted, or stored insecurely within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the imported 'pyexr.exr' module into the local namespace via import statements, with no processing or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The comment about version management is standard and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily assigns a version string, defines an exported list, and imports various classes and functions from a third-party 'pyexr.exr' module. There is no evidence of malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical module setup, delegating actual functionality to the 'pyexr' library. No data manipulation, network activity, or other risky operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports items from an external library and defines a version. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code snippet.",
