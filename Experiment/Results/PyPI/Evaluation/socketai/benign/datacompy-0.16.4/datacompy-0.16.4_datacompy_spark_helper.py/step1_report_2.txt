{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for comparing Spark DataFrames by row order, including casting string columns to numeric types, sorting rows, and formatting numeric fields for comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Spark DataFrames (base_dataframe, compare_dataframe) and environment import checks.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to Spark DataFrames via transformations, logs information, and performs type casting.",
  "flows": "Source: Spark DataFrame inputs; through functions that perform casting, sorting, and formatting; no external data or network communications involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of logging is standard; no unusual or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of helper functions for DataFrame comparison, primarily involving data transformations like casting string columns to numeric types, sorting rows for alignment, and formatting numeric fields. It uses standard Spark operations such as withColumn, orderBy, and row_number. Logging is used for informational purposes, and error handling checks for column mismatches. No data leakage, system manipulation, or malicious behavior is evident. There are no signs of obfuscation or malware. The functions are straightforward, and dependencies are limited to standard Spark libraries with optional import warning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module designed for DataFrame comparison within Spark environments. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It’s a standard implementation for data validation purposes without any suspicious activity.",
