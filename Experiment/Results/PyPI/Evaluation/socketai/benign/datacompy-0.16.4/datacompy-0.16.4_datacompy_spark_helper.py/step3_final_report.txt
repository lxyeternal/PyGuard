  "purpose": "Helper functions to compare Spark DataFrames based on row order, including handling string-to-double conversions, sorting, and formatting.",
  "sources": "DataFrame columns for type conversion, sorting, and formatting functions; internal data transformations.",
  "sinks": "Internal Spark DataFrame operations; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Type conversions and sorting functions process data from source columns to comparison outputs within Spark; no external flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns identified. Dependency warning is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Spark DataFrame manipulations: casting string columns to double, sorting rows, formatting numeric fields, and adding row number columns for comparison. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic. Dependency warning for missing 'pyspark' is benign. The functions are utility-focused and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for Spark DataFrame comparison and formatting, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (due to dependency warning, which is non-malicious).",
