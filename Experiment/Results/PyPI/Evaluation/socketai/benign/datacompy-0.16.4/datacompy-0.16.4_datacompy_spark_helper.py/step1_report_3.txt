{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for comparing and sorting PySpark DataFrames based on row order and column values, primarily for data validation tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Spark DataFrames, imports from pyspark.sql modules, logs warnings and info messages.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Uses input DataFrames and parameters to perform numeric conversion, sorting, and formatting operations; no external data sinks or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "Contains warning logs about missing dependencies but no malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions designed for data comparison and formatting in Spark environments. It handles data type conversions, row sorting, column sorting, and numeric formatting, all within standard data processing patterns. No network operations, external data leaks, or malicious code are present. The only noteworthy aspect is dependency warning, which is standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a helper module for data validation tasks in Spark workflows. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior are present. It is a typical, well-structured data processing utility with no security concerns.",
