{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for comparing Spark DataFrames, specifically for use cases where comparison is based on row order rather than column keys.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Spark DataFrames and column data, particularly during type conversions and sorting operations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written out, transmitted, or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames through type casting, sorting, and formatting functions, with no external network communication or untrusted data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard data comparison and formatting operations without obfuscation or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code offers helper functions for DataFrame comparison using Spark, including handling numeric string conversions, sorting by row order, and formatting numeric fields. It imports PySpark modules safely, with warnings if dependencies are missing. All functions perform standard data processing tasks and include proper exception handling for schema mismatches. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities are present. The logic is straightforward, and no external network activity or sensitive data handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for DataFrame comparison and formatting within Spark jobs. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The code's purpose is solely to support data comparison workflows, with no indications of supply chain sabotage.",
