{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for comparing Spark DataFrames, including handling numeric string conversions, sorting, and formatting for data comparison tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrames, optionally reads environment variables or configurations, and logs informational messages.",
  "sinks": "Uses DataFrame operations to transform data, logs info, and raises exceptions for mismatched columns.",
  "flows": "Inputs DataFrames -> Converts string columns to numeric -> Sorts rows -> Adds row number -> Compares DataFrames based on row order -> Formats numeric fields.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no obfuscated or unusual language features. The only potentially unusual aspect is the use of exception raising for column mismatches and the reliance on logging.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of utility functions for comparing Spark DataFrames in a data validation context. It includes safe DataFrame transformations, logging, and exception handling for column consistency. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity. The code performs data manipulation tasks typical for data comparison and quality checks without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its operations are standard DataFrame transformations and comparisons, with no suspicious external interactions beyond optional imports. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate helper functions for data comparison with no malicious intent. It performs safe data transformations and comparisons without any signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
