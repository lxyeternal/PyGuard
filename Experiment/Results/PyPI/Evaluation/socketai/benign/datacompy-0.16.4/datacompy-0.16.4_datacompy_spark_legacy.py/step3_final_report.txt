  "purpose": "Comparison of two Spark DataFrames for schema and data discrepancies, including detailed reporting on matching and mismatched rows, columns, and schema differences.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Spark DataFrames, particularly during comparison operations and when generating reports.",
  "sinks": "Outputs comparison summaries, mismatched rows, and column details via print statements; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows internally within Spark, from DataFrames to temporary views, SQL queries, and report printouts; no external data transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Uses standard Spark operations and SQL views.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Spark DataFrame comparison utility designed for schema and data validation. It employs typical Spark operations, temporary views, and SQL queries to identify differences. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or external system interactions are present. The logic is straightforward, and the purpose is data validation, not malicious activity. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Spark DataFrame comparison utility intended for data validation. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified by benign factors such as the use of dynamic SQL and caching, but these do not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
