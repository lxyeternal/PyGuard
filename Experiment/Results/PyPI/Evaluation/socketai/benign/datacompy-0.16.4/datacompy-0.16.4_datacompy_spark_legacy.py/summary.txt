  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Spark DataFrame comparison utility intended for data validation. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified by benign factors such as the use of dynamic SQL and caching, but these do not indicate actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis."
