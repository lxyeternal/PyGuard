{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Spark-based data comparison tool to identify differences and similarities between two DataFrames, including schema, row, and column value comparisons.",
  "sources": "The code reads input DataFrames (base_df and compare_df), metadata (column types), and user-supplied configurations such as join columns and known differences.",
  "sinks": "The code generates SQL queries and displays output reports to text files or stdout. It does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input DataFrames through comparison operations, with results stored in internal variables and optional caching. Report generation involves SQL queries and formatted output based on internal data states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard Spark SQL and DataFrame operations, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly compares Spark DataFrames, including schema, data, and row differences. It uses safe, well-known libraries and practices. No input sources are untrusted or insecurely handled. It does not perform network communication or modify external systems. All operations are standard data processing and reporting tasks with no hidden or malicious behavior. The only minor concern could be the use of cache and count operations, but these are typical for performance optimization in Spark. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured Spark DataFrame comparison utility. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It functions purely as a data comparison and reporting tool, with no harmful or unauthorized actions embedded.",
