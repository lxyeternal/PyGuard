  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class for comparing pandas DataFrames, serving as an interface with method signatures for validation, comparison, and reporting functions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; operates solely on DataFrame objects provided via class properties.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external sinks or transmitted over networks; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or output; method signatures and utility functions only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard abstract class with properties, abstract methods, and a utility function. It contains no data processing, external I/O, or network operations. The utility function safely generates unique temporary column names. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves as a framework for DataFrame comparison. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The license and copyright are standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for extension. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores in all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
