  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for comparing two Pandas DataFrames, with methods for validation, comparison, and reporting.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources are read; the code defines classes and functions only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points; no untrusted data output or network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code consists solely of class and function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code is standard for an abstract comparison class. The presence of the Apache license and copyright suggests legitimate intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'BaseCompare' intended for DataFrame comparison, with multiple abstract methods for validation, comparison, and reporting. It includes a utility function for generating temporary column names. There are no code execution, data leakage, or malicious patterns detected. The code appears to be well-structured, with standard Python practices and no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, non-malicious abstract class definition for DataFrame comparison, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
