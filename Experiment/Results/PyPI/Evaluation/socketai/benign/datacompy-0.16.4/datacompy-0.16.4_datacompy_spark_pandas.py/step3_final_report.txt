{
  "purpose": "The code provides a class for comparing two pandas-on-Spark DataFrames, generating detailed reports on their differences, overlaps, and mismatches, primarily for data validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrames (df1 and df2) passed during class instantiation; report templates read from files.",
  "sinks": "Generated report files (HTML or text) written locally; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames into comparison functions, with outputs as report files; no external untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a pandas version check that raises an exception if pandas >= 2.0.0, which is a compatibility enforcement, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data comparison utility with functions for validation, merging, comparison, and report rendering. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. The only notable behavior is the version check that raises an exception, which is a typical compatibility measure. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The code uses straightforward pandas-on-Spark operations and standard exception handling. The report templates are read from files, which could be tampered with but are not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is transparent, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe data validation and reporting utility with no malicious or obfuscated components. The minimal operational risk stems from the version enforcement check and report file writing, which are standard practices. No security risks or sabotage are evident.",
