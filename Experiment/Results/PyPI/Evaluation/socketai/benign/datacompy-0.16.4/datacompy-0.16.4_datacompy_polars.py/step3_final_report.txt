  "purpose": "A utility for comparing two Polars DataFrames, assessing differences, and generating human-readable reports on their similarities and discrepancies.",
  "sources": "Reads template files for report formatting; reads DataFrames passed as input; optional HTML report output file.",
  "sinks": "Writes report output to files; no network activity or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "DataFrames are compared internally; report templates are read from local files; report content is generated and optionally saved as HTML.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected; standard file I/O for report templates and output.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data validation, merging, comparison, and report generation using standard libraries. It does not include network calls, command execution, or data exfiltration. Functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The security-related signals are consistent with a benign data comparison utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent data comparison tool with no indications of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the benign nature of its operations.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
