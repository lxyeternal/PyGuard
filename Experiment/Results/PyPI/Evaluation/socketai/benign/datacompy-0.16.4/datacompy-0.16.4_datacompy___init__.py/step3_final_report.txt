  "purpose": "Package initialization for DataComPy, including environment checks, version warnings, and module imports.",
  "sources": "Python version checks, numpy version check, module imports, conditional import of SparkPandasCompare.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network communication, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Environment version checks trigger warnings; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Benign warnings about unsupported Python versions and numpy versions; no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script that performs environment compatibility checks and imports necessary modules. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. Warnings issued are benign and typical for environment compatibility. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious flows or data sinks. The malware score is correctly zero, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score is also zero, as the warnings do not pose actual security threats. The obfuscation score is zero, given the clear and standard code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
