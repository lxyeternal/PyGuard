  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compare two DataFrames (pandas or Fugue) for equality, overlap, and differences, supporting distributed processing and generating detailed reports.",
  "sources": "DataFrames read into the functions, optional dependencies (fugue.api, pyarrow, etc.), internal serialization with pickle for passing data between processes.",
  "sinks": "HTML report files, console output, internal data serialization/deserialization via pickle, logging warnings.",
  "flows": "DataFrames -> comparison functions -> internal serialization with pickle -> distributed processing -> report generation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for internal serialization/deserialization, which can be risky if data is untrusted; no external network activity or system modifications; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code compares DataFrames for equality, overlap, and mismatches, supporting local and distributed modes. It serializes comparison data using pickle, which is standard in distributed systems but can be dangerous if untrusted data is deserialized. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The optional dependency warning is benign. The functions are well-structured, and the logic aligns with typical data validation workflows. The primary security concern is pickle, but in this controlled context, it is acceptable. No external network activity or system modifications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate DataFrame comparison utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of pickle introduces a minor security risk if inputs are untrusted, but within a controlled environment, it is standard practice. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
