  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate DataFrame comparison utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of pickle introduces a minor security risk if inputs are untrusted, but within a controlled environment, it is standard practice. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
