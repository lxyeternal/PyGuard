{
  "purpose": "This package compares two pandas DataFrames and generates a human-readable report on their differences, akin to SAS PROC COMPARE.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrames (df1, df2), configuration parameters (like join_columns), and template files for report rendering.",
  "sinks": "Uses file I/O to save HTML reports; no other data sinks such as network connections or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input DataFrames into comparison functions; report generation involves rendering data and writing to a file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or backdoors identified. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data comparison operations using pandas, numpy, and custom functions. It validates dataframes, handles joins, and generates reports. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or secret storage found. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears consistent with standard data comparison tools, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured DataFrame comparison utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It responsibly handles data validation, comparison, and reporting without insecure practices or hidden malicious logic.",
