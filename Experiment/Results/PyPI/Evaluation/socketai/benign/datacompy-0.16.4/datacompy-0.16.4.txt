      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source data comparison utility for Snowflake environments. It contains no malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to standard file I/O for report templates. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero, and the low risk score (around 0.1) is justified. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and suitable for production use in data validation contexts."
