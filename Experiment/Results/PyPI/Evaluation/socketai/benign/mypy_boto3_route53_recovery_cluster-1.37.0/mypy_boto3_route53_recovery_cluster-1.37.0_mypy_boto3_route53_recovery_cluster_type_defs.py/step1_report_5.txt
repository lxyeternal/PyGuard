  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for route53-recovery-cluster service API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Module imports, sys.version_info checks, type definitions, and class attribute annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data could cause security issues or leaks; mainly type definitions.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., request parameters) flow into TypedDict classes, which are used for type annotations; no data processing or external effects shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for API request and response data structures using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no operations that process data dynamically, execute code, or perform I/O; it is purely type definitions. The import statements and conditional logic are standard for version compatibility and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of safe, standard type annotations for API data structures, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type definition module intended for static type checking.",
