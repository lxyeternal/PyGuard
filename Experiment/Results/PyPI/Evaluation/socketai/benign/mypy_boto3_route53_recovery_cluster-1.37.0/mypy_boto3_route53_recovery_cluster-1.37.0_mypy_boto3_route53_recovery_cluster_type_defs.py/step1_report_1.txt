  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the route53-recovery-cluster service in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, class declarations, and constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Type annotations define data shapes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is purely type definitions and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version, and class definitions using TypedDict to specify data structures for boto3 responses and requests. No runtime logic, external input processing, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are identified. The code appears to be standard for type hinting and documentation purposes in a SDK context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions and documentation snippets for boto3's route53 recovery cluster service. No malicious or security risks are present.",
