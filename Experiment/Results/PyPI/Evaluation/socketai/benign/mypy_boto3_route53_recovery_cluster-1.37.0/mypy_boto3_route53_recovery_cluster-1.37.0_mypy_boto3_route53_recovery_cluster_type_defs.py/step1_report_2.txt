{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for the route53-recovery-cluster service for boto3 stubs, enhancing type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code imports standard library modules, conditional imports based on Python version, and local module literals. No external input or data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present; the code solely defines type structures.",
  "flows": "The code establishes type definitions and imports, with no runtime data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors. The code strictly defines data types for type checking without executing any logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides typedDict class definitions for boto3 route53-recovery-cluster service, with conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It contains no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no potential data leakage mechanisms. The license and documentation comments do not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code functions purely as a static type definition module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static type definition module with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for type hinting support in Python projects.",
