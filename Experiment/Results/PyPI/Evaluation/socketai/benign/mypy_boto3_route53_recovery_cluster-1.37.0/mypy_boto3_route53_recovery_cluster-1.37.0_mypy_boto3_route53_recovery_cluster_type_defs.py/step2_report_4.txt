  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence presented, the logical consistency of the conclusions, and the scoring assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\nAll five reports describe the code as consisting solely of type annotations, data structure definitions, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation comments. They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Code Content:**  \n  The code contains only class definitions using `TypedDict`, conditional imports, and documentation strings. There are no functions, runtime logic, data processing, network operations, or input handling.\n\n- **Malicious Indicators:**  \n  No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious strings are present. The use of conditional imports based on `sys.version_info` is standard for maintaining compatibility, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n- **Data Flow & Sinks:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code is purely static type definitions meant for type checking.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion Consistency:**  \n  The reasoning in all reports is consistent and justified: the code is purely for static type hinting, documentation, and SDK support.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Evaluation:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification for Scores |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                | 0            | No malicious behavior or obfuscation. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                | 0            | Same reasoning. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                | 0            | No malicious indicators. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                | 0            | No suspicious behavior. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                | 0            | No security risks. |\n\nAll scores seem appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Potential for false positives:**  \n  Since the code is static type definitions, the risk of malware or obfuscation is extremely low. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports justify a higher risk score; the code is clearly benign.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Zero across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided reports and the code content:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**These are consistent with the evidence.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is purely static type definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and intended solely for static type checking within the SDK context.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe.",
