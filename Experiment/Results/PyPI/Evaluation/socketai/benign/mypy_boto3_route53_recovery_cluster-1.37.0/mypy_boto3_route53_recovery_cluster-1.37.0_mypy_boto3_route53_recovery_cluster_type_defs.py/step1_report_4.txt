  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for route53-recovery-cluster service type definitions in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys module, internal literals, builtins, collections.abc, typing, and typing_extensions; class definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data; no data leaks or external network operations; no use of eval, exec, or insecure data handling.",
  "flows": "Type definitions serve as data schemas; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info to conditionally import typing modules; all class definitions are straightforward data schemas without dynamic code execution or obfuscation; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type annotations for AWS Route53 Recovery Cluster API responses and requests. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. The classes extend TypedDict to define expected data structures, including optional fields. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious operations. The code appears to be purely for static type hinting and documentation, with no malicious behavior or security issues present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions intended for static analysis and documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious intent. It appears to be well-structured, version-compatible, and free of security risks.",
