  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type annotations and documentation for the route53-recovery-cluster service. No runtime logic, data processing, or external input handling is present. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code detected.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0 is appropriate. Risk score = 0 is justified since it's static type definitions with no security impact.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is static type annotations with compatibility considerations. No runtime or dynamic code, no data handling, no secrets.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0 is correct. Risk score = 0 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is static type definitions, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. No data processing or external inputs.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0 is correct. Risk score = 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides structured type annotations, uses conditional imports, and no dynamic or runtime logic. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0, risk score = 0 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type annotations, compatibility handling, no runtime logic, no data leaks.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score = 0, risk score = 0 are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static type definitions for boto3's route53-recovery-cluster service.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree that there's no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** No external data processing, no secrets, no code execution, no network operations, no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n- The code is benign, purely for type checking and documentation.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is safe, well-structured, and contains no security issues.",
