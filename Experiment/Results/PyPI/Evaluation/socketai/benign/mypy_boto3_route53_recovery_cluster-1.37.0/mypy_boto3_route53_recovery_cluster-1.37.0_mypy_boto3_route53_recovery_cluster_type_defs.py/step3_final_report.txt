  "purpose": "Type annotations for route53-recovery-cluster service type definitions.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions, class declarations, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, documentation strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external input, or runtime logic.",
  "flows": "N/A; purely static type annotations with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It includes documentation and no runtime logic, data handling, or network operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to provide static type hints for AWS SDK data structures, which is a benign and standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of static type definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are accurate and appropriate.",
