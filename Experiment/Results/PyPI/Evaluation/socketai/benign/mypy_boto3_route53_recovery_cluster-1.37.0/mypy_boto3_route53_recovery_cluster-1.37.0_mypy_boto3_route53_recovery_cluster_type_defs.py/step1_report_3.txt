  "purpose": "Type annotations for route53-recovery-cluster service type definitions used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, builtins, typing, and typing_extensions; code defining TypedDict classes for AWS SDK type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into TypedDict class definitions; no untrusted data sources or dangerous data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. Usage of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly type definitions with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It defines several TypedDict classes for AWS route53 recovery cluster operations. No user input handling, network operations, or data processing logic is present. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotations and documentation purposes, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard, well-structured type definition code for AWS SDK integration.",
