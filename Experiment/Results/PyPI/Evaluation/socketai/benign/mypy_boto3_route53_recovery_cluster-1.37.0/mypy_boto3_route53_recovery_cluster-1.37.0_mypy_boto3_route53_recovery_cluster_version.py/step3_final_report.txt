  "purpose": "Store the version information for the package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '1.37.0' to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from a string literal to __version__, no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string with a comment. No input handling, external data fetching, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as metadata-only, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward version declaration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The minor anomaly (future year) is irrelevant to security. The current scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
