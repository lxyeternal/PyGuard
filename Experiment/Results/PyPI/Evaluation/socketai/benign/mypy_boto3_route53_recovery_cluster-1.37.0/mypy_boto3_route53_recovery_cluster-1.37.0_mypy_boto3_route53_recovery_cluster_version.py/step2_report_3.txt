  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply assigns a version string to `__version__` with a copyright comment.\n   - No inputs, external data fetching, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as straightforward metadata, with no security issues or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score = 0\n     - `obfuscated` score = 0\n     - `securityRisk` score = 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.0, which is correct.\n   - The only noted anomaly (future year) does not translate into a security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n   - The code is purely metadata; no malware behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No questionable assumptions are made; all conclusions are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight but not a security concern.\n- The code is standard, widely used pattern for versioning in Python packages.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a trivial version declaration with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.",
