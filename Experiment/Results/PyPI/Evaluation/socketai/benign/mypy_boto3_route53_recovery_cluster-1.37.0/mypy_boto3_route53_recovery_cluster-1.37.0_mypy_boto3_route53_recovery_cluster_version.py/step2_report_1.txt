  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input handling, external data fetching, or complex logic is present.\n   - The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as straightforward and metadata-only.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score = 0\n     - `obfuscated` score = 0\n     - `securityRisk` score = 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports or the code itself justify a risk score higher than 0.5.\n   - The only potential concern is the future copyright year (2025), which is not a security issue.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to zero.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n   - **Confirmed:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is metadata-only.\n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable assignments are observed.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis is a straightforward version declaration file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed; the current scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
