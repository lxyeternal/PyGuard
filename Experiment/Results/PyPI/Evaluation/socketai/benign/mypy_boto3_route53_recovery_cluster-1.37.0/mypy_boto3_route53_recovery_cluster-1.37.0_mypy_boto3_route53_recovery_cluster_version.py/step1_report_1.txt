  "purpose": "Define the version of the module or package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no suspicious or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a string variable __version__ with a version number and includes a copyright statement. No input handling, external data fetching, or sensitive operations occur. The presence of a future copyright year is odd but not inherently malicious. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic version declaration with a seemingly incorrect copyright year. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
