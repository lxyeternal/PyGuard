  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscation. It correctly identifies that the code is primarily type annotations and SDK wrapper boilerplate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code, dynamic kwargs, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, highlights the code as a well-structured, type-annotated SDK wrapper with no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Continues the pattern of recognizing this as a standard SDK interface with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion: a typical, safe SDK wrapper with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No. All reports correctly identify the code as boilerplate SDK interface code.\n- **Obfuscation?** No. The code is clear, with no obfuscated or hidden elements.\n- **Risk scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious patterns.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?** None are made; the analysis is cautious and based on the code's actual content.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the thorough reviews, the code is a standard, well-structured SDK wrapper with no signs of security issues. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, and the provided reports are accurate in their assessments.",
