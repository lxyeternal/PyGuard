  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the AWS Route53 Recovery Cluster SDK wrapper, facilitating type-safe interactions with the service.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, class attributes, and imported type definitions; primarily from method signatures and type defs.",
  "sinks": "API call parameters and return values; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into AWS SDK calls; responses are returned directly or via type annotations, with no suspicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper with type annotations, method signatures, and exception classes. It delegates calls to the underlying AWS SDK without processing untrusted data or executing dynamic code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The structure is consistent with autogenerated or boilerplate SDK interface code, with high confidence in its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK interface for AWS Route53 Recovery Cluster, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. All scores are appropriately zero, reflecting its benign and straightforward nature.",
