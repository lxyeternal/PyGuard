{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for boto3 route53-recovery-cluster client.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data leading to security issues; primarily type annotations and class extension.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly defines a class structure with no dynamic data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses conditional imports based on Python version but that is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and a subclass for paginator functionality, with conditional import for 'Unpack' depending on Python version. It defines a class that extends a generic paginator with type hints, and includes docstrings with links to documentation. No data processing, network activity, or executable code that could be malicious is present. The structure appears standard and intended for type safety and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and class extension module for boto3 paginators, with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It primarily provides typing support and documentation links.",
