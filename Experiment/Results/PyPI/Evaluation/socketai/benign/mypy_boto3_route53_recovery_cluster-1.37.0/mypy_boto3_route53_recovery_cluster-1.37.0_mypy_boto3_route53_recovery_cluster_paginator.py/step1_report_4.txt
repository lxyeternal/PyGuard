  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for route53-recovery-cluster service client",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; no external data inputs",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands; standard paginator method override",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; method 'paginate' calls parent implementation without modification",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a type-safe paginator class for AWS route53-recovery-cluster, with conditional imports based on Python version. It includes standard class inheritance, type annotations, and documentation links. No external inputs, no data manipulation, and no suspicious logic are present. The purpose appears solely to provide type annotations and a wrapper for AWS SDK pagination.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and class definition module for a specific AWS service paginator, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
