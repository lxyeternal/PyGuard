{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for route53-recovery-cluster service client.",
  "sources": "The code reads from system version info (sys.version_info), imports from typing, botocore, and local modules, and defines a class method with **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present. The code does not send data over network, execute untrusted input, or write to files.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, defining a class that inherits from Paginator, and overriding the paginate method, which accepts keyword arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code primarily provides type annotations and a paginator class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a paginator class with type annotations for boto3 client. It conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version, uses type hints for safety, and extends Paginator with proper method override. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious, type-annotated paginator class for boto3, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
