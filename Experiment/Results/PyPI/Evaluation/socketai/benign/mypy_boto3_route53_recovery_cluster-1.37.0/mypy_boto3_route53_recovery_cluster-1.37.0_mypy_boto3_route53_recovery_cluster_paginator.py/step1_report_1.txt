  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class for the route53-recovery-cluster service client in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines a class for pagination, and type annotations; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external outputs; no malicious data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily defines a class structure with type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns; code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations for a boto3 paginator class, with conditional import for 'Unpack' based on Python version. It includes class inheritance and a method override for 'paginate', with detailed docstrings linking to documentation. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard type annotation and class definition for boto3 paginator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
