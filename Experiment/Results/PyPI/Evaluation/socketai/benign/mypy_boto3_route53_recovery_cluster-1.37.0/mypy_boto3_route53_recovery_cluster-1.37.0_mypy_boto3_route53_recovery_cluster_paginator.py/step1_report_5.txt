{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for route53-recovery-cluster service client in boto3, with documentation and type checking support.",
  "sources": "The code reads version info from sys.version_info, imports from standard library (sys, typing), imports from botocore.paginate, and local type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs are present. The code only sets up type annotations, imports, and class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The code primarily defines a class with a method that returns an iterator.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard type annotation and class setup code, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a paginator class inheriting from a generic Paginator, with conditional import based on Python version for type annotations. It includes detailed docstrings with links to documentation, and uses type hints for method signatures. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors. The imports are standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation patterns are present. The overall structure aligns with typical type-stub or API client setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured type annotation and paginator class definition for boto3, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily serves as a type hinting aid, documentation, and class wrapper.",
