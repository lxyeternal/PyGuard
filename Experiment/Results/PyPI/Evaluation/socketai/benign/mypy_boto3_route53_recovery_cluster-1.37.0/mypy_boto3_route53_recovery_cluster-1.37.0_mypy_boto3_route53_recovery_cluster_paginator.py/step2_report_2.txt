  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely for type annotations and class structure, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — all reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to report 1, it describes standard class inheritance, type annotations, and conditional imports based on Python version, with no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is straightforward, providing type annotations and documentation links without any external data handling or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar pattern, standard class extension, type annotations, and documentation links, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0; the code is purely for static type checking and documentation support, with no external data handling or security-sensitive operations.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate; the code is standard, safe, and intended solely for type annotations and documentation.
