  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class for boto3 route53-recovery-cluster service client, providing static typing support and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines class inheritance, conditional import of 'Unpack' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No external data, user input, network activity, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and method override with type annotations, no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static type stub for boto3 paginator classes, including conditional imports for compatibility, with documentation links. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The class extends a generic paginator, overrides the 'paginate' method with type hints, and is well-documented. All indicators point to benign, purely structural code intended for static type checking and SDK documentation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for type annotations and SDK wrappers, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
