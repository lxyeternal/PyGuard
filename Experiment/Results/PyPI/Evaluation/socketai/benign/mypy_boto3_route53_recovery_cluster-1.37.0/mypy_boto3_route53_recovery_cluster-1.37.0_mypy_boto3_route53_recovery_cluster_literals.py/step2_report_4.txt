  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code defines static string literals for AWS Route53 Recovery Cluster service and related names for type annotations. No untrusted data, no dynamic behavior, no malicious intent.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the static, benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no security issues.  \n- **Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward static type definition module for AWS SDKs, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on static string literals for AWS services, primarily for type checking. No external data, no runtime logic.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — benign static definitions.  \n- **Conclusion:** Purely static, safe, and intended for type safety.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Defines string literals for AWS resource and service names, with version-aware imports. No dynamic code or external data.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — static constants only.  \n- **Conclusion:** Static type annotations, no security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar static definitions, with no runtime logic or external dependencies.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — purely static data.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, static type annotation module.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same pattern—static string literals for AWS resource names, no dynamic or external data.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — static, safe definitions.  \n- **Conclusion:** Static, safe, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is purely static, defining string literals for type annotations related to AWS services and resources.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected in any report. The code contains no executable logic, no network or file operations, no dynamic code, and no external data processing.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Security risk:** Zero. The code serves as a static type annotation utility, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any security issues, the overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a benign, static type annotation module for AWS SDKs, with no malicious or security concerns. It effectively improves code correctness without introducing any risks.",
