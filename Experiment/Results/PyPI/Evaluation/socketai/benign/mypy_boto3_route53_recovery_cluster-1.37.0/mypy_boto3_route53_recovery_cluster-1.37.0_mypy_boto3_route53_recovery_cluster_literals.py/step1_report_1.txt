  "purpose": "Define string literals for AWS Route53 Recovery Cluster service and related resource and paginator names for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and conditional import of Literal, assignment of literal string types to variables, and large tuple of string literals.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources, no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; code only defines constants and types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables. The license and copyright note are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It defines several type alias variables as string literal types for use in type annotations. The large list of AWS resource and service names appears to be static data for type checking, with no dynamic or external data manipulation. No network activity, file access, or code execution is present. The code appears to be a straightforward, static type annotation module intended to improve code correctness and clarity when using boto3 AWS SDK, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static, defining string literals for AWS resource and service names for type annotations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or other security threats. It appears to be a benign, well-structured type definition module.",
