  "purpose": "Define type annotations for string literal values representing AWS resource and service names related to Route53 recovery cluster and other AWS services.",
  "sources": "String literals defining various AWS service and resource names, imported modules for version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs; code purely defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; type definitions are static and not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The code only includes static string literals and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type aliases for string literals used to identify AWS services and resource types. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a common pattern. All string literals are standard identifiers for AWS services, and there is no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The copyright notice is benign and aligns with typical open-source documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for AWS resource identifiers. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or network activities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code snippet.",
