{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literal constants used in the route53-recovery-cluster service for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and defines string literal constants.",
  "sinks": "None; the code solely defines constants and does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not contain executable data flows, input/output handling, or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward type annotation definitions with standard imports and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with importing sys and conditionally importing Literal based on Python version, which is standard. It then defines a set of string literal types used for type annotations in boto3 service stub definitions. All variables are constants representing literal strings, and there is no dynamic execution, no input processing, or suspicious constructs. The large list of service names and resource names is static and appears to be for type checking purposes only. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type annotation module intended for type safety in boto3 service stubs. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
