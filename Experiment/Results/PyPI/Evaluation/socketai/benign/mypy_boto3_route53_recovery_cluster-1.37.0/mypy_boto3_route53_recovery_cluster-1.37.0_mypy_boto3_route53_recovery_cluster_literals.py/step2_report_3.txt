  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as static type annotations defining string literal constants for AWS service/resource names.\n- The code includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data processing, network activity, or I/O operations are present.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving to improve type safety and code clarity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literals for AWS Route53 Recovery Cluster and related resources.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; static definitions only.\n- **Security assessment:** No issues; malware score 0, risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type annotations for AWS services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external data or dynamic behavior; purely static.\n- **Security assessment:** No issues; malware score 0, risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literals for AWS route53-recovery-cluster.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static constants, no runtime logic.\n- **Security assessment:** No issues; malware score 0, risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type annotations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or dynamic behavior.\n- **Security assessment:** No issues; malware score 0, risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—type annotations for AWS resource names.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static, safe definitions.\n- **Security assessment:** No issues; malware score 0, risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Code Content:** Purely static type alias definitions for string literals.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** None; no external data, no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** None; the code is straightforward and benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and risk scores as 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is a static type annotation module, with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My Personal Estimate**\n\nConsidering all the above, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, static type definition module for AWS resource and service name literals. No malicious or security issues are present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
