  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS Route53 Recovery Cluster service and related resource names for static type annotations.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to variables; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flow; static constants used solely for type safety.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static data, no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static type annotations using Literal for AWS resource and service names, with conditional import for Python version compatibility. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. The purpose is to provide type safety and code clarity in boto3 stubs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module defining string literals for AWS resource names, serving as type annotations. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation or malicious intent.",
