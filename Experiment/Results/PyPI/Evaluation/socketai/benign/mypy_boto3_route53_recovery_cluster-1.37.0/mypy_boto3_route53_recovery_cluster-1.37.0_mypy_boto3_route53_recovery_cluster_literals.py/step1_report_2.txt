{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and literals for AWS Route53 Recovery Cluster service and other AWS services, primarily for type checking and code completion purposes.",
  "sources": "The source of data is mainly static definitions: string literals assigned to variables, imported type hints, and the sys module for version checking.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code does not process external inputs or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; the code solely establishes constants and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code contains straightforward static definitions and conditional imports based on Python version. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'sys' to check Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It defines a series of string literal types for various AWS service names and resource identifiers to facilitate type checking. The variables are simple assignments of string literals to type aliases. The code appears well-structured, with clear purpose. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It is a static type annotation module with no runtime logic beyond import management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static type definition for AWS service name literals, intended for type safety and documentation. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a benign utility module with no dynamic or insecure behaviors.",
