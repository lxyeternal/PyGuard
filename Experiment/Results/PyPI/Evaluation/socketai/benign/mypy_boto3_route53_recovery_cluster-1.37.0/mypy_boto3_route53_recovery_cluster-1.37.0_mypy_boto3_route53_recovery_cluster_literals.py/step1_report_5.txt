  "purpose": "Define type annotations for string literals used in the route53-recovery-cluster service for better type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions, and definition of string literal constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable operations; code primarily defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code consists of static type definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior; code is purely for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system version info, conditionally imports 'Literal' for type annotations, and defines numerous string literal constants for various AWS services and resource names. No runtime logic, data processing, or external input handling is present. It includes extensive lists of AWS service names as type literals, which are safe and standard for type safety. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking with clear, predefined string literal types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS service and resource names, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data or include any suspicious behavior, serving solely as type annotation helpers.",
