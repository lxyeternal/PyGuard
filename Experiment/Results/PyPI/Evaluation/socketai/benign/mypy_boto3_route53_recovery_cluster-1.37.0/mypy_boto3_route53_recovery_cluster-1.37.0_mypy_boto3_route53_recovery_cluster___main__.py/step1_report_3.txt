{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface entry point that outputs package information or version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes output to standard output (sys.stdout).",
  "sinks": "Uses sys.stdout.write to output static strings; no untrusted data is written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (argv) triggers output functions that print static information; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print static package information and version, and a main function to handle a command-line argument for version display. The behavior is straightforward and solely involves outputting predefined static strings. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or interaction with external malicious domains.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a benign CLI utility that provides package info and version details. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
