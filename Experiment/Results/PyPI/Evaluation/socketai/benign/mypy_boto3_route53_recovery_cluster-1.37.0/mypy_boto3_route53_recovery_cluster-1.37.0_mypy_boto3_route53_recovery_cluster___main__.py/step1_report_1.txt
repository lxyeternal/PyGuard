  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script that outputs package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) leads to conditional logic that triggers printing version or package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code structures. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script simply checks for '--version' in command-line arguments to print version info; otherwise, it prints static package info. There are no external data sources, no network connections, no file access, and no data processing beyond simple output. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package metadata and version information. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
