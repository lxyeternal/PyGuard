  "purpose": "CLI utility for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (user input), sys.stdout (output functions)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), print_version and print_info functions",
  "flows": "User input (via command-line args) triggers print_version; otherwise, print_info is called.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no external data fetching or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that provides package info and version details. It imports sys, defines two simple print functions, and a main function that checks command-line arguments. The control flow is simple and predictable, with no dynamic code execution, no external network calls, and no handling of untrusted data beyond argument checking. The script does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. It is a standard utility script with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility for displaying static package information. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
