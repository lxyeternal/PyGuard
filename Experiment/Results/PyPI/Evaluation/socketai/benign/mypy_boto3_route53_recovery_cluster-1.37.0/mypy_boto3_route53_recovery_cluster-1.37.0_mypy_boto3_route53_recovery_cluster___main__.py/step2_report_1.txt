  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The script is a straightforward CLI utility.\n- It checks for the '--version' argument to print version info.\n- Otherwise, it prints static package information.\n- It uses only standard library modules (`sys`).\n- There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscation, external data fetching, or network activities.\n- The copyright date is in the future (2025), which may be a typo or placeholder but doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present. The code functions as intended, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware presence:** None. The code only outputs static information.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n### Review of each report:\nAll five reports uniformly conclude that the script is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious activity. Their reasoning is consistent and based on the code's simplicity.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports give 0.0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports give 0.0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports give 0.0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports are accurate; the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all conclusions are based on static analysis.\n- The confidence level is 1.0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The future copyright year is likely a typo or placeholder but does not affect security.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational, with no side effects.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No action needed; the code is safe.",
