  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a straightforward CLI utility.\n- It imports `sys`.\n- Defines `print_info()` to output static package info.\n- Defines `print_version()` to output the version.\n- The `main()` function checks for `--version` argument; if present, prints version, else prints info.\n- No external data, network, or dynamic code execution.\n- No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is benign, and the reports correctly identify that.  \n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  None found; the reports correctly note the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Review of the Scores:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- All reports assign `0.0`, which is consistent with the code's behavior—no malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious payloads.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- All reports assign `0.0`, which is accurate.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- All reports assign `0.0`. Given the benign nature, this seems appropriate.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), which aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n- No report claims any suspicious behavior or potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future. This could be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't impact security.\n- No dynamic code, no external dependencies, no network activity.\n- The script performs only static output based on command-line arguments.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | **0.0**           | No malicious activity, no suspicious code patterns.                         |\n| Obfuscated    | **0.0**           | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                            |\n| Security Risk   | **0.0**           | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or dangerous behavior.                        |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks or malware present.** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n- The reports are thorough and correctly conclude no malicious or risky behavior.\n- No adjustments needed to scores.\n- The code is a simple, safe CLI utility.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual behavior and the detailed analysis provided.",
