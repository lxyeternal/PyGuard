  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Confirmation:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package info or version.\n- No dynamic code, no external data sources, no network activity, no file I/O, no obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- The code is straightforward, with simple conditional logic based on command-line arguments.\n\n**2. Issues in the Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and has no malicious behavior.\n- The analysis correctly states that the script only prints static information and does not perform any suspicious actions.\n- No issues are present in the code, and the reasoning is consistent.\n\n**3. Score Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0.0\n  - obfuscated: 0.0\n  - securityRisk: 0.0\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), which aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n**4. Justification of Risk Scores:**\n- Since the code does not perform any malicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0.0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0.0, as the code is clear and readable.\n- The overall security risk is 0.0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**5. Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they only describe the code's behavior.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unsupported assumptions.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational, with no side effects.\n\n**6. Consistency and Validity:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates based on the review, I would concur with the existing scores. There is no evidence to suggest malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as-is.",
