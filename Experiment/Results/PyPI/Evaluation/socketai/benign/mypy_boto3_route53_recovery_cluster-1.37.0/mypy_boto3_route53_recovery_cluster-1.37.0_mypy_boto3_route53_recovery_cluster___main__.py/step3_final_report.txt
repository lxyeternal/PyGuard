  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout (`sys.stdout.write`).",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (`--version`) leads to printing version; otherwise, prints package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The copyright year is future-dated (2025), likely a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static information based on command-line input. It uses only standard library modules (`sys`) with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data fetching. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. All logic is static and clear, with no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, straightforward, and safe. It performs only static output without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
