  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint script that outputs package information or version details to stdout.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs information).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data that could be viewed or captured), sys.argv (reads user input).",
  "flows": "User supplies command-line argument; if '--version' present, version info is output; otherwise, package info is output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity, and no malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command-line arguments to determine whether to output version or package info. It uses standard library functions with no external or network activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The copyright date is in the future, but this is likely a placeholder or typo and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package information and version, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
