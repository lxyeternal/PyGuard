{
  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a package, including its version and details about boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, and reading sys.argv for input.",
  "flows": "User runs script -> script checks sys.argv -> if '--version' present, calls print_version, else calls print_info -> outputs information to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs basic CLI operations: checking for a specific argument ('--version') and printing package info or version to stdout. It uses standard libraries and straightforward control flow. No data is read from untrusted sources beyond command-line arguments. No data leakage, malicious code, or backdoors are evident. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no side effects or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package information with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
