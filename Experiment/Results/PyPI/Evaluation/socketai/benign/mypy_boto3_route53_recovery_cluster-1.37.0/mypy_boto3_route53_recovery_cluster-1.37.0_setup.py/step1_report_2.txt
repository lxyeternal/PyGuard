  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-route53-recovery-cluster package to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools; uses hardcoded strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration for packaging. It reads static metadata, includes dependencies, and specifies package data. There are no input or output streams involving untrusted data. No code execution, network activity, or data collection mechanisms are present. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious elements.",
