  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the setup script and the content of the reports.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads a README.md for the long description.\n- It specifies package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, URLs, and package data.\n- There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or suspicious code patterns.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script, with confidence scores of 1.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly implements a typical setup script.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security risks:** None detected; the script is static and standard.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None; no untrusted input, code execution, or network activity.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports or the code.\n- The dependency specification `'typing-extensions; python_version<\"3.12\"'` is standard for conditional dependencies.\n\n### Scores and justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, consistent with the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Potential issues based on assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all analyses correctly identify the script as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard package setup script.\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed in the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The script is a normal, benign Python packaging configuration with no security issues or malicious behavior.",
