{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'mypy-boto3-route53-recovery-cluster'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description; reads package metadata and dependencies from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or network communication occurs within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> passes data to setup() -> completes package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard setup procedures with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for file handling and setuptools for package setup. It reads a markdown file for the long description and then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are identified. The dependencies and URLs are standard and relate to documentation or source repositories. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply prepares the package for distribution with standard practices.",
