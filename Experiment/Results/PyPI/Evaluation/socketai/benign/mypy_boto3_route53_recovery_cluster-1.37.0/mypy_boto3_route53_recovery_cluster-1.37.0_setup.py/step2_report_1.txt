  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe a standard Python `setup.py` script.\n- No dynamic or untrusted input handling, no network activity, no environment variable manipulation.\n- No obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n- The risk scores are all 0 or very low, consistent with the benign description.\n- The code's purpose is purely package configuration, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and typical for a Python package setup script.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no code, network, or data flow indicates malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent; no secrets, no dynamic code, no external inputs.\n\n### Specific points:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the script.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** No changes needed; all are consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:** Not applicable here, as all evidence points to no risk.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0, code is clear.\n- **Overall security assessment:** The script is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis setup script is a standard, benign package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are consistent, and the scores reflect the actual content accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threat. No further action or concern is necessary.",
