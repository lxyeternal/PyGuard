  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-route53-recovery-cluster library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md for long description; static metadata in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It reads a local file for description and calls setup() with fixed arguments. No dynamic input, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The dependency specification is standard, and no secrets or untrusted data are involved. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code's purpose is solely package configuration, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. No further action is necessary.",
