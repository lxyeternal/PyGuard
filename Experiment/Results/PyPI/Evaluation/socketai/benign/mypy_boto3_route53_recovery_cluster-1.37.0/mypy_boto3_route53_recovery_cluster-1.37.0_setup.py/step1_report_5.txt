{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of the mypy-boto3-route53-recovery-cluster Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setuptools for packaging; reads environment via Python's standard library (Path); uses static string data for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks present; no external data is processed or transmitted within this script.",
  "flows": "The script primarily reads local files and defines static package metadata, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code is straightforward, with standard setup configurations and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and uses a common setup pattern to define package metadata, dependencies, and configurations. It reads a local README file for description and specifies dependencies with version conditions. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. All code appears standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs no data processing or transmission and contains only static configuration data.",
