  "purpose": "Calculate dimensions related to a book cover layout based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned at the beginning (page_count, bleed) and the print statements that output calculated dimensions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output calculated values; no untrusted data or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Calculation of spine_width from page_count, then use of these variables in print statements to display dimensions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Python 2 style print statements without parentheses; no suspicious or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes variables related to book cover dimensions, performs simple arithmetic calculations, and outputs the results via print statements. There is no external input, no data leakage, no code injection, or insecure handling of data. The calculations are straightforward, and the print statements serve informational purposes. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward script for calculating and displaying book cover dimensions. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
