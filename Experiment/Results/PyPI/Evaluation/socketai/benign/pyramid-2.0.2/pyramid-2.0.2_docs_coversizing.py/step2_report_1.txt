  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code performs static calculations with hardcoded values; no external input, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility script for layout calculations.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward calculations, static data, no external dependencies or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—simple arithmetic, static constants, no external input or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and straightforward.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous reports—simple, static calculations with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—benign, static calculations, no external data or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network communication, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely computational and outputting static measurements, the risk is negligible. All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a simple utility script for layout calculations based on fixed parameters.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are justified.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and secure. No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.",
