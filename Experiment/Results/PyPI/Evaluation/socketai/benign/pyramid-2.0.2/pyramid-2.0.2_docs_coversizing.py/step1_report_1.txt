  "purpose": "Calculate dimensions related to book cover layout, including spine width, minimum cover dimensions, and barcode placement.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants and variables such as page_count, bleed, spine_width, trim_width, trim_height, and fixed dimension values for barcode placement.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or output functions that process external or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are initialized with static, hardcoded values. The code uses print statements for output. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script computes dimensions based on fixed inputs related to print layout parameters. It uses straightforward arithmetic calculations and prints static dimension values. There is no evidence of input handling, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution. The constants and calculations are consistent with layout design purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple layout calculation script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs static computations and outputs layout measurements without involving external data or sensitive operations.",
