  "purpose": "Calculate dimensions related to book cover design, including spine width, minimum cover size, and barcode placement.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded values for page count, bleed, and fixed dimensions within the code.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting calculated dimensions and fixed measurements; no data leakage or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded constants) are used to compute values, then results are printed; no flow of untrusted data or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic; code is straightforward dimension calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several parameters related to print layout, performs simple arithmetic calculations for dimensions, and outputs these values via print statements. It relies solely on hardcoded constants with no external input or sensitive data handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, external connections, or backdoors are present. The code serves a specific utility purpose in design calculations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script for calculating book cover dimensions. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
