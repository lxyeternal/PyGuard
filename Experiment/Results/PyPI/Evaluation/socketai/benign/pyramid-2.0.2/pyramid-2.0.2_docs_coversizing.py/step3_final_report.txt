  "purpose": "Calculate book cover dimensions and layout instructions based on fixed parameters such as page count, bleed, and trim sizes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants within the script (page_count, bleed, spine_width, trim_width, trim_height). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements; no data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Calculations of spine_width, min_cover_width, min_cover_height flow from static constants; output is straightforward print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is simple, static, and straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static calculations for layout dimensions using fixed parameters. It outputs measurements for cover width, height, spine width, and barcode placement. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is clear, readable, and purpose-specific. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static utility for layout calculations with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safety and simplicity. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
