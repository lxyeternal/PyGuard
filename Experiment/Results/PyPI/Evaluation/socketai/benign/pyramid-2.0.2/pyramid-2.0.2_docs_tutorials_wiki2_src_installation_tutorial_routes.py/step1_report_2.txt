  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or system effect",
  "flows": "No input-to-output data flow; the code sets configuration parameters only",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function includeme that configures static assets and a route in a web application. It uses the provided config object to set up static file serving with caching and to define the home route. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows that could be exploited. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code appears standard for configuring web app routes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard web application configuration without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears safe and unremarkable in terms of security concerns.",
