  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or data; configuration parameters are static values.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; configuration values are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'includeme' that sets up static file serving and routing configurations. It uses static values and functions typical of a web framework setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard configuration code for a web application and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
