  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration snippet setting static view cache and a route. No input processing, external data, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is negligible (0), consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. All assessments are accurate; no modifications needed.",
