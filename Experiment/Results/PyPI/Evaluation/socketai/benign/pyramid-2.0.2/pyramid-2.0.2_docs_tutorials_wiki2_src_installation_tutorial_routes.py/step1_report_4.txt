  "purpose": "Configure static view and routing for a web application framework",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input or external data",
  "sinks": "None that pose a security risk or could leak data directly",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The function 'includeme' sets up static file serving and route configuration, typical for web frameworks like Pyramid. No external inputs, environment variables, or sensitive data handling are present. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified. The code appears straightforward and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet for a web framework with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
