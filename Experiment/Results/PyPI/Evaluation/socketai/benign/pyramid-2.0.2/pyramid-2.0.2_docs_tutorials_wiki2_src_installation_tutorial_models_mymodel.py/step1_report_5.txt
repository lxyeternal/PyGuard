  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model for the 'models' table with indexing.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy and a local meta module; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "Database schema creation, index declaration.",
  "flows": "Class definition flows into table creation and index setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no unusual patterns. The index length specification is standard for string indexing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary SQLAlchemy components to define a database model. It creates a class 'MyModel' inheriting from 'Base', with three columns: id, name, and value. The 'id' is a primary key, 'name' is a text field, and 'value' is an integer. An index 'my_index' is created on 'name' with a uniqueness constraint. All components appear to be standard ORM model definitions with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external inputs, and no suspicious dynamic behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition for a database table with an index. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The code appears safe and typical for database schema setup.",
