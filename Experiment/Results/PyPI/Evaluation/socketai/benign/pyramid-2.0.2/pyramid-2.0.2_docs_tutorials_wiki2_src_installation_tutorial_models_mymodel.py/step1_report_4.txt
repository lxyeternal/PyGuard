  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy ORM model with a unique index on the 'name' field",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy, class definition, attribute declarations, index creation",
  "sinks": "Database operations via SQLAlchemy ORM, index creation, and class metadata",
  "flows": "Class definition and attribute declarations lead to ORM table creation; index applied to 'name' field",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated or dynamic execution; standard ORM usage",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple ORM model with basic fields and a unique index on the 'name' column. It uses standard SQLAlchemy patterns without any input from external sources, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations. The index creation is straightforward and does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a typical data model definition for database interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ORM model definition for a database table with a unique index. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
