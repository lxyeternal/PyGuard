  "purpose": "Define SQLAlchemy ORM base class with a specific naming convention for database schema elements.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (sqlalchemy.ext.declarative and sqlalchemy.schema) and the NAMING_CONVENTION dictionary.",
  "sinks": "MetaData instantiation and declarative_base creation, which influence database schema generation.",
  "flows": "Imports -> NAMING_CONVENTION -> MetaData -> declarative_base -> ORM base class creation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The code follows standard SQLAlchemy practices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a schema naming convention for SQLAlchemy ORM, which helps in consistent database migrations. It uses standard library imports and defines a clear, readable dictionary for naming conventions. No data input, external data sources, or dynamic code execution is present. The pattern is typical for setting up database schema definitions with Alembic, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for SQLAlchemy ORM with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It primarily helps in database schema management and migration consistency.",
