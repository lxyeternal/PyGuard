  "purpose": "Define SQLAlchemy declarative base with a specific naming convention for database schema elements to facilitate consistent migrations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative and sqlalchemy.schema, and the NAMING_CONVENTION dictionary.",
  "targets": "The creation of 'metadata' and 'Base' objects for ORM mappings, and their usage in database schema generation.",
  "flows": "Imports → NAMING_CONVENTION → metadata → Base declaration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected. The code adheres to standard SQLAlchemy practices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a SQLAlchemy base class with a specified naming convention for schema objects, which is a common practice to ensure consistent database migrations. No data input or output, no execution of untrusted data, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The code appears to be purely for ORM schema definition setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup for SQLAlchemy ORM schema definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
