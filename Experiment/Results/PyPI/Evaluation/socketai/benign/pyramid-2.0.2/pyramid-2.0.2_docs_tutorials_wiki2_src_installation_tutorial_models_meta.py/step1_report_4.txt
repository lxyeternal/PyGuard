  "purpose": "Define SQLAlchemy declarative base with a custom naming convention for database schema elements to facilitate migrations and maintain consistency across different database providers.",
  "sources": "Import statements for SQLAlchemy modules; the NAMING_CONVENTION dictionary defining naming patterns.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code; it does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code sets up metadata and base classes for ORM models but does not involve data flow or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary SQLAlchemy components to define a base class for ORM models and sets a naming convention dictionary aligned with Alembic best practices. It creates a MetaData instance with this naming convention and then defines a declarative base class. The code is clean, well-documented, and follows standard practices for schema migrations. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM models with a focus on schema migration stability. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
