  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe standard SQLAlchemy setup code: defining a naming convention, creating a MetaData object, and a declarative base class.\n- No report mentions dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or embedded secrets.\n- The code is straightforward, well-documented, and aligns with best practices for schema migration consistency.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, aligns with SQLAlchemy standards, and serves its purpose of setting up ORM schema definitions with consistent naming conventions.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security risk:** No evident security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Issue detection:\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any issues in the code. The code is standard and benign.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign `0` (or very close), which matches the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerability, a high risk score isn't justified.\n- The reports' scores are consistent with their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent in their evaluations.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, well-implemented setup for SQLAlchemy ORM schema management with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
