  "purpose": "Define SQLAlchemy ORM base class with a custom naming convention for database schema objects to facilitate migrations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sqlalchemy for declarative base and metadata; assignment of NAMING_CONVENTION dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data handling, input/output, or external communication in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical points; the code only sets up schema conventions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard schema setup with recommended practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary SQLAlchemy components to create a declarative base class with a custom naming convention, which is used to standardize database object names. It includes a NAMING_CONVENTION dictionary, a best practice for database migrations, and assigns it to metadata before creating the base class. There is no input/output handling, no execution of untrusted code, and no embedded secrets or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a typical setup for ORM mappings and schema migrations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration snippet for SQLAlchemy ORM setup, aimed at improving migration consistency. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
