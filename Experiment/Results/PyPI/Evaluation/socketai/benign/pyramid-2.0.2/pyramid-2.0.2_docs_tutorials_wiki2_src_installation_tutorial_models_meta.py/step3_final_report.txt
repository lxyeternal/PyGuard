  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy declarative base with a consistent naming convention for schema elements to facilitate database migrations.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data for naming conventions and imports modules for ORM setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules -> defines naming conventions -> creates MetaData -> initializes declarative base.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM, establishing a declarative base with a specific naming convention to ensure consistent schema element names across database providers. It imports necessary modules, defines a static naming convention dictionary, creates a MetaData object with this convention, and then creates a declarative base class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not handle untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or include secrets. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, configuration nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM schema management, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports correctly assess the code as safe, and the scores reflect this assessment.",
