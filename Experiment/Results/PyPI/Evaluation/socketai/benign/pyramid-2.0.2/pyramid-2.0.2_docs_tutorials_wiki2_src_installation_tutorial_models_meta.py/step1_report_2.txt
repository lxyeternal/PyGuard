  "purpose": "Define SQLAlchemy declarative base with a specific naming convention for database schema objects.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative and sqlalchemy.schema; usage of naming convention dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or data flow leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> creation of naming convention -> initialization of metadata and base class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard SQLAlchemy setup code with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up SQLAlchemy's declarative base with a specified naming convention aimed at aiding migration management. It uses standard libraries and constructs without any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or hidden behaviors. The naming convention aligns with best practices, and no untrusted input or data flows are evident. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for SQLAlchemy ORM mapping with a focus on consistent naming conventions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security vulnerabilities.",
