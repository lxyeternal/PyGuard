  "purpose": "Set up and return a Pyramid WSGI web application with specified configurations and included modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pyramid.config' and the 'main' function parameters 'global_config' and 'settings'.",
  "sinks": "The 'config.include' and 'config.scan()' calls, which load additional modules and perform scanning.",
  "flows": "The 'main' function initializes a Configurator, includes modules ('pyramid_jinja2', '.routes', '.models'), performs scanning, then returns the WSGI app.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious domain connections or data exfiltration code present. The code appears to be standard Pyramid app setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a typical Pyramid application factory function. It imports configuration tools, includes standard modules, and performs configuration scanning. All operations are typical for web application setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious flows. The included modules '.routes' and '.models' are relative and not inherently suspicious; their contents are unknown but assumed standard. No sensitive data handling or insecure operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pyramid application setup function with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It performs typical configuration tasks for a web app. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
