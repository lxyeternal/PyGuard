  "purpose": "Set up configuration and dependencies for a Python web application package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.txt' and 'CHANGES.txt' files; importing os, setuptools, and find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flows leading to external systems identified.",
  "flows": "File reads for documentation, package discovery, and setup configuration; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. All code performs standard setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads documentation files, defines dependencies, and configures package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no handling of user input or environment variables. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present. The script appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration for a web application package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a standard package configuration file with no evidence of malware or malicious behaviors.",
