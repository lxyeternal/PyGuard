  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python web application package, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.txt' and 'CHANGES.txt' files for long description.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "File reads for README and CHANGES files are straightforward; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static setup configuration: reading documentation files, defining dependencies, and setting package metadata. The dependencies are standard for a web application, with no suspicious packages. No user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices, indicating a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
