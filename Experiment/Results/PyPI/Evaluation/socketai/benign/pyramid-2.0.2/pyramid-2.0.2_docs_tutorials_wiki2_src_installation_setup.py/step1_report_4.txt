  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python web application package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.txt' and 'CHANGES.txt' files for long description; loads dependencies from predefined lists; defines package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted data; no sinks for malicious data flow are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no untrusted data sources or flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and third-party dependencies, reads documentation files for description, and configures package installation parameters. It sets up dependencies, metadata, and entry points for package installation and application factory. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python web project, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
