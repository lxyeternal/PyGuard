  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a web application, defining dependencies, reading documentation files, and setting entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads static files ('README.txt', 'CHANGES.txt'), defines dependencies, and specifies entry points; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks involving untrusted data; no network activity, user input, or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Static file reading and configuration data; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script performing package configuration tasks. It reads static documentation files, declares dependencies, and sets entry points. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling. The code adheres to standard practices and contains no suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 or near-zero, which are appropriate given the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
