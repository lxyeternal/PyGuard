  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators:**\n   - All reports consistently indicate that the code is a standard setup.py script performing package configuration tasks.\n   - No suspicious code, dynamic execution, external data injection, or obfuscation is observed.\n   - The code reads static files, defines dependencies, and sets entry points—all typical and benign activities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are identified in the reports.\n   - The code appears correctly structured and follows common Python packaging practices.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0 or very close to 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, focusing instead on static analysis.\n   - No claims are made about hidden malicious intent, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, standard setup script.\n   - No signs of supply chain threats, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll evidence points to a safe, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.",
