  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.5 (since no issues).  \n- **Justification:** The report's confidence is high; the code is straightforward and safe. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states that the code is a typical setup script, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The risk score is very low, reflecting the benign nature.  \n- **Note:** The report mentions a \"securityRisk\" of 0.1, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the others; standard setup code with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No issues found; the code is safe.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the code is a typical setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also finds no malicious or obfuscated code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** Standard setup script, safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior.\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.5, but given the absence of any suspicious activity, a risk score of **0** is more appropriate.\n- Malware scores are correctly at **0** in all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** for all reports, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the assessments that this is a benign setup script with no security issues.**",
