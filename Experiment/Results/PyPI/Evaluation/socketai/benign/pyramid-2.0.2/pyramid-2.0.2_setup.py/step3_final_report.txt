  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'pyramid' Python package, defining dependencies, metadata, entry points, and reading static files for descriptions.",
  "sources": "Reading static files ('README.rst', 'CHANGES.rst') for long descriptions; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Static file reads for descriptions; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup.py script that reads local files and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It contains no dynamic code execution, network calls, or untrusted data handling. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The dependencies are standard, and the script's structure is conventional. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All signals confirm its safety, and the scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a very low security risk.",
