{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation and usage examples for a module that tracks results across applications using a tracker based on a shared base URI, supporting both file-based and tracker-based result passing.",
  "sources": "The code imports the FsspecResultTracker and ResultTracker classes from a local module, and uses the args object for input parameters in the examples.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform any data manipulation that could lead to leaks or security effects. It only shows how to instantiate and use tracker objects.",
  "flows": "The usage examples demonstrate the flow of data: computation results are stored in the tracker object in app1 and retrieved in app2, via the tracker interface.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code is mainly illustrative documentation and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily comments/documentation explaining how to use result tracking mechanisms across applications. It imports classes from a local module without any dynamic or unsafe code. The examples show no insecure practices, and the code is straightforward and standard in style.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as usage documentation for a result tracking system using the FsspecResultTracker. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
