  "purpose": "Documentation and usage explanation for passing results between applications using a result tracker, avoiding large data serialization.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .api module, specifically FsspecResultTracker and ResultTracker.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling within this snippet; references external classes.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only class import and descriptive comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; purely documentation and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments explaining usage patterns and an import statement. There is no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The imported classes are external or internal modules, but their implementation is not provided here. The comments clarify how to use the result tracker for inter-application communication, either via files or shared tracking service. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as documentation and interface setup for a result tracking system. There are no security concerns or malicious indicators. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and appropriate.",
