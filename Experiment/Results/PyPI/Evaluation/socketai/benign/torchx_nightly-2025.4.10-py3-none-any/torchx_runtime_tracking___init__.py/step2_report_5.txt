  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely documentation and an import statement; no executable logic or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; documentation and import, no runtime code or suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The code is safe and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—documentation and import, no actual data processing or network activity.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, just documentation and import statements, no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—documentation and import, no executable code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports contain only documentation and import statements, with no executable code or data processing.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Security Risk:** No security risks are evident; the code is purely illustrative.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 for all reports.\n\n**Note:** Since the actual classes (`FsspecResultTracker`, `ResultTracker`) are imported from an internal module `.api`, their implementation could have security implications, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are benign, primarily documentation and import statements, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
