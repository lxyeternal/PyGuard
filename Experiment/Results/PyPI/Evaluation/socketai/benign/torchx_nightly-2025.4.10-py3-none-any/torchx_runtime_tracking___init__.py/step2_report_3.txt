  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is purely documentation and an import statement (`from .api import FsspecResultTracker, ResultTracker`).\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing occurs here; the code only references external classes.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The classes are imported, but their implementation is outside this snippet.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely documentation and import.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear comments and code)  \n- Risk: 0 (no executable logic or data handling)  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on documentation about passing results via trackers. No runtime code beyond import statements.  \n- No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, documentation and usage examples with import statements. No executable code or data processing.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous, mainly descriptive comments and import statement. No active code or data flow.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also primarily documentation with import statements and detailed comments. No data handling or network activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports are about documentation and import statements, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity within the provided snippets.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate given the content.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the entire analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThere is no evidence in these snippets to suggest malicious intent or security issues. The code is purely informational and structural, serving as guidance for using a result tracking system.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk levels.",
