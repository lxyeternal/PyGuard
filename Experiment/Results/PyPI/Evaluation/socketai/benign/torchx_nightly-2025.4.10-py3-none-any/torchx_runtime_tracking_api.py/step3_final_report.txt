{
  "purpose": "Abstract base class for result tracking with a concrete implementation using fsspec to store results as JSON.",
  "sources": "Method parameters 'key' and 'results' passed to 'put' and 'get' functions.",
  "sinks": "Storage backend accessed via fsspec's get_mapper, no untrusted data sinks within the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs to storage in 'put', and from storage to return in 'get'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard, transparent implementation of a result tracker. It serializes results as JSON and stores them via fsspec, which is a common storage abstraction. No external input processing or network activity occurs within this code snippet. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.1) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a result tracker with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores and assessments across the reports are accurate and justified.",
