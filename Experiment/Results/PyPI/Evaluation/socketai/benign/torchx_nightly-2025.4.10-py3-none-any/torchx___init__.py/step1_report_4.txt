{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and import version-related metadata for a Python package, likely related to a Meta project or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own version information and image constant from a relative import (.version).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: importing version info from a local module and exposing it; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is simple and standard for package metadata definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header file that imports version information and an image constant from a relative module. There are no external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data processing. The licensing comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module header defining version information for a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
