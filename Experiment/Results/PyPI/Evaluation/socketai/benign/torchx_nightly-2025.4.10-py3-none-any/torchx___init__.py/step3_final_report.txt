  "purpose": "Import version and image constants from a local module for configuration or version management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .version module for __version__ and TORCHX_IMAGE.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "None; static import without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module that imports constants for versioning and configuration. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The import statements are typical and safe. The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling indicate it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import pattern with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
